B07BTS2KWK,1,1,Great for amateur digital artist,Emily,5,Yes,30-Jul-18,798,9,"I've had this iPad for just a few weeks but I love it. It arrived brand new in original packaging with all the standard accessories. I bought the iPad for the sole purpose of using it to start getting into digital art. When I say sole purpose, I mean I only use this iPad for ProCreate. I never have the internet on or use it for videos since I use my MacAir or iPhone for those things. I purchased the Apple Pencil and it works wonderfully on this iPad. For anyone who is interested in this more budget iPad for digital art or taking notes, I would recommend it.

I bought a case for the iPad and it isn't as light as you might think. It has some weight to it. So if you are someone who really needs a REALLY lightweight tablet, this might not be great.

The battery life so far is amazing. But, like I said before I don't have the internet on or any other app running besides ProCreate when I am using it.

Maybe in two years this little guy won't be running so great, but for right now I am so pleased with my purchase. The one thing I might regret is not buying the one with more GB of memory.

If you are looking into breaking into digital art, or would like to start doing digital illustrations, I would recommend this. However, for someone who has a good grasp of digital art or has used a previous tablet, consider the size of this tablet. If you need a lot of space to draw, this screen size might be too small and you should consider the 10 or 12 inch ipad Pro line. I have small hands and haven't ever used a tablet to draw before so it works great for me."
B07BTS2KWK,1,2,"Good value and performance,",Jacqueline DeMaio,5,Yes,12-Jul-18,455,4,"I am really enjoying my new iPad, and I’m so glad I paid a little extra for the extra storage (128GB) so I never again have to second-guess downloading something I really want due to space concerns, Also love the color - somewhere between Apple’s rose gold and regular gold. I do a lot or reading on my device, and the white border is easier on my eyes for that."
B07BTS2KWK,1,3,crispiest screen ever,T Rays,5,Yes,13-Aug-18,324,3,"The clarity of the pictures and everything on my ipad is very very impressive. I have an iphone and for other purposes use dell and asus window computers. The size is great. Some things require some more research, like how to get extensions added to safari, but thanks to the internet questions like these are quickly resolved.
If you like clear pictures and text and easy navigation, then the iPad is for you. I noticed that the battery drains a lot slower than on my iPhone, but then it seems to take a while to charge once it is drained. Plugging it in at night should always give me an ipad ready to go.
So happy with this purchase."
B07BTS2KWK,1,4,Continues to underwhelm,Josiah Brush,3,Yes,13-Nov-18,263,11,"I bought this to replace an iPad Air which was stolen. The Air was 4-6 years old so I thought this would be a big improvement. Nope. Same screen size, same WiFi connectivity, Bluetooth, interface. The only thing new was the touchpad ID system, which I do appreciate. The voice-to text feature was less functional than my moto x4, which costs 1/3 of this iPad.

I’ve had this notebook for four months and it continues to underwhelm. It’s gotten to the point where I mostly use it to read books or watch videos."
B07BTS2KWK,1,5,Awesome tablet! A must have for me and what ...,pcc,5,Yes,24-Jul-18,247,1,Awesome tablet! A must have for me and what I have been using it for.....Apple is nice and I use android a lot so… This was a big unknown for me… buy one you won’t regret it…you may want to grab one with a little more memory if you need that but for me and my wife 32 gigs was more than enough…
B07BTS2KWK,1,6,Difficult to open using your wifi code. Speakers on the bottom and not easy to hear.,Old seabass,4,Yes,08-Nov-18,220,12,"The IPad came factory sealed in a white box. I had some issues. You are allowed to try and enter your wifi security code up to ten times. Each time I had entered the correct code to unlock and use wifi, a message had said incorrectly. I did not expect issues or problems for the cash spent. I called up my cable provider, they came to the house, and reset the modem and router. Mind you, the wifi code was correct, and the modem and router were working just fine allowing network access. After some hair pulling, I turned on the iPad and was able to connect, and set up said iPad. Let this be a lesson to those that expect a problem-free product from Apple. If you cannot set up using your wifi code, turn off the modem and router for ten minutes, then turn it on, then turn on the pad. If this won't work, call cable. If that won't work, box it and send it back. You should not have to go to iTunes because you had tried ten times to unlock your iPad. Nothing is worth that trouble, and frankly, even once restored to factory settings, the same issue will persist. Otherwise, product arrived in great condition from the seller, well packed and after some struggle worked fine. Had this issue continued, seller would have this iPad right back special delivery. One star off for the hassle."
B07BTS2KWK,1,7,"Remember, this is only 32 GB!",C.Hawkins,5,Yes,23-Aug-18,230,5,I’ve had iPads since the very first one. They just keep getting better. This is no exception. I’m looking forward to being able to use the new Apple Pencil with this iPad. Info says it’s compatible with this model. My only regret is that they dropped the 64GB version. But 32GB is sufficient for me. I’m learning some options to reduce what is actually stored here. But it is a joy.
B07BTS2KWK,1,8,Great product!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,20-Jul-18,177,0,Very happy with my purchase :D I tested an iPad Pro and didn't see a huge difference. I use it mainly for digital art. Couldn't be happier.
B07BTS2KWK,1,9,Extremely fragile,Siyu,1,Yes,27-Jan-19,143,18,"I bought this iPad as Christmas gift for myself and together with the apple pencil I was planning on using them for a more productive semester at school. One day I put this iPad on the table(about 1.65 foot tall) and it dropped shortly after I left because of imbalance. I didn't even think what was about to happen as I used my iPad Air(first Generation) for years and it dropped multiple times from place much higher than this table. When I went check my iPad, I was shocked, the entire screen was broken, the tiny glass pieces falling off and cut my finger. I couldn't believe this screen being this fragile, if this wasn't me but a young kid I couldn't able to imagine how bad things could turn to. Apple shouldn't allow its product to has screen this fragile, it's definitely a safety concerns for all its consumers. I called Apple and hope they can help me, the people whom answered my phone call keep telling me there is nothing they can do, and my only option is to replace my screen for 249.99 (yes, exactly how much I got this iPad). This whole thing is so ridiculous, I've never seen a electronic product being this fragile. For all of you thinking about buying this product, please make sure you got yourself a case, for your own safety."
B07BTS2KWK,1,10,It's an Apple product,Amazon Customer,4,Yes,17-Oct-18,105,3,"I bought this for my wife as some game updates for it meant she could no longer play some of the games with her friends so she had to move from iPad 3 to iPad 6.
It seems she finds the iPad easier to use than an Android device - beats me why, I've always found Android to be simpler and more powerful to control. I guess that's it, really, Android is makes it easier to get more from a device while Apple maintains it's 'walled garden' approach.
As for the iPad itself; it works and that's about all I can say for it.
Moving data from my wife's old iPad to the new one proved to take over two exhausting, infuriating days - for me - she can't manipulate the thing at all. I hate Apple products and think the world would be better without them, but there it is.
I've given this device 4 starts based on my wife's rating, if it was mine, I would give it a one star, simply because it worked when I turned it on.
Full marks, however, to the suppliers, Laptops Inc, for a first rate service."
B07BTS2KWK,2,11,Stopped working in less than 3 months!!,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,04-Dec-18,106,6,Just bought this iPad in September and it has stopped working. Can’t even cut it on. I haven’t dropped it or gotten it wet. What is my recourse?!!!
B07BTS2KWK,2,12,Box was empty!!!,Melissa Clark,1,Yes,05-Feb-19,98,4,"I received an empty box. It appeared sealed. When I opened it, there were 3 white ceramic tiles glued in the box where the iPad should have been! I thought that was odd and maybe the iPad was underneath. It wasn’t. The only other thing in the box was the charger. I look forward to receiving my actual iPad when I send this back."
B07BTS2KWK,2,13,I know other people of had luck but I would stay away.,Dustin Andert,1,Yes,31-Dec-18,75,1,"I was very hesitant about buying this product from a third-party and it turns out I was right. I’ve only had this product 10 days and it’s having an issue holding a charge. The first time was about five days ago, I was watching a YouTube video. I noticed the battery draining pretty rapidly while plugged in to a charger. I moved it to three different outlets and it took four hours to go from 93% to 99%. It has stayed on charge since until two days ago when I visited my parents. When I got home and put it back on charge. I noticed the battery draining. I moved it to four different outlets, used for different chords, and three different adapters. It is been charging now for 26 hours straight and still losing battery life. This is with Wi-Fi turned off, it being on airplane mode, and the brightness turned off. Not to mention no apps are running. Somehow, I am responsible for 50% of the cost of them sending me a defective product? I know other people of had luck but I would stay away."
B07BTS2KWK,2,14,Best tablet for the money,Lantana Al,4,Yes,25-Nov-18,63,1,"Great tablet for the money. I'm an Android phone person but there's really no competition with iOS in the tablet department. Yes Apple sometimes drives me crazy with their ""high security"" and bugs but overall it's still the best tablet for the money in quality, longevity, frequent updates, and resell value. The Android tablets I have bought are all cheaper but I never seem to end up getting anywhere close to the use I get from Apple tablets so the Android tablets don't really end up being the better buy in the end.

UPDATE 2019-02-11: Still a good tablet overall but I'm lowering my rating to 4 stars because Apple security is ""nuts"". It just wasted my time signing me out of stuff and forcing my to change my password. Really annoying when you are trying to get stuff done and you have to keep entering your Apple ID and password for anything to work and for all the annoying prompts to go away long enough for you to do something."
B07BTS2KWK,2,15,All your dreams have come true,AmazonGirl,5,Yes,17-Dec-18,53,2,"Ordered the new iPad because the sale was too good to let go. I had wanted the iPad Apple Pencil pair, so being able to get both for the price of just the iPad after tax was worth it. Apple got us, yet again. Not that I mind though, I love my apple products. This iPad is a great example. I will primarily be using it for digital art/graphic design/photo editing adobe type programs. I’ve used half the Wacom models, including the cintique. Haven’t had a chance to use the new iPad Pro and pencil, but for the more affordable version, this earns all 5 stars.

#1, gorgeous screen, easy to set up, easy to use right out of the box. Set up is even easier now if you have another apple device. The setup prompt me to grab an apple device logged into my account already. From there I entered my passcode on my phone, before I knew it the iPad was asking if I wanted all my apps brought over, or if I wanted to start fresh. They took what I thought was already a pretty easy process thanks to iCloud, and made it even more user friendly.

#2, it feels like the money you spent. Unlike other android devices I have attempted, iOS devices have never let me down in the quality department. This being said, it’s not as light as the kindle fire or what have you, but it’s going to last longer and be a more enjoyable experience over all for the extra couple of ounces. It’s not heavy compared to my MacBook, which is why I have it. Fits in my purse while still being a gorgeous screen to watch movies on. Retina displays will change your life, and ruin every other screen you look at.

#3, the Apple Pencil. I get it now. And do not regret a single penny spent. The pressure sensitivity, accuracy of the accelerometer, how fast it charges, and how the pen to screen experience is closer to paper than anything I’ve ever used. I’m talking Wacom Cintique level accuracy on a tablet. It feels unreal. I love my moleskines more than the next person, but I’m worried they might be getting less use in the coming months just because this is so user friendly.

I’ll be sure to add battery details or any updates, but those 3 alone were enough to sell me on the purchase."
B07BTS2KWK,2,16,Good & Bad !?!,BIGFINGERS,4,Yes,10-Dec-18,50,3,"If you like Apple, you will like it. If you are not an Apple person, and are used too Android and ""OK Google,"" you may not like it. I love Windows and its problems, then Andorid, others, and Apple last. But as a tablet, its good for the price--and I like it, almost love it! Could love it if not for limitation Apple had deliberately implemented. I would give a 3 1/2 Stars but there is no option for that!

The Bad:
1) ""Siri"" is inferior when compare to ""OK Google!""
2) Apple is very limited to customizing, very limited! Apple removes the fun and does not allow one to use as one would like to. Apple choose for you. If you want freedom of use, and are a free thinker, Apple is not for you.
3) Bloatware apps that cannot be removed which includes news medial outlets. If you have a liberal mind set, you will like the preselected news outlets. If you are conservative, moderate or want no bias of any political party, to bad. You can't remove preselected news or add new media outlets that are not left. But you can down load the app of the dersed news media outlet as an option. I like hear both side and not be forced to one side or the other. I have capacity and will to think and can decide for myself. Just give me the facts, not opinion.
4) Apple wants to use your location all the time for just about everythig -- not cool! If you don't turn on the location, many apps will not work. Seriously!?!

The Good:
1) Battery Life - Amazing!!! Beyond Good!
2) Speeker Quality - quite good, surprisingly.
3) Screen is Good, not Samsung screen quality, but Good!
4) Smooth Functionallity
5) Durable and Quality build for sure!"
B07BTS2KWK,2,17,Perfect Match for Casual Use,craigk49,4,Yes,05-Feb-19,37,0,"Amazon Review

Passes all of the tests

I was reluctant to buy because some of the details on Amazon’s product page seemed a bit vague. I didn’t want to end up with a refurbished nightmare. I’m glad I made the plunge!

It arrived on the promised date. The packaging was typical high quality Amazon.

I was glad to see a pristine Apple box complete with shrink wrap in place. The Apple box was in pristine condition just as though I just brought it home from my local Apple store. So far, so good.

After removing the heat shrink and sliding the box apart, I was greeted with Apples typical new device presentation. The iPad was enveloped in the clear plastic wrap and thoughtful tab used to lift the iPad up and out of the box easily.

I carefully examined the iPad and it was free of fingerprints, scratches, dings and dents. In short, just like it should for a brand new Apple device. I smiled.

After charging the battery, I proceeded to the set up. This was super easy as most of the set up info was transferred from the iPhone. It went smoothly with no glitches to speak of. The only “work” was to reactivate a few non-Apple apps. That went quickly.

As much as I love the iPad bare back (Space Gray) I am aware that due to size and weight, surviving even small drops could yield far worse than than an iPhone. So, I installed an Otter Box Defender. Visually as ugly as the iPad is beautiful bare back. Small price to pay for protecting the iPad from me. LOL!

After reading reports of broken screens even in Defender cases, I opted to get AppleCare as a backup. After fiddling around in Apple Support and getting nowhere, I called Apple and a very helpful service rep walked me through the process. He even helped me set up a few other things and I had AppleCare in less than an hour. It took longer because I’m still adapting to how things work. I come from the world of PowerBooks and desktop Macs.

The ability to purchase AppleCare also tells me that this is not an Amazon or 3rd party refurbish. Only new devices that have never been registered sold are eligible for AppleCare. And only for 60 days after warranty start date. I smiled again.

I tested the battery by topping off the battery and disconnecting the power. Then proceeded to watch movies, read emails, cruise the web, etc. The low charge warnings appeared at the 10 hour mark. I smiled. Exactly what is expected for a new iPad.

Should you get one? Depends on how you plan to use it. For the average user, this will cover all the bases. If you are more of a power user, then you may need to move up to the iPad Pro series.

Based on my experience, I’m satisfied with Amazon, and this iPad. If you have no heavy use needs I’m sure you will be just as happy. Highly recommended!"
B07BTS2KWK,2,18,"Brand new as described, still in original package!",Abby,5,Yes,12-Oct-18,44,0,"Product arrived in the original package, seal still intact. Package arrived promptly and as described. iPad is gorgeous and is exactly what I was looking for! I was on the fence about purchasing an Apple product through Amazon, but everything came as promised and it works amazing! Would highly recommend!"
B07BTS2KWK,2,19,the product arrived in perfect condition,fernanda altamirano,5,Yes,05-Dec-18,56,0,"I love my new iPad, I arrive in perfect condition, with all its accessories. It works perfectly."
B07BTS2KWK,2,20,worth the upgrade if you have an Air 2,dreemsnake,5,Yes,27-Sep-18,38,0,"Much faster and less glitchy than my Air 2, battery lasts longer, no longer have trouble finding nearby networks. I know people said it’s not worth the upgrade if you have an Air 2 but it was totally worth it to me."
B07BTS2KWK,3,21,Working great. Thanks,GLENN A. LOPEZ,5,Yes,17-Jul-18,41,1,Arrived extremely quick and just as advertised. New and in box with all accessories. Working great. Thanks!

B07BTS2KWK,3,23,it is criminal to release mobile device with 2gb ram this day,anonymous,1,-,22-Nov-18,56,11,it is criminal to release mobile device with 2gb ram this day. and then cash grab with pro version with 4gb.
B07BTS2KWK,3,24,Don’t buy Apple products from amazon.,Marianne Nicole,1,Yes,16-Jan-19,32,3,Absolutely horrible.. don’t ever buy Apple products from amazon. My iPad is a WEEK old and won’t hold a charge. It’s been plugged in the charger for 2 hours and is on 1%..
B07BTS2KWK,3,25,Amazon does not record SNs,Kindle Customer,1,Yes,05-Feb-19,31,4,"I purchased a 32GB iPad from Amazon for a family member for Christmas. during the festivities it was set up incorrectly, and locked to an account that does not exist. Only way to fix the issue requires a proof of purchase to ensure Apple is not getting scammed. Apparently Amazon does not record what SN you bought in a place that can be accessed by the end user, nor can support staff provide the info. Until this is rectified, I would not recommend purchasing from Amazon."
B07BTS2KWK,3,26,Awesome,sheydasaadat,5,Yes,24-Nov-18,76,0,looks great i just got it. works perfectly. can pair with apple pencil.
B07BTS2KWK,3,27,"Great hardware, but Apple's is too restrictive.",Steven J. Gutierrez,3,Yes,23-Feb-19,21,0,"The Apple iPad (latest model): That's a rather confusing description of the product, don't you think? What's next years model going to be called? Will they refer to last year's model then as ""the second-to-the-latest-model?"" I ordered the iPad to create a song using Garage band. It came in a white box with ""iPad"" printed on it, and included the device, a charger and cable, and a warranty card. The cable was wrapped with a piece of cardboard rather than a twist-tie, which was weird, and not too easy to put back that way. The tablet is so thin and sleek, you really want to buy a case for it immediately, because it's difficult to hold otherwise. It is quite impressive how thin they can make these consumer computers. You still get a headphone jack with this model (thanks for spending the extra dollars Apple), but no microSD slot to add storage or move files (they saved a few bucks there). It powered on with a friendly ""Hello"" on the screen, and everything worked as intended. It is responsive, clear, colorful, and sounds beautiful. It is perfect for consuming the news on the internet, checking emails, etc. Garage Band was fun to use, sounds great, but over simplified to the point where you are looking for back buttons that don't exist. I wanted to clear my song and start over, so I pressed ""New"". It kept pulling up my full song. I created another song, and then tried to offload it to my PC by connecting it via USB. The only access to the unit from File Manager is the DCIM folder. Apple locks you out of seeing what else is on the device. Since it automatically uploaded my song to the iCloud, the only way to get to it was to download and install an iCloud program. This means Apple sees everything I can possibly create with the iPAD. At that point, I decided to return it, and stay away from Apple's ""walled garden"". Apple's software is too proprietary for me, and so over-simplified, it actually gets harder to figure out how to do some technical things on it. However, I can see the appeal for those who need something with ""Fisher-Price"" simplicity."
B07BTS2KWK,3,28,Sure you want/need to upgrade?,Buttonsvixen,4,Yes,03-Dec-18,21,2,"Sure it's a fancy new ipad, with a nice new cord and pretty screen. But, on using it, it's not THAT much greater than the Ipad Air gen one I was replacing. I only got this to use with the apple pencil, so I'm not really disappointed. But. It seems nearly the same size and weight. It's hard to tell the two apart in fact. Maybe it does have a longer battery life. But my air is four years old by now, so there is that. Camera doesn't seem that much better. Speakers definitely are not any better. It does have fingerprint sign on. Which the air doesn't, but big whoop. You still need a numerical pass code anyway, in case you forget your fingerprints, or something."
B07BTS2KWK,3,29,Happy Birthday to ME!,@drdijones,5,Yes,21-Aug-18,25,0,"I just got this for my birthday this month. So I'm still learning new ways to use it, but I absolutely love it. It replaced an ipad I had for years. I am thrilled with everything about it."
B07BTS2KWK,3,30,My new iPad is USED!,LFOD,1,Yes,02-Mar-19,21,1,"UMMMM WHAT? I received Janette's iPad. All signed in and everything. Country set to Canada. Huge PITA to sign out of everything and change country settings. After all the work I am not going to return it, but come on man! If this is new then i am Ethel Merman (see who doesn't have to google that one)"
B07BTS2KWK,4,31,iPad 9.7 arrived DOA,Dave,3,Yes,06-Dec-18,23,0,The first iPad 9.7 I received would only display apple logo then screen went black. Apple support indicated it was a hardware issue. Amazon did a good job of sending a replacement 4 or 5 days later. Second one worked fine.
B07BTS2KWK,4,32,Pretty rose gold color,Rebecca,4,Yes,08-Oct-18,22,0,"It came in it’s original packaging and looked very nice and sleek and pretty. My only complaint about the product itself is that the screen feels like plastic and very delicate. I bought a glass screen protector to put over it because I was very afraid it would break.

Edit: i have started to have a few problems with this crashing on me occasionally where it has the black loading screen with the spinning wheel in the middle of doing something and then it goes back to the lock screen. Not a huge deterrent, but I would like for it to... not do that? It could lead to something bigger. I didn’t buy Apple care for this though so I don’t think I can do anything about it now."
B07BTS2KWK,4,33,THE DARN THING IS NOT GOLD! IT'S ROSE GOLD ...,Janet N Caruso,5,Yes,26-Jul-18,26,1,"Delivered quick, The color is Rose Gold NOT Gold....New Works great so far"
B07BTS2KWK,4,34,Upgraded From An Older Model,Jim,5,Yes,12-Dec-18,21,0,"My iPad 2 served me well but being 7 years old, the performance and battery life became too annoying to put up with. The latest iPad has exceptional battery life and its processor keeps navigation smooth and fast. I was particularly impressed and surprised how fast and easy it was to set up, using iTunes and my iPhone to wirelessly import all of my apps and settings."
B07BTS2KWK,4,35,Good quality.,Dong Jae Lim,5,Yes,04-Dec-18,25,0,Good quality. I liked it. Fast delivery

B07BTS2KWK,4,39,Works perfect with Apple pencil,Edgar Hernandez,5,Yes,27-Aug-18,22,0,"It works perfect, fast and with plenty of battery work hours, this model works with apple pencil with no issues"
B07BTS2KWK,4,40,Forget About Anything Else and Go With Apple,believeinthestars,5,Yes,06-Oct-18,20,0,"I decided to go with what Android braggers were saying and gave a Samsung Galaxy tablet a try... in less than a week I was so frustrated with how neanderthal it was, I returned that Galaxy and will never go there again!"
B07BTS2KWK,5,41,Why Pay Apple $1000 for an iPad Pro When You Can Have This For A 1/3 Price,Rodster,5,Yes,03-Dec-18,17,0,"I'm a huge Apple fan but Apple's pricing has gone a bit, how shall I say it on the greedy side. No way would I spend $500 on a tablet in 2018. The Budget iPad is the perfect combination of price and performance. I purchased this when Amazon was selling them for $249 and it's tough to beat that price for what you get. The tablet industry has matured but Apple still makes the best, cohesive and easy to use tablets."
B07BTS2KWK,5,42,AMAZING,Jessica Mia,5,Yes,09-Dec-18,16,0,"I've never owned an ipad before but since getting an iphone I thought I'd spoil myself and plunge into the apple world. Upon opening I was really surprised at how great it looked, very light and it was super easy to set up (this coming from the least tech savvy person you'd ever meet). I also use this for school and it comes in handy having a digital copy of my textbooks, starting projects on it, or word documents. This is just all around a great product, it got to me before expected and was handed directly to me, so no worries of someone getting my new investment. I highly recommend!"
B07BTS2KWK,5,43,Amazing apple product (as always),Min-Ho Lee,5,Yes,06-Dec-18,13,1,"I purchased the iPad 6th generation (2018) 128GB in the gold color. Apple recently changed their gold to a more bronze color that is basically between their old gold color and rose gold (and I love it). I took advantage of the black friday sale and saved a lot of money.

PROS:
1) This model works with the first generation apple pencil and it works very well (palm rejection works well and little to no lag).
2) There is a headphone jack and a lighting charging port so you can listen and charge at the same time (yay!)
3) The color is gorgeous.
4) The split screen function is great and allow some you to operate more than one app at the same time. Some apps work better than others but when it comes to a drawing app and a reference picture.
5) The speakers are pretty nice and definitely are louder than my phone.
6) The battery lasts pretty long. I usually go 2-3 days until I need to charge it again.
7) Amazjng price for an iPad. I would recommend for students especially because of the great price.
(there are many more pros but these were most important)

CONS:
1) This model of the iPad does NOT use a laminated screen so the gap between the surface of the glass and the screen itself is much bigger and is much more noticeable when drawing. Not a huge deal but the iPad pro line definitely does not have this problem.
2) This iPad does not have pressure sensitivity so it does not support 3D touch shortcuts (also not the hat big of a deal but it became a common habit on my phone).
3) This is an entry level iPad, so the processor is not as fast as the pro and the screen is smaller.

Overall, this was an amazing purchase and I would recommend this product. If you are thinking about getting yourself or someone else an iPad, go for it!"
B07BTS2KWK,5,44,Super quick delivery and arrived as advertised!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,01-Sep-18,16,1,Super quick delivery and iPad was brand new as advertised. The iPad came with a good charge as well. I was afraid of paying for a new iPad and receiving a re-conditioned one so I was happy to see that the seller was honest and trustworthy.
B07BTS2KWK,5,45,Awful sound speaker came broken! Not new!,Tony,1,Yes,16-Jan-19,13,0,"Received iPad, excited for my step daughter on Christmas, found that the iPad once turned on, on Christmas Day and straight from box, speaker makes a awful sound for no reason. Almost as if speaker is blown, suppose to be new, doubt it. I am beyond disappointed more so for my step daughter that was super excited when she opened. Can’t be used because of awful sound!"
B07BTS2KWK,5,46,Half the pro for half the price,Antonio M,4,Yes,01-Dec-18,13,0,I have owned several generations of iPad and this one is not the worst. The cameras are old and dingy but do the job. The display and body are from the air 1. If you want this with apple pencil it will not be as smooth and realistic as the pro models it runs at 60hz which is half of the pro but it does work well. Overall good iPad for the price and has enough power to use for school with apple pencil support .
B07BTS2KWK,5,47,"Perfect for Children to Finish their School Works (IPad 6th Gen, 2018 Model)",Comnul,5,Yes,27-Nov-18,12,0,"Elementary school requires kid to search information to write and draw about certain topics.
I think this 6th generation Ipad is the perfect for children to finish their school works.
You can use the first generation apple pencils with this iPad model (Apple 1st Generation Pencil: additional $100 )."
B07BTS2KWK,5,48,A Serious Upgrade from 16GB iPad,JCArcht,5,Yes,11-Jan-19,9,1,"This time around, I purchased this iPad with 128 GB and both Wi-Fi and Data. Overall, I'm liking this new iPad. The display is awesome, and the upgraded iPad allows me to utilize the latest apps. An example of this is the Microsoft Word app, which has much of the word processing features of my computer version. I noticed that the battery life seems to be longer. My third-party pen works well on the apps which support it. About all that this iPad can not do that a laptop can do is computer-aided building design. The Cellular data option allows me to use it online anywhere rather than depend upon public wi-fi. Data downloads are fast. However, be aware that a good data plan will cost you a bundle. I tried shopping data plans for my iPad and many of the bargain cell data providers do not support iPads. I use this iPad for presentations, for field reports, and for internet and email access while out of the office."
B07BTS2KWK,5,49,6th Gen iPad!,TamBerine:,5,Yes,18-Dec-18,13,0,It is great! This is the 6th gen iPad.
B07BTS2KWK,5,50,Not a new product! You’re buying a referbb that doesnt work,Lindgay,1,Yes,17-Jan-19,13,1,Received my iPad today and it is bricked straight out of the box. It has clearly been used before and sent back to the facility. The box didn’t have the plastic in it and was dented all the hell. Product will not take charge or turn on.
B07BTS2KWK,6,51,Used. Beware,L.B.,1,Yes,30-Dec-18,14,1,iPad was used. It was locked and linked to someone else’s iTunes. Can’t use.
B07BTS2KWK,6,52,Takes Hours to setup,Marie,1,Yes,06-Feb-19,9,1,"I am so sick and tired of waiting for this Ipad to start working. It's so frustrating. I had spent over 2 hours trying to login to my WIFI. I have never had similar issues logging in with Android. Now that it finally logged in, It's been over an hour and the screen is stuck saying ""It may take a few minutes to activate your Ipad.""
I paid expedited shipping to have it delivered sooner and now I have to go and get an Android Pad. I really regret getting this Ipad.
The setup is Not at all user-friendly."
B07BTS2KWK,6,53,It’s great,Deborah A. Helpard,5,Yes,30-Aug-18,13,0,"It’s my 2nd iPad, love them"
B07BTS2KWK,6,54,Great for drawing and notes,wendy,5,Yes,12-Oct-18,11,0,"Works great so far. Definitely in brand new condition. The only trouble I had was that the iPad would not charge over 66% for some reason but after restarting, it charged again. I love the drawing capabilities and it’s so much easier to take notes or do assignments outside of class."
B07BTS2KWK,6,55,Best bang for the buck,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,20-Nov-18,11,0,"I've had both the Apple and Samsung tablets, both are good but I keep going back to the Apple because it just seems to be a little better in all areas."
B07BTS2KWK,6,56,"Nothing wrong with seller, everything wrong with product",Shopaholic Shopper,1,Yes,17-Mar-19,6,2,"What is wrong with the Apple quality these days? Never buying another one of these. Apple is expensive because it’s understood that it’s a premium product and you’re getting the best possible device for the money you invest. That’s why I’ve always bought their products. My Air 2 was great, lasted YEARS...I’ve dropped it. Accidentally fell asleep with it. I’ve travelled MILES with it; not so much as a hint of a fracture or splinter. I loved it but wanted the ability to draw so I bought this version. The screen feels CHEAP as hell and now I know why. It was dropped once from a small height and it spiderwebbed horribly in the corner but I taped it and it was fine although there were these really dangerous glass splinters left over. I bought another one in the meanwhile cause I thought, oh I’ll just be really careful with this new one. But the first one that fell is just deteriorating further with use and now I know why. It’s absolutely hollow beneath the screen. You tap on it and you can hear it. Now that my screen is falling apart, I can SEE it. And now my screen is a lawsuit waiting to happen. The glass dust could easily get into your eyes or be inhaled and do some real damage. I don’t think my Air 2 has this flaw. It’s solidly built. This is not. What a mistake that I heavily regret buying. It wasn’t even that much an improvement over my previous iPad. It’s just that I can draw on this one. T_T learn from my mistakes. Apple is going downhill. Not worth buying their new products."
B07BTS2KWK,6,57,Fragile Fragile Fragile,Alvin,1,Yes,06-Mar-19,9,0,"Long story short. The glass screen broke, with an expansive all protective case plus screen protector. This thing is a joke. I should have bought amazon tablet instead of this joke of a product. And now Apple wants 249 to replace the screen. Literally the same it costed. Very disappointed, low quality."
B07BTS2KWK,6,58,Chip on the side of the iPad,Daisy,1,Yes,25-Dec-18,9,0,"I purchased this iPad as a gift and just opened it tonight to activate it. It has been in its box the entire time and when I was looking at it, i noticed that it had a chip on the side. There is no way that I could have done this in the 5 minutes from me having it. Complete fail. I’m gonna try to return this. Buy your apple products directly from the apple store."
B07BTS2KWK,6,59,My New iPad!,H. Johnson,5,Yes,07-Apr-19,5,0,"Wow! After using my iPad for the last (who knows how many) years, I was so pleased with this new and improved model.
First of all, the delivery was outstanding! I ordered it on a Wednesday afternoon. It arrived by noon the following day! Shipping was free with Prime. I just wasn't expecting to find next day delivery free!

It arrived in Apple's iconic white box. I opened it up, turned it on, and set up was complete within about 20 minutes.

The only time consuming task was to organize my apps as they are on my other devices. That took a little bit of brain power, (a bit organizationally challenged!) but before long, things were as I wanted them.

I was so impressed with the display. It is very sharp and crisp. The speed and sensitivity that this iPad have are wonderful.

I watched a favorite movie of mine that I had purchased from iTunes years ago. (My Dog Skip) And as I wiped my tears at the the end, it truly had me mesmerized how slick the whole thing is.

I was able to access our streaming service and just like everything else, it was effortless and rather addicting! I am disciplining myself to limit my screen time lately, so hopefully I'll remain the boss of my devices, instead of the other way around!

I purchased the Apple smart cover to go with it. (midnight blue, in case you're curious) I will leave my review for it as well, but for now, let me just say, it fits beautifully!

The color of the iPad itself is Space Grey. I was hesitant, but so happy with my choice. The fingerprints are quite invisible, as opposed to the silver finish I'm used to. It's quite pleasant to look at, which isn't a bad thing!

I love the battery life. So far, I've been able to get through my usual book reading, a full length movie, and check my email and visit my favorite sites with plenty of juice to spare. It charges up quickly, although I don't know exactly the time frame, as I usually plug it in at night.

Would I recommend this? If you don't have a television in the bedroom and want a small, unobtrusive alternative; if you enjoy reading your books online, but your laptop it too large at times and your smart phone is too small; if you are a bit quirky and love Apple devices, YES, I highly recommend this to you!

I'll come back and update my review as time goes on.
(I really tried to capture a photo that did justice to the display, but with my lighting, there were all kinds of reflections. Perhaps with my next review!)"
B07BTS2KWK,6,60,Is it good for Art? Answer is 100% yes. It is fantastic for art.,Solomon,5,Yes,08-Mar-19,5,1,"# Preface: The Generic Tablet Overview #
You already know it is an iPad meaning it is an excellent high-quality tablet with tons of feature, good performance, beautiful screen, etc. If you want to buy a tablet, yes buy this or a newer one if your budget allows it. No question about ""is the tablet worth it"".

# Privacy #
Also, Apple is big on User Privacy unlike other large companies so better them than some other tablet.

# Main: The Art Overview #
It is perfect for something twice its price point. You can make comics, portraits, sketches, everything very nicely and professionally on it. And drawing directly on something is so much nicer than drawing on an external tablet like a Wacom and looking at the screen.

So why this over the larger newer iPads that support the newer pencil? Price really. This is cheap. And performs like a $1000 piece of hardware.

-- Software is Important --
The iPad and Apple Pencil provide all the infrastructure, but to really bring it to professional quality use, you will need good appropriate Apps.

Use an App like ProCreate (top-notch all-around art program) or the pricier Clip Studio Pro (premium product for making comics). There are other products that do these things in their own style such as ComicDraw. These really provide a lot of capabilities to make it feel like you are just drawing on paper. Software quality will affect your experience.

-- The Artist Questions --
Does it have parallax? I haven't noticed it. It draws the line exactly where you expect it. If there is any, it is incredibly negligible; the glass layer and the screen are pretty tight together.

Is there jitter? Not noticeable either. I don't find it my work even when inking a sketch slowly.

Is there pressure sensitivity? Yes, plenty of it. How many levels I am not sure but I can get the lines how I want them gradually going from thin to thick. Software can build upon the built-in pressure sensitivity for additional effects.

Is there tilt response? Yes. When you tilt your pencil you can shade or draw thicker lines than if you don't.

Does it feel like it is gliding on glass? Yes, but I don't find it slippery where I can't control the lines. Doesn't have the same bite of paper where your pencil can come to a dead stop without you needing to hold your hand steady. Here you will need to keep your hand steady as there is no real friction to prevent the pencil from moving further. But it has not affected anything negatively.

Do you get a slight tapping sound when lifting and replacing the pencil? Yes, you do. Use a lighter hand for less noise. :)

What kind of art can it do? You can essentially do a complete pipeline from gestures and storyboarding, to initial and final sketches to inking to a full color, inked comic page ready to be published. Or a portrait or landscape. The software determines what styles and capabilities it has such as pencil vs chalk vs paintbrush.

I highly recommend this product for any artist beginner or intermediate (or advanced even) that is on a budget.

# Note #
It will take a few sketches and there is a learning curve since it is essentially a different medium. So like controlling a pencil is different than controlling a paint brush. Controlling this pencil is different. So give it a few drawings and invest some hours to get comfortable with it. I started a little clumsier but several hours later it feels as natural as paper."
B07BTS2KWK,7,61,Just what i wanted,Jason D.,5,Yes,21-Sep-18,8,0,"Its lived up to my expectations. Had an ipad mini before. Was ok at first but I found the screen 2b small for my taste. And it was VERY unresponsive and inconsistent. You can use firm pressure and nothing happens, then lightly brush against the screen then it responds. Very frustrating when playing gms. Its almost like the screen has dead spots. This ipad has none of these issues. Extremely consistent and reliable. When u tap the screen it picks it up and don't have too re-tap 2-3 times."
B07BTS2KWK,7,62,Ease to navigate.,Mom,5,Yes,05-Nov-18,10,0,I have been very pleased with this IPAD. It has met my expectation. It is easy to navigate. If you have any problems ask any teenage person and they can help.
B07BTS2KWK,7,63,Very disappointed,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,05-Jan-19,10,1,I was very disappointed with the IPad I purchased from amazon for my father for Christmas. He opened it brand new box everything appeared perfect until he set up the iPad and it stopped functioning.
B07BTS2KWK,7,64,Defective iPad,Jesse Williams,1,Yes,15-Jan-19,8,2,Bought this iPad as a gift for my daughter and she and I were both disappointed. When we tried to set it up the iPad kept trying to turn itself off as if we where holding the button to shut if off. Every 2-3 seconds the iPad would try to shut itself off without even being touched. Because of this it took almost 10 minutes just to set the iPad up. I tried doing a hard reset and updating the iPad and still nothing. Ended up returning it and going to try and get an iPad from somewhere else. It’s obvious that this iPad must have been used before and just resold as if nothing was wrong!
B07BTS2KWK,7,65,First Apple product failure,Aldo Wagnetti,1,Yes,11-Feb-19,7,0,"Brand new still in Apple wrapping would not work with the internet. minutes to connect with Google or Safari. Search results took forever to load. Internet apps would not run. I turned off everything. No Siri, location,and all apps ,still wouldn't run.
I-phones, Chromebooks running fine on house Wi-fi. Oh and I updated the ios. Looked for solutions on line but just found the usual. So back it goes"
B07BTS2KWK,7,66,No Flash for camera,D Williams,2,Yes,29-Nov-18,9,3,Apple must have started losing their edge. NO FLASH?? what good is a camera without a flash?
B07BTS2KWK,7,67,Great entry level tablet and works with pencil,David M. Gallagher,4,Yes,06-Jan-19,5,0,"I bought this for myself to see if a tablet oriented workflow could work for me at the office and at home. I didn’t want to spend iPad Pro money yet. But I needed the ability to take notes by hand and organize them.

The price before Christmas was rediculously good so I purchased and have been happy.

Pros:
-price - iPad under $300
-Good display
-A10 Chip is plenty powerful for entry level and beyond.
-Works with Apple Pencil (series 1)
-Compatible with all my iOS apps already purchased for iPhone.
-Relatively seameless is ntegration with iPhone and iCloud.

Cons:
-Although pencil works well it is a bit noisy especially if you print as opposed to write cursive. The air gap between the screen and display magnifies the tapping sound and has a bit of a hollow feel. Also it is only the first gen pencil that’s supported so you will have cap/charger/adapter situation that is far less sexy than the new pencil that only works with iPad Pro. If you are someone going to use the pencil a ton you should check out lowest price iPad Pro and the new Apple Pencil in person and compare.

Storage - 32 GB might not be enough depending on your use case. I don’t plan to store photos or video locally for the most part. Those are on my 128 gb iPhone. So 32GB is fine for me.

WiFi only - obviously you know that up front but you will find that on the go, places you expect to have WiFi will have dead spots and using your phone as a hotspot while ok is not always seamless coverage. Keeping in mind that with just 32 GB and a desire to share between devices you will likely be storing more and more data on the cloud. If you need 99%+ uptime reliable connectivity you might want to consider broadband cellular + WiFi.

Bottom line: A real iPad with pencil support and an upgraded processor for well under $300. Big thumbs up. Full time pencil users and power users might want to look to more memory models, cellular or low end pro models."
B07BTS2KWK,7,68,"At this price, no other tablet touches it.",Clearwater Amazonian,4,Yes,11-Feb-19,4,0,"I'm a longtime Windows/Android guy. I don't dislike Apple, but I've never(until now) owned an Apple product. When my ancient Samsung Android tablet got annoying to use, I figured I'd replace it. About a year ago, I went with a Kindle Fire HD 10; I then proceeded to install the Google Services on it(since it doesn't come with them). I thought for the price, it would be adequate, but I got increasing frustrated with the performance and began to look elsewhere. I began looking at Android tablets and sadly found that the Android tablet market has dried up considerably. Google doesn't even offer one anymore(they've started pushing Chrome OS for tablets). Turns out to get the Android tablet I wanted(Galaxy Tab S4), I'd have to pay at least 500 bucks(no thanks). Faced with this, I went ahead and bit the bullet and bought my first iPad. I have to say, I don't regret it at all. For 249, you get a fast, responsive tablet that's a joy to use. It's not slow, it's not sluggish(like that Kindle Fire that I'll likely never use again - guess you get what you pay for, huh?) and the battery life is long. Plus down the road, I can get the Apple Pencil which for what I understand is great.

Another thing I like is that unlike with Android tablets(or Android devices in general), you aren't stuck with having nice hardware that the manufacture may update once or twice and move on. You get your updates directly from Apple and there's no waiting to see if Samsung is going to bother giving the 500 dollar tablet you bought the latest version of Android .

I will remain a Windows PC/Android Phone guy, but for tablets, it's iPad or nothing for me now."
B07BTS2KWK,7,69,Battery life. 10 hours? No way,Richard Miller,3,Yes,11-Dec-18,10,1,This battery is short lived. As bad as my old I pad. Maybe lasts 3-4 hours
B07BTS2KWK,7,70,My first ever iPad!!!,Melody,5,Yes,14-Dec-18,6,1,"At first I was unsure if I will buy this expensive tablet, but reading all the reviews online and also with my co-workers recommendation finally, I decided to buy it here in Amazon. I got the best deal as a prime member!!! To date, I used this tablet for personal and work as well. It helps me organize all my notes in one place. No more looking for my written notes somewhere buried in the documents, or perhaps accidentally shredded!!! I have everything in one place!!! The only thing got me concerned (but it has nothing to do with the product itself) was the delivery. I got the item quickly; however, the delivery man knocked at our door and just leave the item there without waiting for me to open and accept the item... I live in an apartment complex and leaving outside the door is not very safe to leave any package at all!!!"
B07BTS2KWK,8,71,Wrong Color,Sarah S.,1,Yes,05-Dec-18,11,3,The color is Rose Gold NOT Gold.
B07BTS2KWK,8,72,A- For its Price,^^,4,Yes,24-Feb-19,4,0,"For Movies :

Huawei MediaPad M5 (around same price) Has Way Better Sound Quality + it has Better Aspect Ratio for Movies (16:10) which means Less Black Bars at top and bottom and + Huawei is with 2560X1600 resolution which translates to even more Crispier picture. another Great and Better alternative compared to iPAD is Galaxy Tab A 10.5 which has same 16:10 aspect Ratio as Huawei M5 but with lesser 1920X1200 resolution and also with much better sound quality compared to ipad 6th.

Reading :

For reading ipad-s 4:3 aspect ratio is Good which means if you are buying Tablet mostly for reading you can buy iPad and it Wont dissapoint :) it is much better compared to Galaxy Tab A 10.5 because for reading majority of people prefers 4:3 aspect ratio compared to 16:10/16:9 + ipad has better resolution compared to Galaxy Tab-s 1920X1200... if we compare iPAD with Huawei M5, ipad has better aspect ratio but Huawei has more Crispier Screen and which ever of those two is more important for you is only up to you.

Performance :

iPAD is Fastest in its price range it Does not means that Huawei is Slow at all but iPAD is clear winner in this category.

Battery : iPAD has Good Battery but to be honest, almost all Tablets are with Decent/Good Batteries these days so it is not anything special to mention anymore.

Camera :

ipad and almost all other Tablets in this price range are equipped only with acceptable cameras, they all lacking, even 4-5 year old high end phone will beat any 250-350$ priced modern tablet, take lets say Galaxy Note 4 and it will outperform this ipad and other similarely priced tablets in camera comparison.

Overall : A-

Overall ipad 6th is Very Good Tablet but not That good as many of people thinks because in same price range +- 50$ you really have comparable and in some ways Better alternatives and yes those alternatives also supporting Pens too ^^ and no, i don't have a chinese wife ;)"
B07BTS2KWK,8,73,deceive consumers,Lynne,1,Yes,15-Feb-19,10,0,This ipad was used by others before and I found history before I bought it!!!!
B07BTS2KWK,8,74,What more can you want?,M. Hernandez,5,Yes,24-Apr-19,3,0,"I'm a long time Apple hater, and I like android, quick and easy, but why then would I buy an iPad after making the previous statement? When it comes to phones, Android has it down, no question. If you're looking for a computer, Windows is the best bet with the most compatibility, functionality, and price (apple products are grossly over priced. I have 15 years as an IT and have built hundreds of PCs with better specs and a fraction of the price), and for Security, you get Linux.

With all that being said, when it comes to tablets, at any price range, Apple makes the best. I've tried windows, and android, but I always find myself going back to it. iPad takes the cake every time. I can't find a fault in this device. It feels well made, with it's solid design, looks good, and has performed flawlessly with every benchmark I've run, and game I've thrown at it.

There are so many choices out there in the tech world and at all price ranges, but when you see an iPad sell for $250 brand new, you buy it. This is the only apple products I will say this about. Hands down, the best tablet I have used in a long time. Get it, you won't be mad at yourself for it. I would dare say you couldn't find a better tablet under $1000 that isn't the iPad pro, which is around $850, and even that can stand up to the $1500 tablets that are on the market now.

The only down side is, if you don't want to be a part of the i-Universe, you don't really have too much of a choice, or do you? Amazon instant video works perfectly, as does Audible, Netflix, library apps, and other streaming apps. So, now, you don't have to be a part of the i-Universe, thankfully. So now, what are you waiting for?"
B07BTS2KWK,8,75,You won't regret it,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,07-Sep-18,8,0,I absolutely love this ipad. I have a youtube channel and video with this. It works great and I use it all the time.
B07BTS2KWK,8,76,Fast delivery and fast device,Darrell Statema,5,Yes,22-Nov-18,8,0,Great value. Very easy to set up. Lightning fast and very high quality.
B07BTS2KWK,8,77,compra no recibida,lyndon,1,Yes,24-Dec-18,7,1,"Este i pad y dos compras más,aparecen como entregadas pero no han sido recibidas en ningún momento,,favor solucionar inconveniente.gracias"
B07BTS2KWK,8,78,"Great products, worth the budget!",Mike,5,Yes,08-Feb-19,4,0,"This is a great tool for all the people who want to increase efficiency and productivity during work and study! You can download any app from the Apple Store, and you can obtain excellent usage experiences which are supported by the most advanced A10 Fusion chip. In addition, the 9.7-inches retina screen enable you gain the most precise color experiences. If you are a student majoring in engineering, you can use WolframAlpha to faster solve problems; if you want to attempt to draw, you can use ProCreate to paint your masterpiece; if you just want to relax during free time, there are thousands of games available in the Game Center.

Functions: As a tablet PC, you can utilize iPad to handle almost all the general projects especially after equipping an Apple pencil. According to Tim Cook’s idea, the advanced technology will replace the paper media in one day, and Apple will be the pioneer during this process. You can write notes, draw sketches, and handle multiple tasks on my screen. In addition, this iPad also inherits all the iPad functions from previous versions.

Durability: I have been using Apple products for over eight years, and I just changed my iPad Air to iPad 2018 this year. However, my previous iPad Air still has perfect conditions and functions and I replaced my iPad due to great budgets during Black Friday. In this way, you can trust the quality stability of the new iPad. In addition, I used iPad to watch two movies for four hours and play games for two hours until ran out of its power after receiving it. You will very satisfy its battery durability since it has longest battery life compared with the Android devices I used before.

Compatibility and Convenience: The iPad is compatible with the software of iPhone, and iPad has its own developed apps version since iPad 2 (eight years ago). In this way, iPad has a mature software supply chain. When I go to class or meet with colleagues, iPad can directly replace my laptops. You can put your iPad inside the women handbags and men briefcases, and you can take it everywhere you want since it only weighed 652 grams, which equal to the weight of two oranges!

In conclusions, the iPad 2018 is a mature product that combinates virtues and improves defects of previous generations. Even though many people comment that the iPad 2018 does not excess iPad Pro, the price of the iPad 2018 is only half of the prices for that of the iPad Pro. It will be the best workmate with great budgets, and you will find that it worth every penny you spend on it!"
B07BTS2KWK,8,79,Replaced my MacBook Pro with a 9.7” iPad 2018 model (see review for full details),Old Kook Skater,5,Yes,17-Apr-19,2,2,"Like all Apple products I’ve ever owned / used - it just works. I am currently using my iPad in an experiment in portable computing. I work in finance and couldn’t justify the cost of an iPad Pro, nor did I need that level of graphics power. Instead (and always enjoy a challenge) I opted to get the least expensive iPad (2018) with 32GB Ram. I knew I needed only a few apps - primarily word, excel, Microsoft One Drive for iOS and Google Drive. What I have up and running and with using less than 10 of the 32 GB of storage:

Microsoft One Drive
Google Drive (temporary - migrating from Google to One Drive, so necessary at this time)
Safari - native iOS app performs beautifully on my company’s web-based platform
Microsoft Word - needs office 365 account for maximum benefit
Microsoft Excel - needs office 365 account for maximum benefit
Host of other apps - native and third party (like the Amazon App) but not any games, and I don’t store any music, podcasts, movies, or other storage-intensive media.

I have used Google Chrome for iOS and it works well, but I prefer the user interface of Safari, so I stuck with that. On iPad, either browser works well and I can see benefits for one over the other and vice-versa, but for my purposes, Safari is fine.

I have my iPad connected via Bluetooth to a portable keyboard that I also acquired on Amazon’s website, which makes this work more like a notebook computer overall. I also have a stylus from Amazon that works beautifully since I don’t have a mouse, and I’m not sure I could use one now anyway... when using (now my daughter’s) MacBook Pro, I find myself reaching for the screen to navigate by touch (d’oh!).

I have the iPad sync’d to my iPhone for messages and for calls - WiFi calling and calls on my iPhone. Calls are clear, iMessage works great - for iOS and texts forwarded from non-iOS devices. I have my iPhone set up for a WiFi Hotspot when needed.

The only thing I “miss” is not having my music and media stored locally. I have this partially addressed by having most of my music in the cloud and music plus all other media stored on an external hard drive that I access through a portable router.

Benefits - this weighs less than half what my MacBook Pro weighed, and travel is much easier. Still have to remove the iPad for TSA when going through security, but it’s so much lighter. This has actually been a Godsend of late; my wife had an accident and broke her ankle. I’ve been driving her to appointments for work since I can work remotely, and once again, the iPad is amazing. Paired with my keyboard and iPhone HotSpot and it’s like I’m in the office, only much more convenient.

It’s faster than my desktop PC and faster than my former MacBook Pro. Hard as it may be to believe, the iPad feels like it was made to access Google drive and Microsoft One Drive, and I can access files nearly 3x faster than my desktop PC when connected to the same internet. In fact, the iPad is on WiFi and the desktop is wired, and the iPad wins.

I can do all my work in the scaled-down iOS apps, or I can use Office.com and log in through Safari and access One Drive and Word and Excel online. There are a couple of features not available in the scaled down iOS versions but they’re not significant enough to deter me from doing all my work on the iPad when necessary.

Intuitive controls - gestures and swipes work as they do on a MacBook Pro touchpad. This made the transition way easier.

Inexpensive Accessories - Amazon has a host of accessories that work brilliantly with the iPad and have made this transition entirely possible and within a very tight budget.

Drawbacks: Charger cable is kind of short. I can buy a third party cable, but I like the way the Apple OE cable performs. I work around it and use the battery and although the cable is short, the battery does last all day for WORK. Streaming Hulu when I should be working? Not so much.

Learning Curve: It does take some getting-used to when ditching a Magic Mouse or touch-pad. Allegedly, a future update will give iPad the capability of communicating with a Magic Mouse 2, but I’m not in a hurry to get a mouse.

Not having media on-hand all the time. It’s more of an inconvenience than a drawback."
B07BTS2KWK,8,80,Great pictures,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,23-Oct-18,6,0,"This is a good product. I only bought it to use with my Mavic Drone so i would have a bigger screen to see what the heck i am doing when flying, rather than using the small screen of a phone. But the more I played with it, I like it. I can facetime with relatives that are Apple people, message and much more. Very satisfied with the purchase. I also bought the keyboard that goes with it, very nice too."
B07BTS2KWK,9,81,Could be I have been mistaken about IOS for all these years?,Skipper McFearson,5,Yes,29-Jan-19,2,0,"This is my very first sojourn into IOS / Apple products. Why is everything so much smoother with the IPad than it was with my high end android tablet? (rhetorical) After using this for only one day, I can say without reservation that the ease of use and intuitive nature of the apple product is 100 percent better than the android with only one exception...and that is Apps. I am not even close to exploring all the Apple app store has but I can say that trying to find the apps that I liked and was used to in android is not as easy as I thought. I suppose it is simply a matter of thinking about what I need differently because I am pretty sure they exist. After only 3 hours of use, the best words I can use to describe this Ipad in relation to my android tablet is easy, intuitive, seamless, and beautiful. The wifi connection is ridiculously fast as is all processing functions. The integration of user-friendly functionality is amazing. The display is heads and shoulders above the android in every way. I still have a lot to learn but for those thinking about making the switch, I would strongly encourage you to at least try it. I still refuse to fork over $1000 for an IOS phone though. That's were I draw the line."
B07BTS2KWK,9,82,Android fans - Give this a test drive!,Edward M. Levinson,5,Yes,26-Mar-19,3,0,"This was my first Apple device. Long time Android fan and, for the last 5 years, a Samsung fan. Last 2 phones have been the Note 5 and now Note 8. Love them both. Researched tabs and tried and compared the iPad with a Galaxy Tab S3 (used) because I wanted a device for photo editing primarily. IPad pro was too expensive as was Tab S4. Hence the choices. S3 was at the time $50 more.

Chose the ipad. Surprised the hell out of me. I thought the Apple ecosystem would be enough to sway me away. It didn't. It was an easy adjustment and I enjoy using it. Aside from the screen and expandable storage (which I did not need) the ipad was better in every way. Quicker and more responsive. When I do speed tests comparing my Note 8 and the ipad, the ipad never loses (though they tie alot). Wish the iPad had the AMOLED screen of the S3 (the blacks are to die for) but it is still very good.

I eventually returned the S3, and got an iPad for under $200 which I think is a great deal given the performance. I use the ipad side by side with my Note 8 and enjoy them equally. Not sure I would make a move to an iPhone because the Samsung phones seem to offer more for the money, and I love my Note 8. But if you are an Android fan looking for a tablet, don't let the Apple ecosystem deter you from giving the ipad a test drive.

FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN PHOTO EDITING: When I did my extensive research on tab devices for photo editing, of course the iPad Pro, Tab S3 and S4, and Surface Pro were all highly recommended, though at least one article recommended the basic ipad as well. The Pro in particular is lauded for the color accuracy of its screen, faster processor, and greater storage capacity. Many reviewers suggested going with the Tab S3 or 4 if in the android universe and the iPad Pro if in the apple universe. I also read that I would be unable to do things with photos in the Apple ecosystem that I could do in the Android ecosystem. For example, with my Note 8, I plug an sd card in a USB device, plug it in to the phone, and access and manipulate photos. I read I would not be able to do this with the iPad without buying an apple specific device (apple lightning cable/adapter). That is not true. In fact, when I plugged my USB device with SD card inserted into the iPad (yes, this device has multiple input plugs and one fits the IPAD; it cost me about $8), the iPad prompted me to go to the Apple store and download an app (iUSB pro) so that I could use it!!! Boy, was I impressed. Never expected it to work and almost never tried it. And, had the iPad not prompted me to download the app, I probably would have assumed the device could not be used as I had read. So, I am able to use the iPad exactly the same way I had been using my Note 8 for photo editing. I access photos via SD card as described or via Google Photos (which I downloaded from the Apple store), send the photo to Snapseed or Photo Express (which I also downloaded; both work fine on the iPad) for editing, and then save the photo and send it to my Epson printer for printing (via the Epson print app, which also works fine on the iPad).

So again, if you are an Android fan looking for an inexpensive tab for photo editing, give the iPad a test drive. I'd prefer to have the iPad Pro of course, but not for an extra $500. It beats the hell out of editing photos on my phone while sitting on the sofa, that's for sure! . And you can get a great deal on a gently used one on Amazon."
B07BTS2KWK,9,83,Works well and fast,Bing Yang,5,Yes,03-Dec-18,6,0,"I have a 10 inch Amazon Fire tablet for a year. It was very good for watching video and consume media. It was slow in browsing or other apps. This iPad beats it by a mile in both speed and functionality. At $250 during Black Friday, I see no reason not to buy one."
B07BTS2KWK,9,84,Brand new iPad.,Tiffani,5,Yes,14-Mar-19,2,1,"After reading reviews I took the plunge and bought this iPad. Over the last couple years I have switched from android to apple products first with a phone, then a watch, now the ipad. I was hesitant due to the overwhelming # of reviews that claimed this iPad was used or refurbished. I purchased the 128gb model in gold. I will start by saying it came perfectly packed and arrived on time. Box was brand new in shrink wrap. Upon opening I did a complete inspection. Not a single mark. It’s brand new. Set up was a breeze. Transferring everything from phone to iPad was so easy. The screen quality is amazing. I purchased to help with my ale-vel thrive marketing and it runs their app seamlessly. It’s fast. Faster than even my i7 processor laptop. Battery life is great. 85% out of the box. Used it consistently for web surfing and watching TV for 2 days and battery life down to 20. Charged fast. Charged up to 90% then watched a movie. Only down to 82% now. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase."
B07BTS2KWK,9,85,Love the iPad!,Bjshopper,5,Yes,08-Nov-18,7,0,"I love this iPad! My other iPad was six years old and decided to put the ‘activation lock’ on and without my original receipt Apple would not unlock it! I referred to that as Apple obsolescence. Apple’s way of making you purchase a new device. This be is very fast, similiar to my old one but more efficient. Shipping time was less than stated and the package arrived undamaged."
B07BTS2KWK,9,86,Silver Apple iPad (latest version),Prime user,5,Yes,16-Jan-19,2,1,"I wish I could say my opinion was influenced by all the Apple stock I own but I don’t gamble with the stock market. I’ve used Apple products for years and am always 100% pleased with their products and their ( best in world, customer support). This iPad is nothing shy of the great performance I expected from Apple. It’s fast, it’s clear, it’s well made and it wasn’t expensive at all. 25 years ago when I bought my first Mac, I was amazed with the operating system while at the same time I was trouble shooting a brand new Dell xps that cost $5,000 dollars. A simple virus forced me to F dish and reinstall the Windows. Pretty much a 12 hour job after reinstalling drivers and update reboots. There was no short cuts with Windows that actually worked. Needless to say, Apple won be over and from that point on I alway say “ Once you go Mac you never go back”.

I got off track, sorry.......this iPad is the best and it lives up to the great performance that Apple is known for."
B07BTS2KWK,9,87,Very pleased,Blue,5,Yes,16-Oct-18,9,0,Loved this. All expectations met. Price is perfect. Recommend this very much.
B07BTS2KWK,9,88,Perfect size for taking notes,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,14-Dec-18,4,0,"I needed something small to take notes at college because I found taking my laptop every single day was cumbersome since I only used it to take it for notes. It's finals right now, but the battery life is enough to last for my classes and even facetime my friends during my break. I wish I had bought it sooner. It's super convenient. The only problem is when connecting to my Bluetooth keyboard sometimes letters get cut out, but that seems to stem from the keyboard. Love it!"
B07BTS2KWK,9,89,Don’t use amazon,H,1,Yes,29-Dec-18,8,0,Product did not fit did not work 3 weeks still no refund do not use
B07BTS2KWK,9,90,"Too much glare, bluetooth lag",David Wright,2,Yes,02-Apr-19,2,0,"The excessive glare means that the wonderful higher resolution is useless and self-defeating, which is really the main reason to buy this over the other tablets. The high contrast also makes things difficult to read as well.

And also, the bluetooth lag is really inexcusable. This did get better after the upgrade.

Non-deal killers:
1) Apps such as youtube and Netflix won't even use the higher resolution most of the time.
2) Apple pay accounts, passwords, itunes everywhere, cloud backup, credit card is required to use store.
3) Apple apps like Apple books looks better, has better fonts than Amazon Kindle. Youtube didn't even do 1080p until a recent upgrade. It's a bit annoying not to use the full Apple experience, but I suppose it can be done."
B07BTS2KWK,10,91,AWESOME,Joann R. Greene,5,Yes,22-Aug-18,6,0,This is a wonderful device -especially for younger folks. I'm a tad older and have some difficulty with it but I'm sure younger folks would really dig it.
B07BTS2KWK,10,92,Love it!!!,PAT,5,Yes,30-Jan-19,2,0,"I was not specifically looking for an iPad, but this more than meets my needs. It is a rose-gold with white keys - very pretty. The color is amazing, the screen resolution is very clear. I did not want this for work purposes, so got with wi-fi only. I downloaded all the apps that were in addition to what synced with my iPhone. I ordered a keypad cover separately, and did sign up with Apple for the additional AppleCare coverage. It is more expensive than i could purchase at a Best Buy and a few other stores, but to be honest, I was given a gift card that covered the cost. that too impacted my decision to go with the iPad! It is the newest version as well - totally what is identified. It was deliverred quickly and well-packaged."
B07BTS2KWK,10,93,Love my iPad,VillageTam,5,Yes,09-Apr-19,3,0,"Haven't had it very long, so perhaps it's not a good time to write a review. I had an iPad mini before. Wanted something with more storage and a bigger screen. So far, it works great. A bit harder to handle because I got used to my mini, but I'm sure I won't any issues after a while. It's lightweight and I love the rose gold color. Haven't tried printing from it yet, but shouldn't be a problem. Don't hesitate about getting one."
B07BTS2KWK,10,94,Pretty good,Nija,4,Yes,14-Jan-19,2,0,"I bought this iPad for Christmas to replace my big, bulky laptop. I’m no tech person, just a regular college student and it gets the job done. Since I’m on break, I haven’t done any schoolwork on it yet. I have done some internet browsing on multiple tabs, worked on two apps at the same time, and mainly stream videos and it works very well. If I had to say anything negative, it would be the “air gap”. Let me just start off by saying that I didn’t even know what an air gap was until I watched review videos for this iPad. I really wish that I didn’t watch the review videos because the air gap is the only thing I see when watching videos and it’s soooo noticeable. So if you don’t know what an air gap is, don’t worry about it. Overall, great, affordable iPad."
B07BTS2KWK,10,95,Addicted to apple,Niffer,5,Yes,10-Feb-19,2,0,"Yep it’s the real deal alright. A friend got me the apple x for Christmas and so I decided to get the iPad to go with it... and I have never been so impressed with anything ever. I’ve never used apple products. Mostly midrange android phones. I’m basically a unicorn in the way I’m in my twenties and don’t use social media, so I’m like “why the hell would anyone spend that kind of money on a phone?” Welllllllllll now I know why. Cuz they are freaking awesome. The iPad pairs to my phone and I got the pencil with it and I draw allll the time ad nd design tattoos so this thing is so great. Just take it with me and when inspo strikes I can pull out the iPad! Love it and I’m afraid now that I will not be able to live without my iPad and iPhone combo... they got a customer for life."
B07BTS2KWK,10,96,Android User finds Ipad awkward to hold and use.,G. Gray,4,Yes,04-Jan-19,1,0,"I got a tremendous deal on the iPad. It is okay.

I have been using a Samsung S2 9.7"". I am not a big app user. I primarily use a tablet almost exclusively for browsing and content consumption. I love the Samsung Tab. The OLED display and its thinness make it a joy to use for hours at a time. Downside to Samsung is the lack of OS updates and a fussy fingerprint detector. I would have bought a Tab S4 10.5"" but I did not want to spend that amount of money and be out of OS support in only 2 years.

I bought the IPad around Christmas for $179.99 after promotions here on Amazon. My wife has a 2016 iPad Air 2 ,so I was not unfamiliar with IOS and iPads. Here is my take:
The iPad is thick and heavy. IOS is bulky and bloated compared to Android and it requires one to navigate in a fairly constrained way. It just lacks Android flexibility. The retina display is ok, can't compare to the 3 years old Samsung OLED.

On the plus side, the Apple finger print sensor is excellent. Apple has updated the OS several times already.

I use Outlook app as my primary email client, the Android version is nicer. I also use Robinhood. The Android version is much easier to look at on Android.. Other than that Chrome is pretty much Chrome except the IOS version has less flexibility in text sizes.

The biggest plus for iPad was the low price and knowing the OS will be current for several years which means a very low cost of ownership."
B07BTS2KWK,10,97,Loving my new iPad,Diego,5,Yes,20-Apr-19,1,1,"This is my second iPad. I had a 2nd generation one that by now has slowed to a crawl.
Using this iPad reminds me of how fast my old one felt when I originally got it. Things again load fast, Garage Band works as expected, videos play without hiccups, and on top of that, it works with the Apple Pencil.

I paid $329 for the 128Gb version, which was a great deal. I guess it was discounted because Apple was about to release the new iPad Air. I cannot justify paying the higher price of the other models when this one is the right size and does everything I want. Unless you have some really good reason for choosing the more expensive Pro models, the iPad 9.7 128 and the Apple Pencil are a winning combination at a reasonable price.

I bought the iPad, the Pencil and a keyboard cover (from Logitech). After using it for a couple of weeks, I decided that the cover took away most of the pleasure of the iPad, turning it into a heavy laptop that cannot be used to comfortably read a book or even draw pictures. I returned the cover and instead went with a simple cheap cover that includes a pencil holder. Unless typing is very important to you, this seems to be a much better combination for me."
B07BTS2KWK,10,98,Not User Friendly,Amazon Customer,3,Yes,30-Apr-19,1,0,"Nice size, crisp screen and that's where it ends. Doesn't pick up the Wi-Fi signal as well as our other devices, in the same exact spots. Wind up canceling as it takes forever to load basic apps like Amazon or Yahoo. So I've ordered an Ethernet adapter. This is where the disappointments begin. No headphone jack/USB port. 3 in 1 adapter has horrible reviews regardless of the brand. Why invest in headphones if adapter is unreliable and short lived? Another feature disappointment is lack of Swype keyboard...this is a no brainer, even my old android phone has a Swype option. I added a Swype APP, followed the instructions and the globe but was not compatible. Bottom line...I have an iPad but it lacks many of the features that make my technical life convenient, necessary and fun. What's not fun is having to enter 6 digit ID codes and finger print ID multiple times at one sitting. It's not like I'm not expecting a home invasion in between Google searches. Signing in every time I pick up the iPad is simply overkill and frustrating. Sorry Apple, you did not impress."
B07BTS2KWK,10,99,Not very impressive,GrimPhobos,2,Yes,29-Jan-19,4,0,"The specs and performance on it are barely better than my wife's 3 year old I-Pad Air, and there is less storage on it. It looks like you are pretty much down to paying way too much for the I-Pad pro, or just buying an old I-Pad Air. Not worth the money."
B07BTS2KWK,10,100,Great price. Easy setup. Super fast.,Kathee,5,Yes,22-Feb-19,2,0,"Wow, I had an iPad2 for years and it was so slow that it was driving me crazy. I checked out new iPads on amazon and was impressed with the price. I’m so happy I got one. It was easy to set up. Transferred all my apps by signing in to iTunes and in about an hour I was signed in to all my apps and my mail and started using it. It is super fast compared to older one. Apps that kept crashing or freezing on old iPad are super fast. The battery life is great. Also, it is much lighter that old one. Great resolution . I got the Smart Cover because that’s what I had for my old one. Everything is perfect in my opinion."
B07BTS2KWK,11,101,Superb in every way,Grateful Mommy??,5,Yes,11-Mar-19,1,0,"I bought this as a learning tool for my little ones. Got it at an amazing price and it was worth every penny I spent on it plus more! The quality of Apple products is just unmatched, seriously! I have zero concerns about the quality of this iPad. The screen is amazing, if feels solid, and the platform is like no other! Honestly, if you’re a fan, then you likely don’t even read reviews about them but if you’re on the fence, just know there is nothing to hesitate about. I heard people talk negatively for years about the iPhone, and I let it convince me that I was an Android used for life.. but I just had to have one and finally gave in and I will never look back! Same with the iPad. I would rather spend a little more, and it’s not much these days, and know that it’s going to last. Something I’ve been learning lately is.. buy the quality item the first time, take good care of it, and you’ll save yourself a whole lot of money and time in the end. Don’t just purchase something because it’s on clearance or because it’s a lower price than the item you really want. Invest your money wisely. Yes, I said invest!"
B07BTS2KWK,11,102,Great tablet,Kevin Johnson,5,Yes,25-Apr-19,1,0,"I have used an iPhone for years but never an iPad - opting instead for Android tablets. When the price got under $250 for this iPad I decided it was worth the try. I am very glad I did. Having an iPhone made the transition easy as all of my apps and info transferred via the cloud. It is so nice to be able to back and forth between devices and have all photos and files accessible on both devices. The iPad itself is just about the perfect size and the processor is very quick. Boot up time is short and apps open quickly. I do not have anything to compare the battery time to but it seems to discharge at a similar rate to my older Google Nexus 7 and Amazon Fire 8 tablets. The included charger is fine, but I did pick up a quick charger and the battery does recharge very quickly. Screen resolution is more than adequate. Overall, I feel like this is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time."
B07BTS2KWK,11,103,Good affordable iPad.,Bruce,4,Yes,17-Mar-19,2,0,"Was affordable too purchase for $250. Fast, smooth and easy to use. Screen quality is good when displaying video, pictures and browsing web. Battery life is ok. It depends on how you use the tablet. If you barely used it then battery life is good but it if use extensively then battery life is not good. I was video chatting with my mom for like 30mins or 1 hour and battery drain fast. I watch videos for 3 hours and battery drains slowly. It depends on how you use it. This is good for those who want to browse the net, play games, watch videos or video chat. Good for kids to use as well."
B07BTS2KWK,11,104,The Amazon tech was much more helpful than the Apple tech they turned me over to.,Barbara H.,2,Yes,09-Dec-18,6,0,This iPad has acted weird from the get-go. I should have returned it. Loved my first iPad Mini.
B07BTS2KWK,11,105,Got to Replace iPad Mini 4,Kurt A. Wetzel,5,Yes,27-Mar-19,1,0,"I got a used one for $220. Certified and tested by Amazon with a warranty if defective. A little skeptical but not anymore. Sure a few marks/scratches here and there but I can't notice any. Came with original box, manual, and all accessories (aftermarket not sure but they work).
I use it to watch YouTube videos, listen to music, play games such as Candy Crush Soda, check email, and browse the web. It works super fast like brand new. Great picture with the Retina display. Factory speakers are good quality. Sound gets pretty loud without turning all the way up. Only flaw is 2 speakers on one side and none on the other. Would be better with one speaker on each side.
The other small problem is no anti-reflective coating on the screen.
Very satisfied and I recommend it for those who want a affordable basic tablet."
B07BTS2KWK,11,106,Very pleased,robert miner,5,Yes,18-Mar-19,2,1,"I know Apple is coming out with a new iPad in the next few weeks. I was going on vacation and wanted something sooner than later. The price on this older model is still worth it. The price on this will probably drop in the next couple weeks. If you can wait, then wait and get at a better price, but if you cant you will not be disappointed. The processing speed is great, touchscreen is very responsive and screen is crystal clear. I added a T-mobile sim for the cellular. Did not have any issues with connectivity on the cellular."
B07BTS2KWK,11,107,"Will not disappoint, affordable and awesome",Kyle3366,5,Yes,15-Mar-19,2,0,"I am really happy with my purchase. I was upgrading from the Ipad Air2. Super affordable, I got 128GB, amazing difference in the quality of the screen, the color display and brightness. Camera is ok, but I was way more interested in this for entertainment, web surfing and day to day computer tasks. Speed was faster for sure, but was less impressive or noticeable than some of the other features. I was a bit hesitant because I did not know what was reasonable to expect.
The price and the quality are great. No issues as of yet, easy set up. I use this instead of a laptop, it is an awesome device all around."
B07BTS2KWK,11,108,"Late to the iPad game, but loving it!",Victoria,5,Yes,09-Apr-19,1,0,"I've been a desktop user for many, many years, and have not seen the need to go the tablet route until recently. I wanted something I could use in my kitchen to keep my recipes in, and then just prop it up instead of having to print out recipes all the time. I found the perfect app, installed it, and now I have my recipes at my fingertips. Perfect!

Obviously, there are many other uses (social media, digital art, streaming tv/movies, office/contact/calendar uses, etc., and I am still digging into all of those.

So far, I am very happy with my iPad! It was a good price, and came in perfect condition. The battery life is great, too. I have been very impressed with that aspect of it as well. I would definitely recommend it!"
B07BTS2KWK,11,109,Powerful and fun too!,??Eugene,5,Yes,02-Dec-18,1,0,"I've purchased a number of Apple products on Amazon, where I prefer to buy them, including two iMacs and several others. This must be my seventh iPad from Amazon, and I found it to be the most agreeable way to get them. I got two of this item.

* A10 Fusion chip is just incredible. My kids receiving these iPads already put this to use with their online games. Some of those games are graphics intensive, and they're multiplayer games. They are on FaceTime with their friends while playing, using up the batteries faster than I would.
* It works with the pen, and I'll probably get them on Amazon too.
* This is a multitaskers dream iPad. My kids have their friends on FaceTime while using several applications.
* Works well with augmented reality applications (AR). This is one of the most powerful learning methods I've witnessed."
B07BTS2KWK,11,110,Awesome iPad,scottfin,5,Yes,28-Jan-19,1,0,"I bought this, because I""m a musician, and I use Garageband a lot to write music. This iPad performs outstandingly well. I can put lots of vocal tracks and many many instruments to create a rough idea of my song ideas. Just using the built in mic for singing performs amazingly well, and there are many cool settings like in a regular DAW for processing vocals. I love being able to export in Wave format. I actually do all the harmonies and main vocals in the iPad and export them into Cubase, so I can remember the harmonies.

I love how fast and responsive this iPad is. I had been using my iPad 3, but this is blazingly fast. I love the fingerprint lock as well. For the price, this is a steal. I wish I had known they aren't $800 dollars anymore, because I would have bought this a long time ago.

The only negative I found is the battery life is not as good as my iPad 3, but considering the processing power, it's a fine trade off. ."
B07BTS2KWK,12,111,Amazon Warehouse Deal (Great!),Small Forest,5,Yes,05-Mar-19,1,0,"I've had good experiences and bad experiences with Amazon Warehouse Deals but this is looking like a good experience, especially for the price I paid. The item description said the iPad would have minor scuffs and/or scratches but it didn't. It is perfect. NO blemishes whatsoever. The box is a tiny bit ""wrinkled"" in one very small area (you have to hold it to the light just right to see it) and there was a smudge of black grease or rubber on the white Apple box in the wrinkled area (can't tell if it's grease or rubber but it won't come off but hard to see either way). My guess is the box got caught in a jam on a conveyor and the belt rubbed the box a bit. No harm done and no damage to the iPad so I got a perfect iPad for a great price. Winner!"
B07BTS2KWK,12,112,Expedient delivery. Well packaged,alisabellos,5,Yes,02-Jan-19,-,0,"I have an Ipad Air2 that my grandson's have grown quite attached to so I was looking for another one for myself. I found this one equally as easy to handle and the larger screen a lot easier on my eyes for reading from my kindle app. The true tone display is more vivid, true to life and engaging. The Screen is definitely fingerprint-resistant, my 4yr old grandson was using it and he ALWAYS leaves the screen on the Air pad full of prints. I like that it comes with a fully laminated/Anti-reflective coated display. With its 4 stereo speakers I can listen to amped up music, BONUS! Doodle away with the Apple Pencil and seamlessly attach a keyboard without fumbling with Bluetooth. I read up on how ""the iPad Pro 9.7 strikes out on its own with a few advancements. It was the first to tout True Tone display technology that adapts to your environment by subtly adjusting the white balance, and there's a much wider color gamut behind its anti-reflective coated glass. Its camera is 12MP and shoots 4K video, taking cues from the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus cameras. While the new iPhone XS and iPad Pro 11 have better cameras, the iPad Pro 9.7 still has the snappers on most slates beat, and with the option for 256GB of storage it's got more space too"". So far it's been accurate on all accounts. Before buying new Computer products, whether online or in-store, I do a lot or research and read all the reviews, or most of them so I know if I've found the right product, at the right price, from the best retailer and one that delivers the best features and from a reputable brand. So, among the research I also receive I-tech emails and out of the 21243 products in the Computers category, on a scale from 1-10; stating their review scores were developed using a range of data sources, from customer reviews, price comparisons and expert reviews, all collated in order to give a good as possible indication on whether the iPad pro 9.7 is right for you, they gave it a 9.6 on Price, 9.4 on Quality, a 9.6 on Features and an Overall 9.5 I hope this helps..."
B07BTS2KWK,12,113,Big improvement over ipad air 2013,Ken S,5,Yes,26-Mar-19,-,0,"Our 2013 ipad air saw daily use as my wife's tablet, for all the functions expected from a tablet. Not like a laptop, but just what she needed for bill paying, emails, social networks, shopping, information finding, etc. The 16gb was just barely enough storage, but worked. Suddenly, it would not charge. Never from the battery chargers we have been using, and only sometimes from our various AC charging ports. Two days of that and we decided a replacement was needed.

The 6th gen ipad (not an ""air"") was at least $100 cheaper than than the air, has 32gb storage, and processing time is much faster, milliseconds instead of seconds. The new one paired with the old one by bluetooth, and transferred all data. The 6th gen does everything the 2013 did, and more.

For myself, I choose PC/android. I have bought many kindles for myself and our grandkids. A few months before my wife retired I bought her the Apple after hours and hours of research, over weeks and weeks. It was not a decision I made lightly. It was a surprise Christmas present, she did not approve, thinking she did not ""need"" it. She did start to use it, and in a few weeks I was forgiven. I was not totally vindicated until she retired, and had time to use it.

Our phones are android, my next laptop will be PC, I am no hard core Apple fan, but we love this ipad for $249. It suits my wife perfectly."
B07BTS2KWK,12,114,The best entry-level tablet you can get!,Danny B,5,Yes,17-Apr-19,1,1,"The iPad is one of the best tablets you can get. This is Apple's ""low-end"" tablet, so it doesn't have quite the features or performance of the iPad Pro or the Air, but what you do get is a great tablet for casual use. I've been an Android tablet user since 2013, and I have to say, the App Store has a lot more apps that are actually designed to be used on a tablet. Unlike the Fire or Android tablets, the iPad is not just a content consumption device. It comes with iMovie, GarageBand, Pages (word processor), Numbers (spreadsheet), and Keynote (presentation), and it supports the Apple Pencil. The speakers are decent as well. I highly recommend picking one up unless you need the power of the Air or Pro."
B07BTS2KWK,12,115,So GOOD for so LITTLE,David,5,Yes,17-Apr-19,-,0,"For the money the value with this device is unheard of in Apple products. It’s plenty fast for all but the most intensive tasks. The screen looks great. Saying the pro has a better screen is sort of like saying a Lamborghini is faster than a corvette. Maybe it’s true but in typical use you won’t really be able to tell unless they’re side by side. I use my Ipad extensively to read comic books and the colors look great.

The iPad Pro is no doubt an incredibly impressive machine but this is the one you should buy. Now it even supports the Apple Pencil (gen 1) so the only difference is really the smart connection (you don't need it. Plenty of alternative keyboards that work very well) the screen (you won’t be complaining about this one) and the power. (You likely won't even challenge this iPad so having way more power in a pro won't help most people)

For less than half the price of an iPad Pro this is a tremendous value. If you're the kind of person that truly needs a pro then you won't read my review to figure that out. You'll already know. So if you're reading this on the fence go ahead and get the base iPad. It's a terrific device and you won't regret it."
B07BTS2KWK,12,116,9.7” iPad (2018 model),S. Winn,5,Yes,09-Mar-19,-,0,"This is my first tablet and so far am enjoying the convience it provides. To be able to do different things without being tied down to my desk top computer is great. The size and weight also makes it so much better to use than a bulkier lap top computer. I purchased a case that has a built in keyboard that can flip completely out of the way when not needed. This gives me the ability to actually use this as a laptop when required (maybe 20% of time (or less)) or as the tablet. If you have an iPhone then you will have no problem doing anything you want on this iPad. Once you sync the 2 together everything is always transferred back and forth between them. I did not get an iPad that is 4g (tied with my cell phone carrier) but I am still able to send and receive text messages and face time with my contacts (as long as I am connected to WiFi). Battery life does not seem to last as long as the iPhone battery and when you need to charge the iPad battery, plan ahead to be able to do it over night. The iPad battery does not charge fast (like the phone does)."
B07BTS2KWK,12,117,"For the price, it’s an unbeatable product",BIK,5,Yes,30-Jan-19,2,0,"I love this iPad. It’s completey changed my school study habits as I can download all of my textbooks and class work on there. The battery life is fantastic and can last for days without charging. The screen colors and display are super vivid and bright. The speaker is also surprisingly loud and might be as loud if not louder than my MacBook. For the price, it’s an unbeatable product."
B07BTS2KWK,12,118,Quality product good price,Kim E. Ferraro,5,Yes,15-Mar-19,1,0,"What can I say? It’s an iPad. It works like you would expect an Apple product to work. The best surprise was that it has a 3.5mm headphone jack, which I thought had been eliminated. So I can continue to use my older Bose QC15 headphones that would have cost more to replace than the iPad/keyboard combo I bought. If you are buying a new iPad, you 100% need to also buy the Sterlibox brand BT keyboard/case, it will make your enjoyment and usability of the iPad twice what you have ever had before. Kudos to Apple for finally setting an iPad price where it should be."
B07BTS2KWK,12,119,"Updated. Customer support, more myth than legend!",NoThanx,4,Yes,18-Apr-19,-,1,"UPDATE
The same day I posted the initial review, I also sent a follow up email to Sparin customer service. I received a response later that night. From that point forward customer service has been exemplary. The rep apologized for not responding to my initial contact, stating that my initial inquiry inadvertently was either overlooked or somehow fell through the cracks. They immediately sent a replacement unit and didn’t ask me to return the original purchase (which is good, as it was already trashed out of frustration). The rep also offered installation advice and followed up several times to make certain the install turned out well, it did. So overall, a good product, and once you get their attention, terrific customer service.

Why only four stars? Because a perfect installation is still a crapshoot. I achieved an acceptable, but imperfect result in attempt 3. I’m a little OCD. For a perfectionist, I believe a negative pressure clean room would be required to get desired results. It’s a big piece of glass, so the installation is exponentially trickier that on a smart phone, but that’s not the product’s fault.

——————————

This seems to be a reasonably good product. My bigger issue is with the manufacturer. Installation proved to be more difficult than I had anticipated. I watched the video and followed all instructions but my first attempt resulted in a couple larger bubbles that would not come out. I probably got impatient at that point and should have let the screen sit for a day, but the bubbles seemed to large to settle in. So as it was a two pack, I ripped the first one off and tried again.

Second attempt was worse. A dust speck under the screen resulted in a 2 inch bubble. Disaster. One of the reasons I bought this product was a review by another purchaser who also had installation difficulties. She remarked that after she left an underwhelming review, Sparin reached out to her directly with assistance. I thought that was great, so rather than post a negative review, I thought I would contact Sparin directly on their web site. Two weeks an no response. I guess public shaming is more effective. Where is your customer support, Sparin? I’m waiting with an unprotected screen."
B07BTS2KWK,12,120,Wonderful in many ways...,Tijoli,5,Yes,10-Jan-19,1,0,"Love it! I couldn't believe this was the latest model for the price I paid but it really is! I'm just getting to know how to use the apple apps as I've been a long time android user. Its very easy to work with (changing from app to app, portability, etc.) I have small hands but can still hold it with both and text with my thumbs which is so much faster than using my index finger. The battery seems to last forever but I'm not a heavy user. I can read all evening and search the net and still have enough battery for another night or two. This was a 50th birthday gift and it makes being over the hill worth it!!"
B07BTS2KWK,13,121,"Sleeker, Slimmer than previos iPad",D. West,5,Yes,25-Apr-19,-,0,"I got this version of iPad as the outdated iOS from generation 3 cannot support some of the web pages/video streams I needed for lecture series. There are also entertainment sites that don't support old iOS, either, so the time was right for the upgrade. Screen size is the same as my older model, but the frame of the digitizer is narrower, and the overall iPad appears thinner than the 3rd gen.So I end up with a sleeker design, yet no loss in screen size. And the processor power and image quality is even better than early iPads, so all in all, an excellent choice. I did not need a unit with cell capability, so the wi-fi version is quite sufficient.

I gave 4 stars for battery as the unit is brand new, and I don't know how long the battery life is yet. I know that it was always very strong in the 3rd gen, so expect good battery life in the new model as well.

Definitely a good iPad choice for the price."
B07BTS2KWK,13,122,"Perfect brand new tablet, great price, just as good as the more expensive ones I've checked out.",Ashley,5,Yes,02-Mar-19,2,0,"Came in brand new unwrapped apple box neatly packaged with cord and wall plug. I needed it for gaming. I usually always go with android, but for some reason android tablets are so slow with what I play, and apple is quite fast. Picture quality and speed are great. My daughter has an iPad air2, and refurbished ones are more expensive than this, and I cannot tell a difference except mine is actually a little faster, and a newer year model. I'd definitely recommend. It's highly rated for a reason, and I read a lot of reviews and searched a ton of different versions before making my decision. I don't regret it at all. I have a galaxy Samsung tablet that I paid more for a couple years ago, and I wish I had bought one of these in the first place."
B07BTS2KWK,13,123,Arrived earlier than expected,Bella,5,Yes,28-Dec-18,2,0,"I love this iPad! I’m not using it for anything fancy, just to shop and look up things in the internet when I want a bigger screen than what my iPhone offers.

If you can use an iPhone you can use an iPad as it’s platform is identical. I’m even more excited that I caught it on sale for $229 and that it arrived Thursday instead of Monday when it was apparently on back order"
B07BTS2KWK,13,124,"Quick ship, great product!",Haley,5,Yes,10-Feb-19,2,0,"I ordered this at like 9:30 on a Saturday night and it got here the next day by 12 noon! I’ve never had anything arrive so soon! I knew I’d love it since all I have is apple products (iPhones, Mac and Apple Watch). No dents, cracks or damaged anything. Amazon box arrived with protective packaging inside, along next to a new, never opened iPad box. All the accessories were inside, nothing damaged."
B07BTS2KWK,13,125,Stop reading and buy this iPad,N. Smith,5,Yes,31-Mar-19,1,0,"I upgraded from my iPad 3rd generation. The screen is the same size but it’s amaller in every other way. The bezel is minimal comparade to the old one meaning I get the same screen performance in a much slimmer package. The Apple Pencil compatibility is an awesome addition. Let’s be for real though, this iPad rocks because it’s so affordable. If want the strongest fastest processor with the coolest technology and the best screen you’ll pay a significant amount more for a more premium iPad (pro, mini or air). If money is a factor this is your iPad!"
B07BTS2KWK,13,126,Lighter than previous version,Cathe Simmons,5,Yes,06-Sep-18,5,0,"Just as described, arrived on time and works great!"
B07BTS2KWK,13,127,For an iPad this is a great deal.,Kindle Customer,4,Yes,03-Apr-19,2,1,"On Apples website you will pay $70 more. For $250 new this is a great purchase. We still have our 16gb iPad 3 (2012) and it still works fine with great battery life. We paid around $400-$500 for it so for half the price I get a new iPad with twice the memory. If you want an iPad that will last a couple more years just get the new iPad Air with the A12 chip which is 2 years newer than this. Also, it’s twice the price of this so take that in consideration. Overall I would say this is Apples best deal for an iPad."
B07BTS2KWK,13,128,iPad is the best,do_catmando,5,Yes,07-Feb-19,2,0,"My family owns many Apple products and this replaced a 2nd Gen iPad. That is still going but it was slow and had to replace it. There are no complaints and it works flawlessly. But be warned that it is bulkier than the iPad Air. If you are used to the light Air, this will come as a surprise. Other than that, we love it."
B07BTS2KWK,13,129,Great for movie watching,Suzann,5,Yes,21-Apr-19,1,0,"I wanted a tablet to play games on because the phone is hard to see. I got this iPad and it's a great iPad but it's too big to hold on to. I love everything about it but its size. So I'm giving this to my granddaughter for video watching and buying the iPad mini. This is a perfect size for watching movies or videos. It's also great for games, but I have to move hand around too much so the smaller size will be better for games. This is a great product, just not for what I want. I still would recommend it as a product!!!"
B07BTS2KWK,13,130,Great entry tablet,Chris C.,5,Yes,27-Dec-18,1,0,"If you are considering something for general use you really can’t go wrong with this iPad. The pricing over the holidays was amazing - Apple Pencil gen 1 works great as does the Logitech crayon for kiddos. My daughter had a kids edition tablet that was just getting too slow - as much as I didn’t want to get her a full blown tablet, I decided apple was the best ecosystem for something with parental controls and a great educational app eco system. Very happy with this purchase. Quick delivery from amazon too!"
B07BTS2KWK,14,131,Much faster than my iPad 2 and 3 and Mini,CarolinaBoy,5,Yes,23-Mar-19,1,0,"I decided to upgrade because a few of my favorite apps are not supported in the latest edition on my older iPads, which are stuck (I guess forever) on iOS 9.x. I wasn't expecting the basic iPad 6th gen unit to be that much faster, but it is. Much faster screen loads and processing of everything, not to mention a considerably lighter and thinner unit. I don't use my iPad all that much (news reader, occasional email reader, etc.), so this base model 6th gen at or under $300 is just great."
B07BTS2KWK,14,132,Best Purchase EVER.,Elmer,5,Yes,18-Mar-19,2,0,"I gotta say, I’m pretty happy about this purchase! I bought this BRAND NEW 6th gen Ipad for the sheer fact that it was on sale for 329 (shout out to amazon) for the beautiful 128GB model. It’s a KILLER price compared to the full retail from apple. I’m super satisfied with buying this iPad, I fix these devices for a living and I discovered that this newest model pretty much uses the exact same glass digitizer part used in the first generation IPad Air model (look it up). I’m very pleased knowing that in the long run, repairs will be a lot more affordable for this device. :)"
B07BTS2KWK,14,133,a real disappointment,Hampster,1,Yes,21-Apr-19,1,1,"The unit locked and I could not gain access to the iPad within 24 hours of my purchase. I spent 2-3 hours loading all of my apps and info. In order to open the unit if you do not remember or something goes wrong with the entry code, you have to erase everything on the iPad and start over. In order to do this, you apparently have to load itunes, even if you don't want itunes on the iPad. I spent over an hour with an Apple Tech via chat, escalating to a manager, with no fix. I ended up sending the iPad back and buying a Samsung 9.7 tablet. Chat with Apple was lengthy and painful and did not fix."
B07BTS2KWK,14,134,As Always - good,Merritt Wiley,4,Yes,18-Oct-18,4,1,The product is good and the shipping was timely - what more could you ask for?
B07BTS2KWK,14,135,Great price and product!,DRS,5,Yes,06-Jan-19,1,0,"If you are a android lover, read no further. This is a perfect upgrade from my iPad 2 which still runs fine but has become rather slow. The improvements in speed and screen detail in this new iPad are astonishing. The retina display is beautiful! It flies through all my apps! It is also lighter than the iPad 2. The price here on Amazon for a brand new in box item was $80 less than competition on any site. I guess they ordered too many. Love the iPad 128GB 2018 model! Love the price here on Amazon."
B07BTS2KWK,14,136,LOAF IT!!! (Love it X10),MurphyTheMenace,5,Yes,15-Apr-19,-,0,"My older sister is an apple device/accessory whore. Which I don’t hold against her, cause she is a good reference/faulty device pointer outer. However she has an ancient iPad so her opinion was pretty much obsolete. Like her tragic opinion of her smarter, younger, much prettier sister.
Ive been an apple phone user since the ice age. Yes.. cave men had iPhones. And after all my research I decided to go with the oldy but goodie. I wasn’t against using my gold bars for bigger or better, but after the reviews I went with what seemed to be the reliable, more than competent for my needs iPad.
My pet mammoth and pterodactyl are in complete agreeance that I made the right decision. Phew.. they have tempers."
B07BTS2KWK,14,137,Awesome product - has replaced my laptop in my daily use,Flacrabb,5,Yes,03-Jan-19,2,0,"I love this! It has replaced my laptop in my daily use. I teamed this with the ZAGG keyboard case, and it is super functional and easy to use. My laptop is now in the closet, as this can do everything I did on the laptop, and this has a much longer battery life. I worked 5 hours on a non-stop flight and didn't even go through half the battery power. Kicking myself that I didn't get one sooner, but glad I bought it now."
B07BTS2KWK,14,138,Had small dent on bottem but otherwise great,Angel G.,3,Yes,24-Dec-18,9,0,The product works great and is easy use. All in all a great ipad that my dad loves....but it came with a small dent right out of the package. Someone in Q.A at the apple plant was not doing their job if they let this slide
B07BTS2KWK,14,139,Yes please!,P. Cronen,5,Yes,22-Mar-19,2,0,"This iPad is the perfect size, incredible quality, and the touch screen is the first to be able to use the stylus pen . Google ""Today at Apple"" for free courses on many topics from art to typography, photography, making good use of this as I'm learning how to use. Has great tutoring on exel without the need for a mouse"
B07BTS2KWK,14,140,jumped from 4th generation to 6th generation ipad - awesome,Vicki,3,Yes,10-Mar-19,2,0,"6th Generation ipad is smaller in size and is fast! Such a difference from my old ipad 4. Received on time, great packaging and am thinking of buying another for my g'son.
UPDATE: my grandson tells me that this is a mini. It is not a 9.7 inch as advertised. Disappointing. May return."
B07BTS2KWK,15,141,Very happy with purchase.,Portland customer,5,Yes,08-Feb-19,1,0,"I’m not an apple fan, but I have to admit this is an easy and convenient tool. As a windows user, I had to adjust to Apple's concept of file storage. It became much less annoying with the Documents app. I use it for photo references for painting, also games, books, web browsing, e-mail, and messaging. I can use it comfortably resting on the back of my cat, saving myself a stiff neck trying to use the laptop balanced on the arm of the sofa."
B07BTS2KWK,15,142,Fabulous,Scott E.,5,Yes,01-May-19,1,0,This is my first apple product. I have shied away because of the proprietary memory lock out. I have had it for several days and am happy to say how impressive the overall experience is. I have been using a Samsung galaxy tab for about 5 years now. This tablet blows the Samsung right out of the water. The tablet interface is flawless and hyper responsive. Downloads are lightning fast. Blue tooth connection and wifi acquisition are instant. The feel is very good. I am in love
B07BTS2KWK,15,143,The standard for a reason,BS AZ,5,Yes,01-Mar-19,-,1,"They had great deals on these during the holidays and right after, so I decided to upgrade even though I probably didn't really need to. Some of the games I play on my iPad were starting to lag a little with my Air 2, so the slightly updated processor has sped those games back up. Everything else is as you'd expect for an iProduct.
Should you upgrade from a model that's only a couple of generations older? Probably not. If you have a much older iPad 2 or something you'll definitely enjoy the upgrade, but it's not all that much compared to a 2017 model or even an Air. But since the deal was really good I'm still happy with the upgrade and now my kid gets a decent upgrade with my hand-me-down."
B07BTS2KWK,15,144,As advertised,Stephen Timberlake,5,Yes,19-Oct-18,5,0,"Product is exactly as advertised. Brand new in the box, works great. Very satisfied."
B07BTS2KWK,15,145,Apple support could not make the ipad work.,Mister Dean,1,Yes,03-Jan-19,5,1,"I had Apple support help me with ipad. Apple could not revive the Apple ipad, it did not work, activate or could not be used."
B07BTS2KWK,15,146,Life better with Apple 9.7 Gen 6 iPad,Amanda Kidd,5,Yes,07-Mar-19,1,0,"Camera sucks, but hey, i didn’t buy this for the cam. I use this to track my fitness levels and diet. I use it as a whiteboard when I teach my son in class everyday. I also use it as my daily planner. It stays charged ALL day 7am-1130pm with heavy use. I also use a generic stylus pencil with it and works great. I have mine in a hard protective case with a kick stand, and a portable keyboard too. This pad is perfect to size. You can also purchase a case that has a handle on the back side for better carry (great for kiddos or clumsy adults). You won’t go wrong if you just looking for something nice and simple."
B07BTS2KWK,15,147,Great for school and inexpensive,Favour,5,Yes,26-Nov-18,3,0,"I’m a college student, I don’t need a demanding device. I use it to read PowerPoint, online classes, and to write notes. Got this on Black Friday for just $250, I was able to get the Logitech attachment keyboard for $75 with student discount. Value for your money, best $250 I’ve spent."
B07BTS2KWK,15,148,Brand new in the Apple box,M. McCoy,5,Yes,04-Dec-18,3,0,My first iPad and I am impressed. I have an iPhone 7 Plus so I'm not new to iOs but it's certainly much nicer watching movies on a bigger screen vs my iPhone.
B07BTS2KWK,15,149,I like it so far,Lemons,5,Yes,30-Jan-19,-,0,"I do not know about the battery life so did not comment on it.

I am using this with a student at school so it will not get heavy use or abuse. All it will have on it is an educational app.
So this is great for what I am using it for.

This does not have cellular - only WIFI. My Ipad 4 is the same way so I am fine with that. I can grab incognito wifi from all over so it does not matter to me. My car has cellular service for using the wifi in it. That said, if you keep sensitive information on your Ipad and require cellular service then you need to buy the pro version.

I really like the way everything works on this - smoother than my ipad 4 series. Glad I bought this."
B07BTS2KWK,15,150,Never turned on,P. Santhakumari,1,Yes,14-Feb-19,5,0,it never turned on. But when I returned they charged me $49.80 Restocking fee.
B07BTS2KWK,16,151,Love Love Love!,M. S. K.,5,Yes,10-Jan-19,1,0,"My iPad Air was getting sluggish and the latest iPad (2018) is the best value around especially during Black Friday sale. I use it to browse the web and email, light word processing...etc. so don't need a lot of storage. 32GB is perfect for my usage - I can download a few shows from Netflix or Amazon to view offline if needed. This model is compatible with the 1st gen Apple Pencil - I have not tried it yet but may pick one up when the price comes down."
B07BTS2KWK,16,152,Love!!!,Christina Cralley,5,Yes,28-Dec-18,2,0,"Love it! This is the third one we’ve bought for our family. So easy to use, my 6 year old and 4 year old can operate it. You definitely need a case though .. do not even open it before you have a case for it. You drop it, the screen shatters! Save yourself the heartache."
B07BTS2KWK,16,153,Like it very much,Hanapink,5,Yes,21-Dec-18,1,0,"I first was leery about purchasing ipad online because I'm not very savvy about IT gadget. I'm glad I did. The ipad arrives very quickly and first set up was fairly easy. The only problem so far was the monitor freezing up when I was on You Tube. I found how to fix it on internet and it was solved no sweat. I have had it for a month now, and haven't had opportunity to explore other functions yet. I am very satisfied right now."
B07BTS2KWK,16,154,Amazon shipped the wrong color. Otherwise easy to transfer settings and setup.,EMP,4,Yes,22-Dec-18,1,0,"Ordered a Silver model (silver back, white front) but Amazon sent a Gray model (gray back, black front), The shrinkwrap label said ""Silver"" but the box said ""Space Gray"". One star off for that. Ordered as a birthday present for wife. Didn't want to deal with the hassle of exchanging so she kept it. Otherwise, it's an iPad - what can you say? Easy to transfer all settings from old one, 32GB, snappier than the old one. No cons - you know what to expect from Apple."
B07BTS2KWK,16,155,Very Pleased with New iPad,cnjcustomer,5,Yes,27-Jan-19,1,0,I wasn't planning to replace my existing non-Apple tablet but a great price from Amazon was too good to pass up. The difference between the iPad and the older tablet is huge with the iPad having a great display and very sturdy feel. It also meshes well with my other Apple products. I am very impressed with the long battery life (although recharging takes much longer than it does on my iPhone 8). The iPad has a very sturdy feel.
B07BTS2KWK,16,156,Do not try to resell this ipad please!,Melissa F.,1,Yes,19-Dec-18,5,2,"This was a defective product, we have had 3 series if ipads. Never have we had one turn on and off constantly and nit charge. Weas this a refurbished i-pad??"
B07BTS2KWK,16,157,Great intro to the Ipad. Simple to use and navigate,sprtsgirl,5,Yes,01-Apr-19,-,0,"I have Never owned an Ipad. Little late to the game. Other Apple electronics &#55357;&#56836;. Having this is like owning a giant phone! Meaning it is great for apps. I use it mainly for POS for collecting payments. Checking my daily schedule on other apps, I am self -emplyed and contract my services each job has there own scheduling system and having the big screen helps. Apple pay via text is great. VENMO( though that app only views vertically), Square, Cash App, Paypal though you cant use Zelle. So far it is great for my business needs. For the price it is a great introduction to iPads and I love the color. Matched perfectly to my keyboard cover."
B07BTS2KWK,16,158,Actual review to be posted later,Cynthia Hart,1,Yes,07-Mar-19,2,0,"Received my NEW iPad today. No protective packing inside of box. Crossing my fingers that my iPad will ACTUALLY work when I turn it on. Bought this to replace my Kindle, that is still in warranty, but will only be replaced by a refurbished machine."
B07BTS2KWK,16,159,Great Price,Amazon Customer,4,Yes,11-Apr-19,1,0,Bought this as a replacement to an Android tablet. I have been pleasantly surprised by the features of this device. I tend to use the cloud for my storage options so the 32GB model was best option for me. I was so impressed with the Ipad and the price that I bought a second one for my son who is starting University this spring semester. I decided against the pro version Because this model supports the pen and unless you are REALLY!!! fixated on screen clarity this model should be fine. I prefer the finger ID versus the face id of the pro version. Also I am rather old school and like a designated home button. My toddler really likes coloring with the pen(not apple's but that is another review) and usually ask if she can use it daily. I do part time handy work and some welding and I use it to draw out plans and notes for different jobs when I am gathering details to make a quote.
B07BTS2KWK,16,160,Good Product at a Good Price,Brian Norwood,5,Yes,13-Nov-18,3,0,"I've been very impressed with the iPad. It is easy to use, has lots of memory and is just what I was looking for. I can use it, along with the iPencil, to create art in the Procreate app., handle email, do FaceTime. Just exactly what I needed. Got it quickly and in perfect condition...."
B07BTS2KWK,17,161,Dead pixels at opening?,Saavystephie,3,Yes,10-Feb-19,2,0,I’m not sure what happened but when I took this out of the box there were at least 4 dead pixels on the screen. My husband says they don’t bother him and wanted to keep the iPad so he didn’t have to wait for a replacement but it is still incredibly disappointing and not at all what was expected out of a new apple product
B07BTS2KWK,17,162,Perfect for any tablet user,Sampson,5,Yes,20-Mar-19,-,0,"I got this as a gift for our daughter. Great value and quality. As with any Apple product, it meets or exceeds all expectations. Easy to setup with your iTunes account, and if you need any additional details regarding iPad technical details, fear not for this is by far the best tablet in the market. Sure, others boast about their ability for customization, etc - but for the overall user, I would argue most of us just need it to be functional, intuitive and reliable. All of which, are standard practices for Apple devices. I might be biased, but that’s earned by their ability to always overdeliver with all of their product lineups."
B07BTS2KWK,17,163,it works! A great buy! Sharp screen!,Mike Kitsko,5,Yes,10-Mar-19,-,0,"Just received Friday, so don’t know about battery life, but so far looks great. No hassle setting up, even for me, closing in on age 80! Most of all it works! The touch screen is perfect. It updated immediately to 12.1.4. And it was about $100 less than my 16GB Air that never worked right! It refused to update for years! And Apple was no help at any time. I had the Pro 11” in my cart when I read it has no audio out jack! A necessary feature I use a lot. I don’t want to mess with adapters, and you have to pay for them. With all the addons I was around $1300! Now, for $326 I am happy as a pig in mud! I recommend this!"
B07BTS2KWK,17,164,Excellent iPad for the price!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,01-Jan-19,2,1,"This iPad is sleek and lightweight. The color is beautiful and a rose gold tone. I particularly love the screen. Anyone can set it up as it’s extremely user friendly. I use it for art, reading, browsing the web, watching videos. Later on I’m ordering the Apple Pencil first generation for my art. As far as durability I immediately put it in a safe case and added a screen cover so I can’judge durability. I would definitely recommend buying this iPad."
B07BTS2KWK,17,165,iPad 32gb,iBuy Stuff,5,Yes,21-Mar-19,2,0,Bought this for my kids and it works as it should. System and apps run smoothly and has a good battery life. Decent parental controls and measures to prevent kids from making purchases thanks to Touch ID feature.
B07BTS2KWK,17,166,It's Apple what else?,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,16-Feb-19,-,0,"Bought this as a travel device so I am not lugging my giant laptop through airports and hotels all the time. Love my iPhone and thought this would be the easiest to get used to since all the screens and functions are basically the same.
Thought about an iPad Pro but the price difference for me was a bit much for my intended use. I find myself using it to watch TV and sports while I am in the kitchen or before bed since it is so portable. Battery life is adequate so far I have not had it run down while using it. If you need a Pro get one but if you want to save some money get 6th Gen with enough memory for what you intend to do with it."
B07BTS2KWK,17,167,Not like a new product?????,Amazon Customer,3,Yes,26-Jan-19,4,0,"The edge of the screen, I can feel some sticky things as you may see there. I am not sure if this is a issue made from Manufacturing process but it feels like this is a scretch. &#55357;&#56873;"
B07BTS2KWK,17,168,Simply Amazing!,areg,5,Yes,30-Mar-19,-,0,"This device has the most beautiful screen I've ever seen. The OS on this is amazing as well: it's extremely user-friendly, fast and responsive, has lots of settings I can tweak, and, most importantly it lets me uninstall almost every factory app I consider unnecessary. I'll be using this primarily as a PDF reading device: it's 4:3 screen is perfect for that. And, if letter size is an issue, I can crop my PDFs on an editor on PC and then drop those on iPad: this will let me read comfortably in portrait single-page made without the need to zoom in every page.
This is my first Apple device, by the way : now I get why people fall in love with this stuff."
B07BTS2KWK,17,169,It’s an iPad,Anon Ymous,5,Yes,29-Dec-18,1,0,What can I say? It’s an iPad. Didn’t want to spend the money on a pro as I mostly intend to use this for electronic signatures on paperwork for our business using interactive PDFs. It’s snappy and runs well. Was priced very well over Black Friday. It has a lot of capabilities through apps and works amazingly well for a lightweight portable document management solution for our service oriented business.
B07BTS2KWK,17,170,Good Product,devsatg,4,Yes,23-Feb-19,2,0,"Bought the 32GB version for $250. Came in nice packaging. About the products itself, well its an ipad and performs faster than the previous ipad I had owned (ipad 4). Its very lightweight, but I get a feeling that it won't survive a fall of few feet, which my previous ipad did several times.
Pros : Awesome Display, Nice Camera, Good Speakers.
Cons : Battery, Lack of face unlock, build quality"
B07BTS2KWK,18,171,DON’T UPGRADE TO IOS 12.2 !!,Tamera G. Strong,1,Yes,14-Apr-19,1,1,"All was fine right out of the box, until it updated to IOS 12.2. Now it will not stay connected to my WiFi, and will not load the Facebook App. I am so profoundly disappointed. I have been buying refurbished iPads, and my last one was a 3rd edition. I finally decided to save up and buy my first CURRENT, brand new iPad......and I am now stuck with it. Crap....."
B07BTS2KWK,18,172,I absolutely LOVE my iPad! Great for College Students,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,04-Jan-19,1,0,"I wanted an iPad as a lighter alternative to carrying my MacBook to and from school and work. This has been a lifesaver! I love all of the new functions especially when multitasking! I have an iPad mini but I found that the screen wasn't as large as I'd like and it limited me while using it. The display is so sharp, and it's extremely responsive! Great for taking my school notes, completely replaced my old notebook and laptop combo!"
B07BTS2KWK,18,173,Excellent device at the right price,MBNYCUES,5,Yes,08-Nov-18,3,0,Exactly what I was looking for and exactly as described. Love the gold color. Works perfectly.
B07BTS2KWK,18,174,Apple iPads are still the best for Kids,Bad Dude,5,Yes,28-Dec-18,1,0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Son, and I wish I had bought it sooner. He has enjoyed it immensely, and is learning a lot of cool and exciting things about everything around us. The product is amazing and simple to use. I added an Otter Box case for it, and I am glad I did because it really does protect the machine. iPads are great, and you should buy one for your Children!"
B07BTS2KWK,18,175,it went over my expectations!,Mary Mangum,5,Yes,03-Feb-19,1,0,"I have always wanted an Ipad because I like IOS better then Android but that is my personal opinion. I bought this exact one due to it being in my price range. I honestly didn't know what to expect. I love how its compatible with the Apple pencil wich is a plus. I use it mainly to check my Facebook, watch Netflix and amazon prime movies. The battery life on this is amazing. Also if you have a iPhone it will recognize it and when you get a text you can actually text people back from it. its a nice little feature for when my phone is on the charger. I did purchase the Apple pen as well because I wanted to get into digital art and mess around with that aspect as well. I have not had any issues with it and its been running smoothly. I'm really glad I bought this, Defiantly worth the price."
B07BTS2KWK,18,176,Great ??,Adrian Sterling,5,Yes,31-Jul-18,4,0,Works as advertised
B07BTS2KWK,18,177,Tablets aren't dead,Jimmy,5,Yes,04-Mar-19,-,0,"This is the first apple product I've bought since my old Ipod touch 2nd gen yeaaaars ago. I wanted a nice multimedia device to watch content on and maybe play a few games. So far, this latest version of the iPad has greatly exceeded my expectations. It is very snappy, the screen looks amazing for the price, and the battery life is stellar.

Some improvements (probably incoming on the new gen) I would want would be a smaller bezel (the bezel on these do look very outdated in 2019), faster charging, as well as USB-C. This is my only lightning device, and sometimes its annoying to have to seek that cable out vs the many usb-c cables I have."
B07BTS2KWK,18,178,"your typical apple product, lacks accessories",Pipe Chapman,3,Yes,27-Nov-18,3,2,"Lacks the bigger, better screen, quad speakers and more importantly, it doesn't have the Smart Connector found on more expensive iPad Pros. It doesn't come with a pencil, case, or keyboard. If you have to get any of these pieces, it'll definitely drive up the price. The great thing about ipad is portability and ease of use."
B07BTS2KWK,18,179,It's An iPad,ShaneRa1n,4,Yes,21-Mar-19,2,0,Well built with buttery smooth iOS. Was considering the iPad Pro 10.5 but happy with this purchase thus far. Saved a bunch of money so I can get some accessories and have money left over.
B07BTS2KWK,18,180,Best tablet I have ever used.,Wasabi on my Fries,5,Yes,10-Mar-19,-,0,"I have been using this tablet for two things mainly: reading comics/manga and to draw. I was going to buy a Kindle before getting this, but I'm so glad I didn't. With a matte screen protector and a low light night setting, the iPad 6th gen is an excellent reading device. Just bright enough to see what you are reading in the dark, but not too bright to cause eye strain. Along with the Apple pencil and procreate, this is the best tablet I have used to draw. The pencil is so accurate and so much better than using a Wacom tablet. 32 gbs is more than enough space for what I need and the app store has everything you could ask for. I can't recommend it enough."
B07BTS2KWK,19,181,everybody know this,wally,4,Yes,13-Feb-19,1,0,"always good! i always buy iPad for My kids,this is for My dad,he require me to order the latest iPad,just the price is not the best this time,i can not to wait! only complaint apple ios always require update iOS,but it do not good for old device,and your device will not be support by many APPs if you do not update system,maybe just want customer to buy newest again and again."
B07BTS2KWK,19,182,This iPad is better than anticipated! More like a computer than just a tablet!,Night Owl,5,Yes,02-Dec-18,1,0,"I like everything about this iPad! Smooth, easy to use, & beautiful.
I had special delivery instructions included asking deliveries be left inside the front porch. The door was unlocked. The delivery driver left my package w/iPad & case outside the front door, inspite of instructions! My front door is approximately 6’ from the sidewalk. Per tracking the driver noted he hand delivered it! That is not true!! I wasn’t home when my package was left outside my front door!"
B07BTS2KWK,19,183,Wonderful. What can I say?,Ben,5,Yes,11-Mar-19,1,0,"It's an iPad. You know what they're good for and what they're not good for.
Great for games, email, photos, and this is my favorite web browsing device. Pretty good at productivity and storing and showing documents to people without having to pull out my laptop. Good for light to moderate note taking. But for things like serious word processing you might want to stick with a laptop or buy a bluetooth keyboard."
B07BTS2KWK,19,184,iPads are such a great product.,Jimmie H. Gorham,5,Yes,06-Jan-19,1,0,"I bought 3 iPads for Christmas, 2 from Amazon and 1 from Best Buy. I had to buy two different colors from Amazon, as Apple limited each purchase to 1 unit. I would have bought the 3rd from Amazon as well, but couldn’t get around that purchase limit. My kids love their iPads, and have used them to play Fortnite, watch YouTube and watch TV. Everything has worked great so far. I also bought covers and screen protectors from Amazon, and all have worked as described. Very happy with my purchases."
B07BTS2KWK,19,185,Feels cheap,John Tebbutt,2,Yes,12-Mar-19,-,2,"I got this as an upgrade to my 16GB iPad Air 2 (I was always running out of memory). But it didn't feel like an upgrade. It is noticeably thicker, heavier and less comfortable to hold than the Air 2. Not only that, but it doesn't have the feel of quality that we've come to expect from Apple - doesn't feel solid. Instead it has a plasticky, bendy sort of feel, the screen feels thin and when you tap the screen you get a hollow sound and feel. I returned it and bought a refurbished iPad Air 2 64GB and am much happier."
B07BTS2KWK,19,186,Brand new iPad 128 GB,Jordan P Hubbard,5,Yes,30-Aug-18,4,0,Exactly as advertised
B07BTS2KWK,19,187,Fast and pretty!,Diana Zinn,5,Yes,01-Apr-19,2,0,"I love my new IPad. My old IPad 2 was not working as well as it did so this is a breath of fresh air for me. The dusty rose is so pretty!
Sold on Apple products."
B07BTS2KWK,19,188,Very responsive,Matthews,5,Yes,22-Mar-19,2,0,"The iPad was everything I expected it to be and more. The touch screen was far more responsive than previous models I have worked with and the processing speed feels far fast than the older models I have worked with. Apps load faster , and respond quicker to commands. All and all very happy with my purchase."
B07BTS2KWK,19,189,Great or terrible depending on expectations,Lucore,3,Yes,20-Mar-19,1,1,"Difficult to review. Hardware wise it could not be better, but out of the box Apple controls every part of the user experience and it's very aggravating. Basically, apparrently unless a certain change is made that starts with a J, I find there isn't a whole lot I can do with it. So I don't know, time will tell."
B07BTS2KWK,19,190,Value purchase,Arindam Paul,5,Yes,22-Feb-19,-,0,"I don't think one would imagine an apple product to be a value purchase. But I think it is. If you get an iPad for 270 odd with 5% cash back ~ you get an iPad for less than 260 and it is a steal. I have added a keyboard cover with it and am really happy with it. I think for home entertainment, this is the perfect device. I use it for reading news, watching YouTube/Netflix/other streaming as well as reading books. I am very happy with it. Also because I have an iPhone and Mac, it fits well with my apple eco-system."
B07BTS2KWK,20,191,First timer,scaryshopper,4,Yes,31-Dec-18,1,0,"My first iPad. I really like it. I was able to transfer content from my Samsung phone. Loved that. I still think Samsung tablet is easier, more intuitive, but I returned my similar Samsung tablet because it was just like a bigger version of my phone. I wanted something different in my tablet. I like that I now have some Apple apps like FaceTime. I’m enjoying it."
B07BTS2KWK,20,192,Apple products are the best,J. B. Pennington,5,Yes,28-Nov-18,3,0,Great price for a superior product...
B07BTS2KWK,20,193,it's an ipad! you get what you expect!,Cassondra Hammond,5,Yes,19-Jan-19,1,0,"I think at this point everyone knows what an iPad is, so my review won't really stray from what you're already thinking or expect when you buy it. I've been an Apple product user for 7 years, so I just feel committed to the brand. I've always had the iPad mini, so it was a nice upgrade to have a bigger screen and bigger memory!"
B07BTS2KWK,20,194,Awful battery,Kelly,2,Yes,14-Jan-19,1,0,"Came brand new, sealed in package but I suspect it was professionally repackaged because the iPad itself won’t hold a charge long and if you’re doing something on The tablet and it needs to Ben plugged in it won’t increase in battery percentage. It goes down by or remains at the percentage you plugged it in at. It also takes an incredibly long time To reach 100% battery life. Typically 9–12 hours."
B07BTS2KWK,20,195,It is an iPad. I use it to grade essays.,Sarah E Howard,5,Yes,30-Dec-18,1,0,"The iPad gets on the internet using WiFi and has apps. The apps let me play games and draw. I bought an Apple Pencil and it seems to work rather well. You can say “Hey Siri” and it will reply to your questions. It also takes pictures with the camera and makes videos. You can use FaceTime to chat with family who have iOS devices. The screen is the perfect size, and I would never buy a pro. Maybe I would because the bezels are smaller...if I had more money. I am not a power user, just using it to lecture and grade student essays submitted online. I also line iMessage and the weather app. Apple maps is not that bad, but I do not use it on an iPad."
B07BTS2KWK,20,196,Great replacement for older model. A10 fushion makes it much faster.,lulu,5,Yes,17-Dec-18,1,0,"Purchased this for my husband along with the keyboard case: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JRC2TZ4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
He loves them both.
What I don't love is that I purchased this on December 7th and 10 days later it's $20 cheaper. I hate that, don't you?"
B07BTS2KWK,20,197,Still not sure it’s worth the upgrade price,BJ,5,Yes,16-Jan-19,1,0,"My grandson wanted my old pad so, I decided to upgrade to this one. The old one was slow advancing as I typed. Run on words being the issue. This one is no better. Not sure why. I’m a one finger typist, so I’m not that fast. Overall I like it. It’s an iPad. What’s not to like. Battery life is much better."
B07BTS2KWK,20,198,Amazing!,Miranda Jackson-Boone,5,Yes,25-Feb-19,-,0,"I have never owned an Apple iPad, so this is my first and I love it! Extremely happy with it and use it daily for reading, playing the occasional games, browsing the internet and so much more! The price was great compared to many other store’s prices. I couldn’t afford to buy the Apple pen therefore I bought an ADRAWPEN for this tablet and it works perfectly! I highly recommend this iPad especially if you’ve never owned an Apple iPad, you will not regret it!"
B07BTS2KWK,20,199,Worth the money,Toni,5,Yes,11-Feb-19,1,0,After 9 year of have the first iPad 2 I thought it was time to upgrade because it was extremely outdated. I enjoyed the ipad so I decided to get the newest version. The ipad works just like the old one but has new ways to geting around different apps. The audio and clean display screen is definitely the best part of the iPad. I'm not a fan of the fingerprint unlock feature because a lot of the time i have trouble use it. Other then that the ipad Is a great buy.
B07BTS2KWK,20,200,Fabulous!,avidreader,5,Yes,02-Apr-19,1,0,"I was sad when my old mini-iPad needed to be replaced but this new model is way better in every way. I unwittingly wound up with a larger model (9.7"") and find it so much easier to use. I'm still learning some of the newer features and couldn't be happier. And it cost the same as the smaller version I had before."
B07BTS2KWK,21,201,No surprises,Kindle Customer,5,Yes,24-Aug-18,4,0,Love it. Glad I purchased
B07BTS2KWK,21,202,"Sealed, brand new, authentic. Great price!",abc1111,5,Yes,17-Apr-19,-,0,"I don't know about other reviewers here but the iPad I got is sealed and in perfect condition. It is not refurbished. It is packaged just like the devices I get from Apple online. I recently bought three other iPads, AirPods, and Apple Pencil so my basis for comparison is pretty fresh. I especially wonder about the customer who got tiles inside her box. Sounds like an Amazon scam. This is already $80 off retail. Such a good deal."
B07BTS2KWK,21,203,"3 A’ s Awesome, Apple, Amazon",Blitz,5,Yes,29-Apr-19,1,0,"Replaced my gen 2 with this gen 6. Both had Retina screens so still awesome video. Improved sound with 2 speakers. Lightning fast operation. Much improved os functionality. Amazing value. Great capability in such a small package at such a good price. Don’t have an Apple Pen so no comments.
Delivery and packaging from Amazon was great as usual."
B07BTS2KWK,21,204,Quite a heavy tablet,aseriousloverofbooks,5,Yes,29-Mar-19,-,0,"This replaces my Gen 4 iPad that can only be updated to IOS 9. I like the rich gold color. I especially like the fingerprint identification and I have to laugh that I thought that was pretty silly before I tried it. Siri has a nicer voice on this model and definitely understands me better. Faster processing; it seems much faster than my Gen 4. It’s slimmer than my Gen 4 but somehow, it’s heavier otherwise it’s the same dimensions."
B07BTS2KWK,21,205,"My first iPad, and I love it!",Courtney Newlin,5,Yes,24-Nov-18,2,0,"I absolutely love this iPad! This is my first Apple product, so I am amazed by the quality. The interface has been easy to use, and the price was affordable. I am very pleased with this purchase."
B07BTS2KWK,21,206,Dos Everything you need for half the price.,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,18-Mar-19,-,0,"Apple has the best tabletas, period. For what a tablet can do this one is the best option regarding price-performance ratio. The only one that you can't compare this one with is the iPad pro, but it still does 95% of the things the Pro does for half the price.

Performance is great for games or heavy años. Multitasking is great. Screen is really good for the price. Apple pencil response works great. Enough memory.

My only complains would be the space around the Screen is big but you get used to it. And also some apps are not able for multitasking but they are really few.

MY conclusion is: For the price is the best you can get."
B07BTS2KWK,21,207,Excelente----,Jorge Kindermann,5,Yes,12-Aug-18,5,0,Es como tener el Ipad Pro pero más barato...
B07BTS2KWK,21,208,El buen servicio,Gabriela Grimaldi M.,5,Yes,18-Nov-18,2,0,"Me agradó recibir mi tableta incluso antes del tiempo pautado.
Recibí mi tableta muy bien sin inconvenientes de ningún tipo.
Estoy muy complacida."
B07BTS2KWK,21,209,The sweet spot,angelroundtrip,5,Yes,16-Apr-19,-,0,"I debated on getting an iPad Pro, but decided not to because Apple doesn't want to put a useful OS on it. So I got this iPad instead for $330 and I'm more than pleased.

Works well with all of the simple things. I can use Lightroom and a few other Adobe apps to do some simple edits, which I love. I use a few other editing and learning software and it also works well. And of course, your favorite streaming apps will all work flawlessly.

I, as do many others, feel that this iPad is the sweet spot in terms of price and performance for the time being.

RECOMMEND:
YES! I highly recommend this iPad to most anyone. Screen size and price at both right, as is performance."
B07BTS2KWK,21,210,Latest iPad,M. C.,5,Yes,08-Jan-19,1,0,"I absolutely love my new iPad! Our old one was a 3rd generation and was really slow. Of course there were no more software updates for that one, so it was finally time to upgrade. The new one (6th gen.) is super fast and has some new features that I like. Very handy to have around the house because you can do so much with them."
B07BTS2KWK,22,211,It’s a legit iPad.,Alan H.,5,Yes,05-Jan-19,1,0,"Wife loves the iPad! She gave up her iPad Air 2 for my son a few years ago, when his iPad 2 stopped accepting updates on the games. This one is replacing the iPad 2, and it’s great so far! Stores are still selling these for $429, so it’s a great deal too."
B07BTS2KWK,22,212,Great tablet!,Nicole,5,Yes,13-Mar-19,-,0,"I have only had this iPad for about a week, but I am in love with it. I was originally looking for refurbished iPads, but found this listing for a brand new one and could not pass up the price. It does everything I need it to (though, I only need it for basic word processing and ameture photo editing). Screen quality is awesome, and I have had no problem with the battery life thus far. Overall Really happy with my purchase!"
B07BTS2KWK,22,213,"Good device, recommended for everyday usage",Hisham EL-Azem,4,Yes,22-Feb-19,-,0,"Upgraded to this one because the battery on air 2 is non replacable in my country and its risky to replace it by yourself as you might completly break the screen
Amazon could not ship this directly to me so if you like this one you might need shop & ship services like i did ... You will pay extra 35 usd for that so beware of the price
Battery lasts about 6 hours per day and the performance is a small upgrade over the ipad air 2 ... Wifi seems alot better on this one and the 128gb internal is a nice upgrade as well
Device sound is great and it has nice bass to it probably to beats tuning by apple"
B07BTS2KWK,22,214,Back of Ipad gets Very Hot,Ihor Petrenko,3,Yes,09-Apr-19,1,1,"Very concerned. Using my new Ipad for more than fifteen minutes and the back of the Ipad gets very very hot. Does not seem normal and I wish I could get a human being to answer my question if this is a faulty Ipad or if this is a new feature of being so hot. Last Ipad I owned did not do this. Old one became warm to the touch, but not this hot."
B07BTS2KWK,22,215,My 3rd iPad. Best tablet for the money!,Chris A. Kantack,5,Yes,06-Apr-19,-,0,"I've owned the original iPad 1, iPad Air, and now this iPad 2018 model. This is my best iPad yet and considerably cheaper than my first two models! It is very similar to the original iPad Air. The faster processor adds a bit of quickness my iPad Air lacks and the WiFi on this 2018 model is definitely faster than what is on my iPad Air. But for you current iPad Air owners, I wouldn't bother upgrading unless you really want an additional iPad. By far the 2018 iPad is the best ""bang for your buck"" model."
B07BTS2KWK,22,216,The best option for an iPad!! Fully recommended,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,23-Mar-19,1,0,"I love my nw iPad! Works awesome and smooth, I’ve been using it for a month before leaving this review and it has been nice! Also it is compatible with Apple pencil (which I bought too) and it’s excellent for taking notes at school or work. Fully recommended."
B07BTS2KWK,22,217,I love my iPad,Papo,5,Yes,13-Apr-19,-,1,"So I purchased this was the full intention to have this as a baby shutter upper for my sons 2nd b day. But I fell in love with it. It’s sexy design, it’s huge seen, it’s seemingly long battery life. But then I realized (even though
My wife suckered me into buying the apple care) I can’t let my beautiful precious son who loves to throw his food across the table and call me by my government/Christian name when I ignoring him tote this around and run the risk of him getting pissed and doing the same to this thing as he does my mother in laws terrible meatloaf. I especially don’t want for his mentally handicap older step brother to get his dirty mitts on it and installing roblox and watching those darn toy review videos on it. No thank you. This is mine. And I’m loving it."
B07BTS2KWK,22,218,Excellent condition and arrived on time,Charletta (Charlie) B,4,Yes,23-Oct-18,3,0,I really like the iPad. Item arrived on time and package quality was great. Item arrived new as expected
B07BTS2KWK,22,219,Five Stars,Christian L.,5,Yes,25-Jul-18,3,0,"Daughter loves it, works perfectly for her artwork, videos, and gaming"
B07BTS2KWK,22,220,Great for both adults and kids,Chrissy C,5,Yes,15-Mar-19,-,0,"Both my 4 year old son and I love the iPad and use it daily. Yes, it's pricier than other tablets but the quality of the picture, ease of use and convenience of the touch screen make the iPad a winner in the category. Apple clearly knows they have a great product since they haven't made many modifications to the regular iPad. And I hope they don't, because this is a great and well made product!"
B07BTS2KWK,23,221,iPad never disappoints!,Jody P,5,Yes,29-Dec-18,1,0,I still have a first generation iPad but can no longer update the operating system because of its age. This new one has become my primary pad. It’s much faster and the memory seems more than adequate for the storage space I need. It’s very lightweight and user friendly. I’m very happy with my purchase.
B07BTS2KWK,23,222,Apple Ipad 2018,Donna Capshaw,5,Yes,28-Jan-19,-,0,"I love this ipad. I started it up and it synced with my iphone. I only had to set up a few other things and was in business. This pad is the perfect size and is not too heavy. I went from Android to Apple phone a few months ago and am now a huge fan so I had to have this to go with it. My next purchase will be a Macbook, but I gotta save my nickles and dimes! I want to never have to deal with another ""windows""."
B07BTS2KWK,23,223,buy again,Dennis,4,Yes,11-Sep-18,3,0,Quick delivery and good product A++
B07BTS2KWK,23,224,Just like I bought it straight from apple,Froggie0115,5,Yes,24-Apr-19,-,0,"This was exactly what I expected. I ordered the 129gb model and that is exactly what I got. It was wrapped in the plastic and was definitely brand new. At the time of writing this it was $100 cheaper than buying direct, so it is perfect.
As for the iPad itself I got it to replace an iPad I purchased new in 2012, so the 7 year difference has definitely demonstrated some upgrades!"
B07BTS2KWK,23,225,Great Picture,Todd K.,5,Yes,08-Apr-19,1,0,"Much better picture than previous models. Apple finally started to bring their I Pad cost down. Old (one of the first)one was getting too slow. Pretty sure they make it that way with updates. It was in great shape. I did not want to pay $5-600 to replace. It was much more reasonable at $249. Still higher than other manufacturers, but it is an I Pad."
B07BTS2KWK,23,226,Great,Harrison Salomon,5,Yes,18-Feb-19,1,0,Well it’s an iPad. Very good picture quality. Long battery life. Awesome sync with my phone. Just keep your iPhone next to the iPad and it automatically moves all your info over so you don’t have to put everything in again like email and account info. Very cool.
B07BTS2KWK,23,227,It is a brand new iPad,Elad,5,Yes,17-Apr-19,-,0,"My wife love it, I won't give a feedback for performance because they are already well known. If you looking for a durable and reliable tablet for a few years to watch things and light work this is the tablet for you.

I know the next issue can be either this is a fake or not brand new as promised, well I got a brand new iPad 6th generation as promised with no issues at all to operate."
B07BTS2KWK,23,228,Great value,Aiden Steinle,5,Yes,11-Apr-19,1,0,"It's an iPad - well considered on every front. I've previously owned an iPad Pro, and so I was happily surprised with the quality of the base iPad especially considering the price.

I bought this to replace my kindle fire HD10 which was having battery issues. Although this is about $100 more, it is worth it in every way. Much lighter, nicer screen, easier and more intuitive OS, and fits really well with my other apple devices.

All in all, it's an iPad. Can't really go wrong."
B07BTS2KWK,23,229,Fits right into the rest of the apple family,Elijah wooten,4,Yes,12-Jan-19,-,0,"I am very happy with my purchase. I think it does a very good job at complimenting my other apple devices like my phone or laptop without feeling like an outright replacement. There are many situations where I prefer to have my ipad, but just as many situations where a phone or a laptop is more appropriate. My only gripe is that my iPad is missing some key features from my phone that I really depend on. Like not being able to use 3D Touch, fast charging, or flash. Another great quality of life about my iPad is how easy it is to go back and forth from my iPad and my iPhone. I can start something on my phone and pick up right where I left off when I get home on my iPad.

Overall I think this was a great purchase and for the price, I think I could easily recommend it to any of my fellow apple enthusiast friends."
B07BTS2KWK,23,230,Improvement without being too overpriced.,pedal2go,4,Yes,12-Jan-19,-,0,Light and fast compared to my third gen. iPad. There were differences between the two that required some adjustments. Wasn’t sure that it was needed. The new iOS forced me to upgrade because it cannot be used on my old iPad. I have some suspicions that it also slowed down my internet access speed. I use the old one for viewing downloaded video and new one when I need faster access to internet.
B07BTS2KWK,24,231,Excellent tablet at a great price,farthestnorth,5,Yes,01-Mar-19,-,1,"Where have you been all my life! I have been using cheapo tablets for years. Can’t believe how much nicer this is. Ok so I mainly bought so I can text people from a bigger screen/keyboard. And it’s great for that. But beyond that it’s very easy to use, has a beautiful screen and the battery life is amazing. Always figured I’d have to spend a small fortune on a real iPad but at $250 it’s very affordable. Great buy."
B07BTS2KWK,24,232,Wow! Great product at a great price! My wife could NOT be happier with this iPad.,Lee Runge,5,Yes,01-Apr-19,1,0,"A replacement for an older 4th generation iPad, this one feels like it is half the weight of the old one. If you are shopping for an iPad, you cannot go wrong with this model at this price. Such a great value!!!"
B07BTS2KWK,24,233,great. great for pubg .,Kousou Otsuki,5,Yes,22-Jan-19,1,0,"ran Balanced quality on Extreme FPS, and it ran the same as the it ran on iPad pro. You can go only up to blanaced quality with extreme on the pro anyway. so it is the same. it supports apple pencil too...with no tilt function tho."
B07BTS2KWK,24,234,Quality not good as I expected,John,2,Yes,02-Apr-19,2,0,"I bought this product with apple pencil thinking that it could potentially replace my note taking tools forever. To my dismay, though, the screen just feels cheap. It flexes really easily, and it feels like plastic. When I tried writing with the apple pencil, it just didn't feel right to me."
B07BTS2KWK,24,235,Refurbished as good as new,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,20-Aug-18,4,0,"Totally satisfied, you can't even tell it wasn't brand new, excellent deal!"
B07BTS2KWK,24,236,Performance difference,Kris,5,Yes,14-Apr-19,-,0,"This was replaced from my 3rd generation 16G iPad from 2012 and it is completely different as far as performance. For example, I was not able to browse online without it lagging or simply having trouble opening up websites and using the functions of the websites was problematic. This 2018 iPad which has about double the performance with improved processor and memory is so much better. Everything runs way smoother and the price for the 32G was really good. Everything else is about the same as the old even the display looks about the same but having improved software performance was night and day."
B07BTS2KWK,24,237,Best option of all the different iPads for basic use.,Dave Carver,5,Yes,29-Mar-19,-,0,Finally got tired of fighting for that last one gigabyte of storage space on my original iPad Air. Went for the 128 GB version; lots of extra space now to add any apps I’m interested in and not worry about storage place. New and improved accessibility options are also making it even easier for me to use the iPad; what a big help as my hands don’t work so well anymore.
B07BTS2KWK,24,238,Great for school/note taking and streaming videos and general browsing,Jeppun,5,Yes,01-Mar-19,-,0,For an Ipad its one of the most afforadable.. The most bang for your buck. I use this mainly for streaming and note taking and I works great! I was hesistant in initially getting this for taking notes for class but after recieving it and using it right away it worked seamlessly. The apple pencil does take a little bit to get used to but when you’ve taken pages and pages of notes already you get the hang of it and its just the same as taking notes on paper.. Also it has a variety of functions as well as uploading pdfs and images so you can incorporate then with your notes. If you have the extra cash to get this its really worth it and its nice going paperless and using just one item instead of multiple notebooks is nice.
B07BTS2KWK,24,239,best tablet for the price,Albert,4,Yes,11-Jan-19,1,0,"The display quality and finish are excellent. However, the limited browser and operating system makes it unsuitable for a PC replacement. It is essentially a phone with a very big screen. Without cellular capability, you are stuck looking for a wifi network. So, if you desire a phone with a bigger screen, this is nice, but I would not pay much more because other than a bigger display, it does not do more than a phone and there is no sense carring two devices and two charger around."
B07BTS2KWK,24,240,Absolutely worth the money.,Katherine,5,Yes,29-Mar-19,-,0,"My last iPad was an Air 2, so roughly five years out of date. I went ahead and upgraded to this since I wanted to use the Apple Pencil. I definitely can tell the difference in processing and using multiple apps and better battery life. Nifty to finally have a Touch ID option on the iPad, too. The Pencil works just as well on here as it does on the iPad Pro."
B07BTS2KWK,25,241,YES!!!,NecroAether,5,Yes,27-Dec-18,-,0,I bough both if these for my Mom who was in need of a new tablet and I choose to go with the iPad. We got it after Christmas and my Mom LOVES both! She originally had a 4-5 year old Samsung Galaxy Tablet that was VERY slow. When I finished installing all her games and what not she was SO impressed with how much faster the iPad is over her last tablet. Needless to say she's in love with the iPad!
B07BTS2KWK,25,242,Big IPhonem,ENTITLED2OPINION,3,Yes,02-Feb-19,2,0,For what I use it for it is nothing more than a big iPhone without cellular calling!
B07BTS2KWK,25,243,Sold faulty product,Steven flaughers,1,Yes,11-Dec-18,5,1,I was sold a faulty product. Does not work. Very upset
B07BTS2KWK,25,244,"Amazing value, case it and protect it!",Amazon Customer,5,Yes,18-Jan-19,-,0,"This device is simply amazing, it handles everything you throw at it, even though it’s considered “the budget iPad”. Trust me, it doesn’t feel budget at all. It may lack laminated display, 120 hz, and all that fancy stuff from newer models, yet it still is an amazing piece of equipment when compared to most tablets in the market. However, I’ve found that even though the screen is Gorilla Glass, it’s been very easily scratched, I’ve been babying the iPad ever since I bought it but still, there are some minor scuffs and hairline cracks, nothing major or even noticeable, guess I am pretty picky. Nevertheless, it’s amazing for the price and I have no regrets, do consider buying both a screen protector and a case if you want to protect the aesthetics of your device."
B07BTS2KWK,25,245,Great for Graduate school!,Summer J Melroy,5,Yes,21-Mar-19,2,0,"Tech makes me uneasy, but this came as promised. It works great has been a huge help to me for grad school, there is a lot to read."
B07BTS2KWK,25,246,Typically excellent Apple product! Perfect for college students.,Anne C.,5,Yes,27-Apr-19,1,0,We bought this for our college bound son and he absolutely loves it. It replaced his iPad mini he had used for several years and will surely be using this for many years to come. Very satisfied!
B07BTS2KWK,25,247,IMPRESSIVE,MJ,5,Yes,06-Mar-19,1,0,"My First IPAD. WOW Beautiful. Easy to step up. Screen is crystal clear and pictures Bright and vived.
Such a reasonable price I bought one for my Daughter.

So far No Negatives."
B07BTS2KWK,25,248,Does not operate all programs on internet. Very disappointing,harold patterson,1,Yes,21-Jan-19,3,0,"Will not open my banking app, and have found other that safari won’t operate properly,would send it back it they would take it Bach I hate it"
B07BTS2KWK,25,249,Great value,h. johnson,5,Yes,21-Mar-19,1,0,Replaces a 2nd generation iPad with a broken screen. Very fast and able to run most current apps. Very pleased with the purchase. Arrived on time and well protected Highly recommended.
B07BTS2KWK,25,250,Good,Kathleen,5,Yes,23-Jan-19,1,0,"I bought it for my son, he really likes it. It’s an iPad, what else could I write? Fast and nice, but definitely buy the one with the larger memory. It was the cheapest on amazon also."
B07BTS2KWK,26,251,Great ipad!,J. Palmer,5,Yes,29-Dec-18,1,0,"Happy with this purchase! I knew I wanted a new, non pro, ipad and the black friday price was a no-brainer. Fast, great apps, nice to have had finally upgraded from the ipad 2."
B07BTS2KWK,26,252,"AS GOOD AS IT GETS - IPad 9.7"" is a winner - price is amazing!",Martin B.,5,Yes,25-Feb-19,-,0,"This is a late 2018 version that only requires an update from IOS 11 to IOS 12 when activated - as good as it gets! The price is fantastic, and 128GB is highly recommended when doing any offline storage or music. With the available Kindle app and and off-line magazines, a lower memory is sometime inadequate - the price difference should NOT be an issue..."
B07BTS2KWK,26,253,We love this iPad.,Joy W,5,Yes,21-Dec-18,1,0,"It was easy to use right out of the box. Anyone who likes Apple would like this as a gift, so portable for quick easy carry. So far the battery has held up well ..... We will see in a year or two how well this holds."
B07BTS2KWK,26,254,Sad they choose not to have instructions,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,25-Apr-19,1,2,"I didn't find anything I like yet! What I dislike is that its so hard to get these things set up. It's pretty sad that I'll have to take it to an Apple store to get help setting up. If I could have gotten a new tablet, and not used Apple product, I would have.
Shame on me for buying this crap!"
B07BTS2KWK,26,255,Satisfied but ima have to spill some tea ..,Kdominguez,4,Yes,18-Mar-19,-,2,I’m actually very happy with my purchase since I have been wanting one for months now however you can clearly tell ( and I know this since my dad fixes broken iPhone screens with cheap glass replacements) that this pad was most definitely damaged before. It must have been a broken screen and the seller has replaced with a cheap one. You can tell by the way you lightly tap on the screen it almost feel “empty” inside the iPad itself. Compared to a new iPad the screen feels more hard. Not bad it works just fine tbh but just thought to let y’all know what you’re buying .
B07BTS2KWK,26,256,Get. It.,chasity,5,Yes,09-Dec-18,-,0,"This is my first apple product, I use it for my cricut and crafting, I only hook it up to Wi-Fi. Ive even facetimed on it. It's plenty for what i need it for! Totally reccomend, the battery lasts days for me, hardly ever has it gone below 80% battery. It's a little on the heavy side, and I bought a case for it just in case I drop it."
B07BTS2KWK,26,257,Screen is cracked,B mayo,1,Yes,04-Jan-19,3,1,Bought this as a Christmas gift it has been 2 weeks and the screen is already cracked even with being in an otter case
B07BTS2KWK,26,258,Great iPad!,Olsen,5,Yes,21-Mar-19,2,0,"Slim, simple, fast, does the job...."
B07BTS2KWK,26,259,Gift for 5 year old . Durable . Just enough room,Christine,5,Yes,09-Jan-19,-,0,I got this as a gift for my five-year-old daughter for Christmas it has just enough memory for a young one to play all her games for the next five years which is how long I expect this product to last for a little kid lots of games easy on the eyes screen lots of easy to use set up function you can go into the settings menu and set up all your parental safety settings this one works only on Wi-Fi however if you have a cell phone plan that has a Wi-Fi you can share your Wi-Fi with this device it’s shockingly very durable for an Apple product and I had no problem letting her walk around with it in a simple case
B07BTS2KWK,26,260,6th Gen Perfection,MS is Home,5,Yes,27-Apr-19,1,0,"What can I say other than iPads are just the best! I’ve had a Kindle for years and I thought I loved it, but I have to say this iPad blows it out of the water! So much faster to download, videos play immediately without having to wait, the screen is so clear, and the weight of it is so much easier in my hands, even in the leather folder I purchased. So far, I am a true iPad Believer!!"
B07BTS2KWK,27,261,GreAt choice,EDG,5,Yes,18-Mar-19,1,0,I bought this to use on an overseas trip — to avoid taking my notebook. It is so light and charges from a usb unlike my notebook. Battery life is great. I’m using it more every day.
B07BTS2KWK,27,262,Good but battery life is low,Tomass P - TPX4,4,Yes,14-Dec-18,2,0,This product has been really good for the past few weeks although the battery life runs out fast but other than that this product is good!
B07BTS2KWK,27,263,I love this new ipad,Jillian,5,Yes,11-Apr-19,1,0,This was a gift for my mom to replace her old old out of date ipad! She loved it. Great product and delivered so fast! Next day delivery even though we hadn’t asked for it.
B07BTS2KWK,27,264,"Used, missing charger",Vincent Coakley,2,Yes,16-Mar-19,3,1,"Product arrived promptly.
Was (I believe) supposed to be new but was obviously (roughly) used.
Lots of scratches and dents.
Missing charger and charger cable."
B07BTS2KWK,27,265,Piece of garbage,Alexi,1,Yes,10-Mar-19,-,0,"I bought this to make my life easier, making videos and music on Garageband. One month in, I cant upload videos to youtube over 15 minutes even though I have a verified account. And in the process of helping me Apple support had me upgrade IOS. So NOW tonight, I'm getting back to my Garageband song... and guess what... no sound, all tracks grayed!

I bought Apple because I thought they would make my creative life easier. I'm thinking of going back to an 8 track recorder. At least those work."
B07BTS2KWK,27,266,You can not install any apps or software that is not from the apple store!,vonedward lee jordan,1,Yes,14-Mar-19,2,2,How can you call this a tablet if you can pick your own apps and software? Worst buy I ever made!
B07BTS2KWK,27,267,It does what it is supposed to do and does so expertly.,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,17-Jan-19,1,0,I mean- it is exactly what you would expect from Apple. The space grey isn't as dark as I would have liked but it's the same color as space grey paint from Michaels so I guess it remains true. I kind of bought this on an impulse then I realized I'm not a big fan of Apple products in general but I think it'll be semi-useful for college. It does what it is supposed to do and does it expertly.
B07BTS2KWK,27,268,Great iPad!,LSOHara,5,Yes,20-Feb-19,1,0,We have always had Android based products up until now. Bought this iPad so we could FaceTime and we could not be happier. This iPad is very easy to use and fun.
B07BTS2KWK,27,269,Wish the battery lasted longer,Claudia,5,Yes,05-Apr-19,-,0,Bought this to replace my first IPad that I bought in 2012. This one seems to work faster and because I upgraded to the 128GB I have much more room and this one costs half what I paid in 2012. Battery life isn’t any better than my old one which is why I gave it three stars as for the battery life but five overall.
B07BTS2KWK,27,270,Great product and great price!,PB from Maine,5,Yes,12-Apr-19,1,1,"So far I am very pleased with the quality and speed of this ipad. Having been a Kindle Fire user for years, I finally decided to get an iPad as I also have an iphone. Very easy to set up with iphone!"
B07BTS2KWK,28,271,Awesome Price,RobinHarmony,5,Yes,29-Mar-19,-,0,"I was super happy to get an ipad at this price, and am very happy with what I received. It works great. There are more things I can do on my ipad than I could on my iPhone but honestly not that much more. I wouldn't say this is necessary if you already have an iPhone, but if you want a bigger screen and have some money to spend then why not."
B07BTS2KWK,28,272,Best Tablet,Louis S,5,Yes,27-Jan-19,-,0,"The Apple iPad is expensive, however, it is reliable. I have one of the very first iPads which I use daily to watch TV, play app games, do my online banking, etc. I purchased this iPad for my Grandson, who had a 1st generation iPad for years and he is very pleased with it and the new features available on it. I wish I could be technical in my review, but I am not of the ""computer"" generation."
B07BTS2KWK,28,273,Very good,Joshnjada,5,Yes,12-Jan-19,1,0,Bought this as a gift for my daughter who is 10 years old .. for Christmas 2018 she is absolutely amazed and love this can’t stop thanking me for getting her this. This iPad is fast enough and very attractive I love it
B07BTS2KWK,28,274,"Super for watching video, reading and auto-syncing with my phone.",John T,5,Yes,19-Mar-19,-,0,"I use the iPad for reading news subscriptions & email watching video (i.e. Netflix etc.) and some web surfing. The display is especially bright and clear. I also like the fact that I can auto-sync the calendar, contacts, email etc. with my iPhone. I'm very happy with my Apple iPad (Wi-Fi, 32GB) and use it daily."
B07BTS2KWK,28,275,Pleased with purchase:),beth,5,Yes,01-Feb-19,-,0,"This is my second ipad that I've owned.....This Ipad seems to have more features than my first....I had problems scrolling on my old ipad but this one works perfectly! I'm still getting use to it...I've only had it a few days ….I'm not ""technology savy"" but I enjoy learning how to use it's features:) So far, happy with the purchase....!"
B07BTS2KWK,28,276,Price Range of $250.00,Seung Lee,4,Yes,30-Mar-19,-,0,"For $250.00 price range for the most recent updated Apple Ipad, it is very good deal. I don't really use a tablet as I favored Google Chrome based convertible laptops. The Ipad was a gift for my wife and she is so happy about Rose Gold aluminium back and superior built quality of the tablet. The screen is very beautiful too and Im happy about my purchase at the price range of $250.00."
B07BTS2KWK,28,277,Great tablet,Hugh vaughan,5,Yes,04-Apr-19,-,0,"I have been using an IPad as my laptop/computer/presentation device in my line of work for about 7 years now, and I love them. This is my second one. My first was a first gen. And it still works. It’s lightning fast and has much more storage than my old gen 1. I’m happy with the purchase, and I highly recommend it."
B07BTS2KWK,28,278,"Great deal, fine product",Nancy J. Stevenson,5,Yes,17-Nov-18,2,0,"easy to use, dependable. Thank you!"
B07BTS2KWK,28,279,"Amazing screen, fast & easy user interface & solid feel to it.",Heather,5,Yes,05-Mar-19,1,0,"Bought this to replace my iPad mini which was sluggish & outdated. Very happy with the size as it’s a big change from the smaller screen on the mini. Been an Apple customer for 10 years or so, so unboxing & set up was a breeze. Much faster & more GB, I’m very happy with my purchase thus far & for $250 ($90 more than a refurbished iPad Mini @ Walmart) you can’t really go wrong."
B07BTS2KWK,28,280,Get someone to teach you correctly before you use it,Kindle Customer,3,Yes,06-Feb-19,1,0,This is a product I bought to use while I was in the hospital for two months I just could not get the hang of it so I use my Kindle instead one time when I have more time I'll have someone teach me how to use it but for now it's just sitting on my desk
B07BTS2KWK,29,281,Different from Android tablet,Papa H.,5,Yes,16-Feb-19,-,1,"I new that going with a iPad, it would be different. I had a little of a learning curve. The home button is on the tablet and not the screen. Microsoft office works fine and so does Companion Link . Once that I learned that iTunes does all of the file/music/picture transfer, it was a piece of cake."
B07BTS2KWK,29,282,iPad 6. I think?!,Megan,5,Yes,25-Feb-19,-,0,"Gorgeous. This is an actual Apple product, not sure why they don’t just say which iPad it is but it appears to be the 6. I’m not an expert but I still love it and it’s worth the price. The gold is beautiful because I’m extra like that. I just wish I could have known which it was first off to purchase the correct case."
B07BTS2KWK,29,283,Out of the box and Go,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,29-Mar-19,-,0,"I have tried and returned a few 2-1's while trying to find something light to travel with for our small business. I have never been a huge Chromebook fan and 3 years ago made the switch from Android to Apple. I decided to get this along with a keyboard since it would mirror my Iphone 7 (sometimes just too small for what I want). I opened the box, set it up and away we went. Everything updated and downloaded seamlessly. It is clear and the quality is good. I used it to watch a movie last night as well and found the speakers to be satisfactory. Picture was very good. I am waiting on the keyboard to arrive and I believe I will be able to do exactly what I want with ease and less costly than Pro."
B07BTS2KWK,29,284,"iPad great, Amazon disappointed me.",Jeannette,5,Yes,17-Mar-19,-,1,iPad is wonderful. Love Apple devices. They connect to each other easily and setup is a breeze. But Amazon let me down. Purchase was to be in 12 interest free payments. Amazon charged full price. Customer service agreed to refund full price then recharge correctly. Never happened. Disappointed in customer service staff
B07BTS2KWK,29,285,Great product and fast enough for all but a power user,whitejww,5,Yes,19-Dec-18,-,0,I was undecided on purchasing an iPad Pro or the 2018 iPad. I purchased the 2018 iPad and I am not disappointed in my decision. It’s a speedy little unit and was easily able to load all the familiar applications I use on my iPhone X. It streams movies with ease and does everything one could want for the day to day use.
B07BTS2KWK,29,286,2018 Ipad,ML1980,5,Yes,21-Feb-19,-,0,"I absolutely love this Ipad! I’ve been watching youtube videos for months and heard mixed reviews regarding it but everything about it i love, I have no problems whatsoever. Would highly recommend this product and also this company. Fast shipping and everything was intact and the ipad is beautiful! &#55358;&#56688;"
B07BTS2KWK,29,287,"Great iPad, very good deal.",Sandra E. Rivkin,5,Yes,09-Mar-19,-,0,"iPad arrived on time in perfect condition. Turned on with my old iPad on next to it and the rest is a happy history. Loaded all data and apps automatically including internet and has been working flawlessly. Ordered the case too which was perfect. This is an excellent iPad and price is great. Apple did a smart thing by releasing an affordable device.
-Sandy"
B07BTS2KWK,29,288,GOOD iPad,Amazon Customer,3,Yes,07-Mar-19,-,0,"I received a box with the IPad and a cord that didn’t work. No paperwork or anything. I did buy a GOOD model but I thought it came with some kind of documents.
Once I charged it with my iPad cord it was fine.
Plan to use for editing a few documents and to use instead of iPhone for internet."
B07BTS2KWK,29,289,Amazing how far iPad has come,Chris,5,Yes,09-Jan-19,-,0,I purchased the first iPad the weekend it came out in 2010. To think how far it's come in that time is amazing. I got this iPad on sale right before Christmas and it's amazing how much less this iteration was compared to the original. The screen is vibrant and it's super light. Great buy at sub $300!
B07BTS2KWK,29,290,Very good but only runs 64bit APPs,Charlotte Echelberger,4,Yes,28-Jan-19,1,0,"I like the device but I have a 4th gen and the new iPads only run 64bit APPS and all my 4th gen APPs with data/files/photos won't work and can't be transferred. On this new 6th Gen by doing what I said does more to point you to the Apple store to buy more. My own videos and music I couldn't load into the new one, and a folder I have of Audiobooks won't transfer to new 6th. I'm returning it to Amazon for those reasons and not that it isn't a good device"
B07BTS2KWK,30,291,Wonderful!,P,5,Yes,25-Feb-19,-,0,"My moms old ipad stopped working after I years the screen was super slow to respond and the device itself was super laugh and slow as well so i got her an upgrade and she loves it! She's so happy she got it and she noticed a differencd in it. We also got the warranty plan, better to be safe than sorry"
B07BTS2KWK,30,292,This was a gift for my husband,AW,5,Yes,10-Oct-18,2,0,"I gave the Apple IPad 6th generation to my husband as a gift, and he loves it. This replaced his old one. He especially likes the camera, the quality of the pictures are much nicer."
B07BTS2KWK,30,293,Replaced my iPad 3 with the 6th Generation,DP,5,Yes,02-Feb-19,-,0,"I replaced my iPad 3 and can tell a big difference in speed, size and weight. The iPad is a good size and very light weight. It is easy to setup. It seems the battery life is not quite what it was on the older versions but it is fine. I have enjoyed using it with no complains after a month."
B07BTS2KWK,30,294,Great iPad,Retired and Traveling,5,Yes,17-Apr-19,-,0,I use this just like a computer. I get my email on and and I put a Kindle app on it and can also read my books too. I can compose documents using Word and Outlook. This is a great iPad! I almost wish I had bought the one with cell phone capability so everything would go in one.
B07BTS2KWK,30,295,Nice Upgrade,Grandaddy A,5,Yes,26-Jan-19,-,0,"I used an iPad 2 since shortly after they were first produced. If this one lasts as long, I will be greatly pleased. I've had to adjust to the changes in the operating system and some of the apps but I am becoming more accustomed each week. I appreciate the increased speed and greater reliability of the OS."
B07BTS2KWK,30,296,Okay Its an iPad 6,Dr.Seuss,5,Yes,27-Dec-18,-,0,"Yup, that's what it is. Apple still make the nicest iPads, good to see some lower cost offerings coming to market. The product came in as new, complete with shrink wrap seal. Works very well, without issue. Shipping was fast, and the product very well packaged. Recommend the iPad. Recommend the seller. Thank you."
B07BTS2KWK,30,297,My Daughter Loves it. Very good learning tool.,Charles Hud Rannenberg,5,Yes,07-Feb-19,2,0,Apple is the only way to go. Best!
B07BTS2KWK,30,298,If you are a casual user like me. Save money and just buy this.,Mir,5,Yes,24-Mar-19,-,1,Dude for my needs this is an awesome price. I watch movies on it. Casual web browsing. YouTube while I cook. Check email. If you really don't need to do more than that... And you want the Apple dependability... And not worry that your tablet will be obsolete in 3 years. Buy this.
B07BTS2KWK,30,299,Great IPad,rosemary Mckeever,5,Yes,19-Mar-19,-,1,"This IPad is my baby.
I went with it over the Pro cause it had more weight & isn't paper thin. I shake too much for something flimsy/thin.
The screen view is nice, it's kinda touchy/sensitive when typing & you get double letters a lot, was priced right & delivered overnight."
B07BTS2KWK,30,300,Won’t find a better price!,NurseSherry,5,Yes,25-Dec-18,-,0,I purchased this for my son for Christmas. He likes to play fortnite. Now he has his own iPad and can leave mine alone. He played with it for almost 6 hours straight until it was time for him to go back to his mothers house. I searched around and this is definitely the cheapest price for this peticular iPad.
B07BTS2KWK,31,301,Ooooo Weeee I'm in love,Samiyah,5,Yes,28-Feb-19,-,0,I have successfully avoided the tablet craze for years now. As phone screen specs are increasing I felt owning a tablet was a bit redundant. I was wrong. The battery life is beautiful. Better than my iPhone at this point. I am very happy with my purchase. Pro Tip: Get apple care. The amenities are well worth it.
B07BTS2KWK,31,302,iPad for my son!!,Pranay kr,5,Yes,20-Feb-19,1,0,"Wanted to buy a tab for my 7 year old and being an apple fan it was not very difficult, made sure that I get an nice number case along with it."
B07BTS2KWK,31,303,Disappointed..,Rei,1,Yes,27-Mar-19,1,0,I was exited to open this brand new iPad. I finished set up and put protection film. It looked something weird...I realized that there was a protection film already on it!! It was wrapped like a brand new. But it is obviously open box product. I returned it and ordered replacement. I hope It will not happen again..
B07BTS2KWK,31,304,"It's light Weight, perfect size",Seymour,4,Yes,14-Dec-18,1,0,"I sure It will be better when I get to know it better. I have issues in getting my contact transferred from an android phone.
Other than user issues it great."
B07BTS2KWK,31,305,It does the trick as an entry iPad,Austin Kenworthy,4,Yes,21-Mar-19,2,0,It looks nice. Wish MS Office could be on it from the start. I understand why not but Numbers vs Excel is a big difference
B07BTS2KWK,31,306,Perfect for entertainment purpose,Billie,5,Yes,24-Jan-19,-,0,"Second iPad. Perfect for entertainment purpose.
Had no issue with the first one for 4 years. Give it to elderlies in the family and upgraded to this one.
32GB is more than enough for Netflix, Youtube, etc. The iPad pro is overpriced. Get this one if you are only going to use it as streaming tablet."
B07BTS2KWK,31,307,It locked me out,Katie,1,Yes,07-Mar-19,2,0,"I got it as a gift, the first time i went to turn it off it locked me out. When I put my passcode in it got disabled. The minute later turned in to an hour. After the hour was up, another hour restarted for no reason. I returned it and am awaiting my refund."
B07BTS2KWK,31,308,Apple only apple,Maykel Vargas Gutierrez,5,Yes,08-Oct-18,3,0,"Excellent Tablet, Works great"
B07BTS2KWK,31,309,Great Christmas gift. Awesome tablet!,Brittany,5,Yes,25-Mar-19,-,0,"I bought this for my 8 year old son for Christmas. It's been 3 months now and he and I are both loving it! We went from a samsung galaxy tab a that he had for about 2 years and it was just on its way out. I love android and have always had the Samsung galaxy phones and still do. This was my first apple purchase. Battery life is great and it's never slow and he uses it for youtube, minecraft, and doing screen recording game plays. Very happy!"
B07BTS2KWK,31,310,love it but not usb c,Bob Y!%,4,Yes,30-Apr-19,1,0,"I love this version of ipad, high quality as before :). The only disadvantage is missing usb c. I have upgraded all my devices to usb c and this is the only one left without usb c but I don't want to spend additional money for ipad pro. overall, this is a good buy."
B07BTS2KWK,32,311,It’s an Apple,Larry Rizzitano,5,Yes,30-Apr-19,-,0,"As with all products Apple offers, it’s excellent. And, as with all Apple products, I feel as the newest model comes out the older one starts to slow down. My last iPad lasted about 3 years before it became so slow I stopped using it. I bought this at great rate because Amazon."
B07BTS2KWK,32,312,Apple tablet is great,jokam,5,Yes,04-Mar-19,-,0,"This replaced a Nexus, which was corrupted when I got it, but didn’t know it. Amazon was great at refunding the price I paid. I decided to go for the Apple because my grandkids have them & they never had a problem. I am totally satisfied with the quality of this tablet."
B07BTS2KWK,32,313,Everything is perfect nothing to worries about thank you Amazon love you!!,Marín,5,Yes,12-Jan-19,-,0,Omg i just cant believe what i got my new IPad just love it so much. To bad when i order it i didn't saw that there was a 128GB and i got an 32GB . i wish i had the 128gb instead of the 32gb because I'm using a lot of space for what i do. But yeah i recommend this product by Amazon.
B07BTS2KWK,32,314,May convert me over to Apple from Android,Fellow Amazon Customer,5,Yes,05-Jan-19,1,0,Have never been an Apple fan but I really do like this iPad. Works great with Google Project Fi cellular mobile network
B07BTS2KWK,32,315,Met if not exceeds expectations,S.G.D,5,Yes,14-Apr-19,-,0,"I've always been a Samsung person, but for a tablet (one I want to put educational apps on) I wanted the best and got a good black Friday deal. What surprises me most is the battery life. It has me considering switching to an apple phone one my Gakaxy goes."
B07BTS2KWK,32,316,Great price,troy o,5,Yes,10-Nov-18,2,0,Love it
B07BTS2KWK,32,317,Feels cheap,Agteyiiccvjk,3,Yes,30-Apr-19,-,0,"I have an iPad 1st gen, and an iPad Pro. Compared to those 2, this iPad just feels cheap. To me, it feels very plasticy, like I could bend it in half. If you can get it on sale and need a bigger screen, then buy it, but I’m not crazy about the feel of it."
B07BTS2KWK,32,318,Great traveling companion.,JJS,5,Yes,07-Feb-19,1,0,Outstanding screen resolution. Easy to use. Happy with its versatility and the number of apps available.
B07BTS2KWK,32,319,Durability issues,Carol,4,Yes,11-Jan-19,-,0,This is an upgrade from a iPad mini and have had it less than two months. Dropped it on carpeted floor and cracked the screen. Very disappointed in durability. Don't know if this is something that can be fixed. Live in a rural area so repair might pose a problem.
B07BTS2KWK,32,320,Stay close to your charging cable.,Michael J. Lehner,5,Yes,14-Mar-19,-,1,"Everything is great but thank goodness I have a charging cable right here. I’m down to 25% and I’m going to have to plug it in soon. It has one battery life, my Apple Watch has another and my iPhone has yet another. It gets old pretty quickly. Everything else is great."
B07BTS2KWK,33,321,Brand new,5 stars,5,Yes,30-Mar-19,-,0,"The best price for a wonderful ipad. Fast shipping too.
Everything came brand new in sealed apple box. Everything works great. Thanks for the price. ( too bad Bermont, has become a tax state with Amazon. Little by little, they drain the worker."
B07BTS2KWK,33,322,headphone jack,Speerdo,1,Yes,24-Feb-19,-,0,QC issues galore. The headphone jack just randomly stops working with a portable speaker we purchased. In every occasion I switch to my Android device and it starts working instantly. Apple has really fallen off the cliff when it comes to quality and reliability.
B07BTS2KWK,33,323,Not new ! Refurbished,Gigi,1,Yes,22-Feb-19,3,1,"Dont purchase, they’re not new"
B07BTS2KWK,33,324,Terrific device,RandomPennsylvanian,5,Yes,20-Feb-19,-,0,"I did not care for Apple computers back in the 80s and 90s and continued to avoid the cult of Apple. After buying this iPad for work purposes (I keep telling myself) however, I must say I have been an ass. Jumping into the proprietary universe of the red fruit was ultra smooth out of the box. Elegant. Fast. So far in - a few days only - I am very impressed."
B07BTS2KWK,33,325,GREAT IPAD,Todd W. Swenson,4,Yes,14-Jan-19,-,0,"I bought this for my wife for a Christmas present. I got a little nervous when it arrived at my place
in badly ripped cardboard box with minimal inside package material, but the Apple box was untouched,
and the IPAD functioned perfectly right away. after doing some research about Apple's new IPAD products
for 2018, this one seemed the best for my wife's needs. so far, so good..."
B07BTS2KWK,33,326,Love my iPad.,Barbra,5,Yes,19-Feb-19,1,0,This iPad replaced an iPad Air that I have been using for about 6 years. It is very similar to that one.
B07BTS2KWK,33,327,Arrived INTACT and ON-Time.,Stephen,5,Yes,28-Sep-18,1,0,"This device arrived INTACT and ON-Time. I don't know what we will use it for, however, it will help my wife get used to it as that is what they will be moving to at her work. Thank you TEAM!"
B07BTS2KWK,33,328,I LOVE MY IPAD,Norma Banas,5,Yes,26-Dec-18,-,0,"This is the third iPad I have owned and so far the best. It is fast, easy to use, does everything I need. I enjoy music at night, easily get my email, can watch Netflix and others, read books all day and do great mind games. It does everything."
B07BTS2KWK,33,329,Very happy with Apple iPad 2018 model purchase.,Shell B,5,Yes,26-Sep-18,2,0,Love it. So much faster and lighter than my iPad 2. Beautiful picture. So much storage. Very happy with purchase. Amazon matched price of competitor.
B07BTS2KWK,33,330,"iPad is great, charger was junk.",Amazon Customer,5,Yes,18-Feb-19,-,0,"While the iPad works great, the charger piece (the tiny metal end) literally snapped off after 2 weeks IN my iPad... I had to use tweezers to get it out. Super bummed about it. I was able to get it out though and am using my phone charger to charge it. Seems pretty janky if that happened after only 2 weeks of use..."
B07BTS2KWK,34,331,Good Buy.,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,12-Feb-19,-,0,My IPad was just as promised. Everything came fine. Came in the box with a charger and everything.Was using it for about a week now and everything is A okay. The battery lasts a long time. The camera quality is not as good as I expected but that would not be the fault of the seller and of Apple themselves. It isn’t bad it is just because this is the 2018 IPad I expected a slightly better quality. I have no problems at all with it.
B07BTS2KWK,34,332,We really like this iPad over the tablet we have used,jaqk,4,Yes,23-Jan-19,-,0,"This is our first time using apple products and we a really like using this product. We have used a tablet in the past and this iPad blows that tablet away. It is faster, bigger screen with better clarity, faster processor and on and on. The ipad is better in everyway and the delivery was smooth with no glitches in delivery or in the product. Now we are considering changing to the iPhone."
B07BTS2KWK,34,333,Great product... Apple has a lot of fineprint*,Sweetheartinkd,5,Yes,05-Mar-19,-,1,I love the iPad for what it is and the picture quality was great and music sounded good just as is on its own speakers. I returned mine only because I didnt realize Apple charges for next to everything to be used on their products. I wanted to download an app from the app store and had to enter my debit card info then got charged for itunes that I dont even use or even accessed the itunes app when using my debit card to get the app I actually wanted. Just seems too costly and a hassle to customize it with what I actually use day to day. But great product in itself.
B07BTS2KWK,34,334,Great Product!,Mongoose,5,Yes,10-Jan-19,-,0,"I bought this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it! That says it all to me because she has a Kindle that is a few years old, but she says this thing kicks butt over the Kindle. She also says the battery life is unbelievable. She can't speak highly enough about this item."
B07BTS2KWK,34,335,Great iPad That Was On Sale,JRG,5,Yes,11-Mar-19,-,0,"I’m very happy with my iPad for the price I paid for it, it was on sale through Amazon and Walmart. I’ve only been using it for a little more than two months, so I can’t speak as to longevity. Does everything very quickly the screen is very nice."
B07BTS2KWK,34,336,"Um... Love It, Love It, Love It!",Jacinda,5,Yes,22-Mar-19,1,0,What else can I say than I love my iPad. The ease of setting it up and using it is top-notch.
B07BTS2KWK,34,337,Pro capability at a budget price,Israel S.,5,Yes,20-Mar-19,1,0,"I can't believe this iPad was as cheap as it was. It has a great looking screen, awesome battery life and works with the Apple Pencil (1st Gen)."
B07BTS2KWK,34,338,Loving this new iPad,Manorman,5,Yes,01-Mar-19,-,0,"I have an old iPad 2 Air that I used daily. When it started to not charge well, I took it to be repaired, but unless I sent it back to Apple to have the lightening charge port soldered, the charging seemed iffy. So... after much debate, I bought this sweet item. Transferring everything over to the new one took some patience, yet I am so glad I got this newer, faster, more RAM device. I just wish Apple still made 64 RAM on the simple iPad. I don’t need an iPad Pro. This will work perfectly."
B07BTS2KWK,34,339,Best Buy,Kevin,5,Yes,04-Apr-19,1,0,"At first, I doubted it would be a brand new iPad.You know what It is brand new with first character M serial Number and one year hardwares apple warranty . Great .... would recommend it"
B07BTS2KWK,34,340,Don’t worry,M. Jaeger,5,Yes,10-Apr-19,-,0,"If you are on the fence about buying this 6th generation iPad because you think it might be a refurbished model you, can rest assured. The 128gb pad I got for my wife was new and a delight to use. We wanted to replace an older model and migrating all of our settings was a breeze. VERY HAPPY."
B07BTS2KWK,35,341,good product,Charles J.,5,Yes,20-Mar-19,-,0,"for the money and the function this tablet is great. You can pay a lot more for other tablets but why would you want to unless using it for your livelihood. This is a fast and reliable, quick charging tool that is just perfect for what it was designed to do."
B07BTS2KWK,35,342,Much improved from my earlier model,Munz,5,Yes,12-Jan-19,-,0,It appears to have superior security features and operating speed. Most operations are similar to the earlier model. Downloading of the OS uses a lot of space and my ISP (via satellite) limits my monthly transfer access severely. A second version of the OS was issued shortly after the first.
B07BTS2KWK,35,343,Superb tablet for the price,Ashley Raweewonrungjumrus,5,Yes,30-Apr-19,-,0,"I’ve owned android tablets in the past and bought my first iPad, and this is an EXCELLENT tablet. Especially the base 32gb 9.7 tablet which is available brand new at $250! The tablet is smooth and performs incredibly well. It doesn’t have all the poor app optimization that my past Android tablets have along with OS that never went updated. For phones I’ll always stick with Android, but for tablets I have to pick iOS as a clear winner."
B07BTS2KWK,35,344,Another homerun for apple,Ryan,5,Yes,10-Jan-19,-,0,"The listing is legit, this is the latest ipad, everything you should expect from apple. 5/5 stars, battery life is only 10 hours if you have the brightness down but you can expect to get 6-7 hours of normal use ( I use it for YouTube, social networking, music, games, etc.) don’t know about serious workloads like editing or drawing/drafting. Great product for a great price, haven’t found one for cheaper."
B07BTS2KWK,35,345,Wonderful!,flyingscot4,5,Yes,16-Mar-19,-,0,"I have spent a lot of money on other tablets because I thought that iPad were too expensive. I was wrong! I use it for everything! I am sorry that I didn't buy one with more memory, but I can still use my others for some things. Love Apple!"
B07BTS2KWK,35,346,The Best for Less!,FreerHuguenot,5,Yes,10-Mar-19,-,0,The best tablet for the money. I still have an iPad2 that although limited by its iOS operating system still works like a champ - now on its 3rd grandkid. People that I know who bought other tablets other than iPads that long ago have been relegated to the trash long ago.
B07BTS2KWK,35,347,Do NOT buy iPad from Amazon,S. Gore,1,Yes,27-Mar-19,1,0,I should have heeded the reviews and not purchased this through Amazon. I bought it 5 days ago and the power button already stopped working. It would have been worth the extra money to just buy it from Apple.
B07BTS2KWK,35,348,All was fine,Michael Gottlieb,5,Yes,01-Nov-18,3,0,"Product arrived on time with all the promised specs.
Very satisfied."
B07BTS2KWK,35,349,Worth the buy and very pleased ??,SK3,5,Yes,15-Jan-19,1,0,"It met expectations. It replaced my IPad 2 and it works lovely. It’s lighter and more compact. The price is nice, too."
B07BTS2KWK,35,350,Best tablet for recreational use,K.M.,5,Yes,28-Nov-18,1,0,Best tablet i've ever bought. All the apps work as it should for recreational use. Not recommended for productivity work.
B07BTS2KWK,36,351,Great Tablet,Groversmom,5,Yes,27-Apr-19,1,0,"This was gift and my husband loves it! He likes the size of the tablet and the quality of the screen images. He's still in the process of adding apps, etc. but uses it every day."
B07BTS2KWK,36,352,Improved Screen,Michael Lawson,5,Yes,07-Mar-19,-,0,"This is my third iPad my iPad Air 32gb was slow running some apps, Udemy in particular which I use a lot. I bought the 128gb version this time which should be enough for downloading content while traveling. The screen is greatly improved over the original iPad Air much sharper picture. It’s also nice to have the touch sensor and I’m glad they left the headphone jack. Overall a great upgrade and the $100 off clinched the deal."
B07BTS2KWK,36,353,Ipad,Fran,1,Yes,22-Apr-19,-,1,I received this product on Friday. Waited until Sat to set it up. Less than 24 hours later it quit working. Went to the Apple store where it was reset. Then less than 24 hours it again quit working. Meaning black screen with a round thing going around constantly and you couldn't shut it off or hard reset it. Went back to the apple store again. They ordered me a new iPad . I know people get lemons but it is so frustrating .
B07BTS2KWK,36,354,I use it a lot more than i thought i would,J and J,5,Yes,12-Feb-19,-,0,So much better than using a phone in the evenings. I wish it had a volume on/off switch though. You can load your phone back up to an ipad. Speaker calls on this (redirected from your phone) are much better than the phone too.
B07BTS2KWK,36,355,So far so good,Summer,5,Yes,10-Feb-19,-,0,Just got it but I like it so far. It took a couple tries to set it up because it wouldn’t connect to my iTunes. But other that it’s just what I wanted. It’s just like an iPhone but bigger. Great for reading books on. Very happy with my purchase.
B07BTS2KWK,36,356,Fantastic iPad,Zoey,5,Yes,07-Apr-19,-,0,"There’s nothing I dislike about this. I like it better than my android.
I had an older ipad3 and is like another world for me.
After learning it, it’s totally amazing.
The graphics are wonderful. Being able to change text to larger and bolder was a thrilling find for me."
B07BTS2KWK,36,357,Love Amazon,Nerak,5,Yes,11-Dec-18,1,0,Amazon price was as low as ‘Black Friday ‘ deal that I tried to get at Jet app but couldn’t get through
B07BTS2KWK,36,358,Life Saver,Nicole S.,5,Yes,16-Mar-19,1,0,"This is my first iPad, crazy...I know. I am sooo thankful for this portable and functional laptop substitute. Love everything about this and is the only “computer” i need at home. I suggest getting a keyboard for it from Amazon too!"
B07BTS2KWK,36,359,Apple iPad,Brenda Z,5,Yes,15-Nov-18,3,0,Apple iPad delivers all that is promised and more. Reliable product!
B07BTS2KWK,36,360,Awesome!,Rupert T,5,Yes,29-Dec-18,1,0,Works great! Haven't seen my husband in weeks lol :D Highly recommended!!
B07BTS2KWK,37,361,Won’t charge! Not new model!,Ashley Lewis,2,Yes,31-Dec-18,1,1,"Amazon presented this as the newest model but it’s not. It won’t charge, right out of the box. Going to return it!"
B07BTS2KWK,37,362,Tablet para la U,Javier Arévalo Soberón,5,Yes,02-Dec-18,7,0,"No soy muy fan de apple, pero esta compra te aseguro que fue la mejor. Decidí comprar el ipad para la Universidad para evitar llevar miles de libros. El precio fue increible para ese momento. Una tablet de esta calidad por solo $250(black friday), sin duda una oferta que no pude dejar pasar. El producto, esta ayudando muchisimo en los estudios y a evitar llevar muchos libros. Es una muy buena opcion ai es lo que buscas."
B07BTS2KWK,37,363,Who else bought this on black friday?,Wei M.,5,Yes,07-Dec-18,-,0,"Well, I am very happy with my purchase. Nothing wrong with the ipad.
However, I like how the seller got my with that ""save $150 black friday deal"" and now it only cost $10 more then I originally paid for XD.
Honestly a smart marketing tactic."
B07BTS2KWK,37,364,Not too good to be true!,Taylor,5,Yes,16-Apr-19,1,0,"I was skeptical as I’m sure most others were when seeing a “too good to be true” post for $50 off an iPad but I have had it for several months and it’s worked perfectly. It was brand new and in perfect condition and has held up with daily use in streaming and playing games, as well as surfing the web. Would definitely recommend."
B07BTS2KWK,37,365,Recommend,elizabeth,5,Yes,29-Apr-19,-,0,"Received the item very fast and in excellent condition. Received in a sealed container which sometimes doesn’t happen with amazon.

B07BTS2KWK,37,366,This is my first iPad and I love it!,Hammons,5,Yes,29-Jan-19,-,0,I bought this iPad for a couple of reasons.

HOWEVER… a few of the apps originally created for cellular devices like (Facebook, Instagram, etc) ARE UNABLE to be viewed in full screen. Meaning it only shows in the middle of the screen with two large black spaces to the left and right of the screen (even if you hit the arrows to extend the screen) the reason I did not take off a Star for this is because I googled the issue, it’s way more common then I thought, & no one seems to know if it’s an Apple issue or App issue. But since it’s happening with multiple apps i say it’s DEFINITELY APPLE’s ISSUE"
B07BTS2KWK,37,369,Perfect ipad,Dima,5,Yes,08-Feb-19,1,0,"This ipad is perfect. New from apple, battery lasts a long time, and super fast.

B07BTS2KWK,38,374,Great overall product for most people.,Chris Diana-peebles,5,Yes,30-Nov-18,1,0,My mom is having a blast with this thing.

B07BTS2KWK,38,375,Great price! Great device!,Frank S,5,Yes,04-Jan-19,1,0,"Arrived on time, well-packaged and as ordered. Have used it for about a month, so can’t say much more but I’ve been a avid apple user, and have only had problems with their phones"

I am in school and need something bigger than the mini but smaller than my laptop for traveling. This worker great on my trip and I am glad I bought it at an excellent price. Honestly I’d like it a little larger but with the keyboard I bought it’s been great. I would definitely recommend if you’re on the fence and if you’ve never owned an iPad you will not be disappointed.
B07BTS2KWK,42,411,Best Tablet I've Had,Courtney Lancaster,5,Yes,22-Mar-19,1,0,Best tablet and with a great price as well. The fluidity of use between my other Apple products is awesome.

Brown,5,Yes,27-Dec-18,-,0,It is much faster and lighter than my Ipad4 and with the 128 GB memory you don't have to worry too much about keeping digits!

Somehow the product got entirely locked up and I had to spend over an hour doing a factory reset on it. I do not think I will be buying another apple product again.
B07BTS2KWK,238,2375,My 3rd iPad--No Regrets,Russell Robinson,5,-,24-Nov-18,7,2,"This is the 3rd iPad I've owned since they were first created. I gave my first iPad to one of my kids, and upgraded to the iPad Air 2 with LTE. I used it for about a year, and noticed I wasn't using it all that much--so instead of upgrading it, I gave it to another of my kids. A few months later, I realized I missed having an iPad!

So I bought the 6th-gen Wi-Fi iPad, not the LTE version. Having owned the LTE iPad, I know I rarely used the LTE capability. Also, the 128GB is the sweet-spot for storage in my opinion. Now that I have an iPad again, I can comfortably read my e-books (my iPhone was just too small for that). This iPad has the ""guts"" of the iPhone 7, so it's nice and quick. I also like that it's compatible with the Apple Pencil, and am thinking of getting one. I prefer watching YouTube videos on the iPad screen as opposed to my iPhone--its easier to ""see"". The camera isn't anything to write home about, but I don't do photography on iPad anyway--so it's not a big deal.

If you're in the market for a great iPad, but don't need all the fancy features the ""Pro"" series provides, you'll be happy with the 128GB 6th-gen iPad."

B07BTS2KWK,238,2377,"HERE ARE ALL THE MODEL NUMBERS FOR THIS 9.7"" 6th GENERATION (2018) iPAD",Peter K.,5,-,27-Mar-19,5,0,"I've seen a lot of questions about the model numbers and what generation this iPad is. Not sure why Amazon didn't clearly state these. I'll do that for you here:

Yes, this is the latest 9.7"" iPad (as of March 27, 2019), also known as the 6th generation or 2018 model. Model numbers differ between the WiFi-only version and the Cellular (LTE)+WiFi version and can be found etched on the back. Here goes:

The model # for the WiFi-only 9.7"" 6th generation 2018 iPad = A1893
The model # for the Cellular (LTE)+WiFi 9.7"" 6th generation 2018 iPad = A1954

These are the generic model numbers for these groups of iPads and don't take into account storage space (32GB or 128GB) or color (Space Gray, Silver, Gold). If you drill down to those details there are even more specific model numbers:

WiFi-only, 32 GB models...

Space Gray (Black Front) model = MR7F2LL/A
Silver (White Front) model = MR7G2LL/A
Gold (White Front) model = MRJN2LL/A

WiFi-only, 128 GB models...

Space Gray (Black Front) model = MR7J2LL/A
Silver (White Front) model = MR7K2LL/A
Gold (White Front) model = MRJP2LL/A

There are also specific model numbers for the Cellular (LTE)+WiFi iPads but they vary depending on cellular carrier (Verizon, AT&T, etc.) so I'm not going to get into them here. Go to BestBuy.com though and you'll find all the model numbers there for all the variations of storage space, color, and connection type.

If you're just looking to buy a case that fits, etc., you'll only need the first model numbers (A1893, A1954).

Hope this helps, saw a lot of questions and varied answers so thought I'd type this out!"

Extremely unhappy with Apple pricing, and have bought my last iPhone until the company stops gouging ($1,000+ for a cell phone? Really? Not this sucker.)
That said, we're very pleased with the new iPad. Still a little spendy, but don't feel sexually abused by the price. However, these two will be our last, since it appears we're going to have to migrate to Android next go-round because of Apple's unreasonable pricing on phones."
B07BTS2KWK,238,2379,This may be all you need,Jermaine Stewart,4,-,11-Dec-18,3,0,"The biggest thing about this 6th gen iPad is the support for the 1st gen Apple pencil. If you just need a tablet for reading (internet, kindle, etc) and streaming video, then the 32GB model is good enough. I got the 128GB model for times when I want to download videos (netflix, etc.) when traveling and don't have access to wifi. I had the 2nd and 3rd gen iPad prior to getting this one. The faster processor, faster refresh rate, better screen, and better design of the Apple pencil would be a reason to get the Pro model, but this model adequately gets the job done. My iPad 3 was getting super slow at browsing websites, especially Amazon. I mostly use this for reading, especially manga, and watching videos. Battery life is great. I'll likely get the Apple pencil to do some note and sketch work. The reviews I've seen from artists show that sketching won't be a problem. I wished the rotation lock switch was still here, but the option is still in the menu."

B07BTS2KWK,239,2382,Something seems off ???????,maegan,1,-,07-Dec-18,8,3,Must be a next gen iPad not even Apple carries. Specs say A10 chip when Apples site has A8 chip kinda strange.
B07BTS2KWK,239,2383,Best Ipad for the price,N. S.,5,-,05-Dec-18,1,0,"I bought this Ipad brand new on Black Friday due to the great deal of $250.00 which is the best deal I think out there on the market right now. I own a Ipad Air 2 which I love but I wanted to be able to use the Apple Pencil and the Ipad Air 2 doesn’t support that. This ipad is almost identical in all the specs the Ipad Air 2 has but better due to the more powerful A10 fusion chip. I thought about buying the Ipad Pro but I didn’t want to fork out a lot of money especially when I can spend less and I am still able to use the Apple Pencil. Of course there are people out there that will say the Ipad Pro is better for using the pencil versus the Ipad 2018 but no enough to make a huge difference. 32GB storage is the minimum I would buy an ipad with. I don’t need the 128GB of storage (I use the cloud or my macbook to store pictures and video, also google photos stores endless amounts of photos and videos so you don’t need the extra storage. I tested both ipads out and found that there was no wasn’t anything totally outstanding or more beneficial with the Pro that would make me change my mind. I recommend this ipad to anyone especially for the price point, and its capabilities."
B07BTS2KWK,239,2384,Exceeded my expectations,Blanche De Marco,5,-,01-May-19,1,0,"I was a little bit hesitant to buy it here because I normally buy all our apple products at the Apple Store but I bought this one as a gift to a friend. Surprisingly , it’s all brand new, a real apple product and it exceeded my expectations.

I’ve read that some people are a little baffled. To eliminate some confusion, “iPad Pro”and “iPad” are completely different models. Apple has 3 different categories of iPads namely: iPad (iPad mini), iPad Air and iPad Pro wherein the iPad Pro is the most expensive and most powerful, it is at least 2-3x more expensive, and a lot better but it’s because it has more functionality and you can do a lot more things, especially business wise. Like it has Face ID while this iPad has Touch ID, the iPad Pro storage can go up to 1TB while this iPad is only up to 128GB.

But just because this iPad is a lot cheaper doesn’t mean it’s not as good. I’m actually impressed by its features, for its price, it’s a great deal. I went to the Apple store today to buy more iPad Pro and also checked this specific iPad, this iPad is a lot cheaper here on Amazon than in the store, but it’s all the same product and quality. The durability, functionality, battery life are all fantastic. My friend is happy, so I am happy."
B07BTS2KWK,239,2385,"THESE ARE BRAND NEW, not Refurbished!",jumptherope,5,-,25-Feb-19,-,0,"I received this iPad in Gold (Rose gold) for Valentine's day.
It's my first Apple product and it does live up to the hype.
I found a great case here for $10, and a stylus for $1.
As primarily KFire tablet user, I didn't think there would be much difference between the 10"" Fire and this iPad.
But there's *something* about using an iPad that just feels...different.
It's very thin, lightweight and I enjoy the user's interface. It's not
complicated, but rather it's clean and simple.
The screen is stunning and using a stylus (for the first time ever)
made every movement smoother.
There's a ton of available OPTIONAL security measures, which gives one a definite sense of security, but one can *opt out* of one, or all.
The ""gold"" choice is truly a ROSE GOLD. It's gorgeous and there are a few cases available in the same tone.
Now that APPLE has offered an iPad for a more reasonable price, it's worth a try to see what the fuss is about.
I don't see any limitations on this device, as a regular user of streaming video services, shopping, viewing news sites, etc.
This iPad doesn't ""wash the dishes"" for you----but it does almost everything else!"
B07BTS2KWK,239,2386,one of the few Apple products you can buy at near cost,Hil,5,-,10-Dec-18,2,0,"When this iPad is at Discount at $250, it's a steal. Most Apple products are overpriced. Some provide great values over competitors even at higher prices: Macbooks over Windows laptops is a big difference due to poor quality of Microsoft Windows. Some are knock-offs (iPhone vs top 4 Chinese brands: Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi). This iPad not only beats other tablets in terms of price but also software quality. Don't expect it to function like Pixel slate but at less than half the price, you get something just as solid. I currently own and manage this device and iPad air 2."

B07BTS2KWK,239,2388,"128 GB model for $329.99. Only downer, no access for a SD card, oh well.",Honest T.,5,-,13-Apr-19,-,1,First time buyer of a Apple product. I always bought android tablets. But this model was on sale from $429.99 to $329.99. So I bought it to see if it was good for me to use. I bought a cover that doubles as a stand and I bought a Bluetooth Keyboard. Both were about $15 each! I am learning my way around the system. I had to contact Apple support by chat. That took 2 minutes once I logged in. I asked for my systems specs. Because I wasn't sure I knew which one mine was. I may use this IPAD to use as a map when I drive. I am not sure if Apple has a map guide as good as WAZE. But I hope they do. The sounds of the twin stereo speakers are crisp and the volume is fair. I read here by some that these Apple tablets last 4 years max. Who knows if I should live that long. But if I do. I will save up about $700 and buy one of the faster models available to spoil myself. The A10 Fusion core CPU is zippy and well worth the $329.99!
B07BTS2KWK,239,2389,A great value for the money,Jason,5,-,26-Apr-19,2,0,"Fantastic tablet especially for the price. If you're looking for a tablet around the sub $300 price range this would be the one to get. You get a lot of what you pay for, a good processor for most tasks as long as their not intense video games or video editing, nice screen with good responsiveness (of course not as fast a refresh rate as the 120HZ on the iPad Pro but that's much more expensive), a good battery, and decent speakers. Overall a great tablet for the price that you should definitely check out and if you choose to do so, buy."

Refer to attached photo,WearyShopper,3,-,28-Mar-19,1,0,"Disclaimer: I do not own one, I've never seen one or had any chance to test one myself in real life, my review is based on the other reviews that are by default, free to read. It's faster than some yet slower than some others. It comes in more than one variation and multiple colors. It is considered expensive by some and worth the money by others. Battery life seams to be agreeable by more than my estimation of half the people whom submitted reviews (although I didn't read them all nor did I count the ones I did). I like the idea of one, but I dislike the idea of owning one. Thank you."

I’m happy with the things this does that my old one didn’t but mostly just thrilled to be able to do my normal daily internet activities without waiting for things to load. This iPad is thinner and lighter which is nice for when you drop it on your face when laying in bed! The WiFi only works good for me, but if you have spotty WiFi you might onewith cellular capability. As for the gold color, I love it. Sort of a cross between yellow and rose gold in color."
B07BTS2KWK,240,2392,Lawyers please read!,Frances B,3,-,20-Jan-19,-,1,"When is someone going to sue Apple for false advertisement??
Because of the design and lack of options in their software, the usable screen area is smaller than they lead you to believe.
If you swipe too close (about 1/4-1/2 inch) to any edge you activate a ""convenient"" task. There are no options to disable any of it.
This means the screen sizes are all misleading, false and incorrect.
Apple, if you're reading this, please just add toggles to disable this madness!"

Just use any wifi home or Starbucks, Mcdonalds etc. Its fast and has more things to do than the older ones. You can get hundreds of apps for free from App Store. To transfer from your old IPAD or phone just use Air Drop on both. NO Need to use Drop Box type apps. Air Drop transfers in seconds. You can print easily also."

Our family needed another tablet so we decided to give Apple a try. I have found the operating system experience to be very underwhelming. It's not as intuitive as android and our experience has shown it to be very buggy. I believe that ""Apple people"" stick with Apple because they simply don't try anything else.

I have an iPhone 7 Plus, so I was able to transfer everything through the cloud from my iPhone to my iPad. Other than switching some of the apps to the iPad compatible version and organizing my apps on the different pages, setup was a breeze.

I went back and forth with whether or not to get the 32gb or the 128gb. Thankfully, because I have the iPhone, I knew the apps I have on my phone were less than 32gb. With the iPad, 32gb is still more than enough for what I need. As a reference point, apps I regularly use include Netflix, Hulu, Pandora (with 572 songs downloaded), Kindle reading app, IMDB, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, retail apps (eg Amazon and QVC), and gaming apps like Wordscapes and Candy Crush. With that, I’m still only at 17gb. So glad I saved myself the $100.

I was always one of those people who figured I didn’t need a tablet because I have a good-sized smartphone. The difference, though, is remarkable. I also got a Bluetooth keyboard (there’s lots of great options varying in price through Amazon) to make for a makeshift laptop. I’m glad I did because it’s kind of hard to type on the iPad keyboard."

B07BTS2KWK,255,2549,Something Wrong...Had to Return,Jacq,2,-,03-Feb-19,2,0,"Everything worked fine at first. I signed into the iCloud account with my Apple ID on the pop-up keyboard, and stayed signed in. set to go.
Then I bought a Keys-To-Go external keyboard, which I loved because it was like using a laptop. Highly recommend, by the way...
Problem was, when I had signed out of my account. I tried to sign in again without the external keyboard and there was no way to get to the numbers on the pop-up keyboard anymore. Instead, there were two rectangles, one marked with a ""t"" and another with a ""5"".
Those were supposed to move down to access symbols and numbers. Only they didn't move. I only got a series of ""5's"" when trying to sign in the numbers of my Apple ID away from home.
Not good. Tried this again and again. Obviously a defect, and not noticeable at first, when I originally signed in when starting it up. The keyboard must have ""upgraded"" or something after it was set up, so that I could no longer use the numbers or symbols on the normal keyboard anymore.
I called the seller, stated that I had the insurance, and was told by him to ""take it in to the Apple Store"".
I then called Amazon and told them of the problem. The sent me a return label.
It has been sent back. Hopefully, the seller will go over it, find the problem, and I will get a timely refund."

B07BTS2KWK,261,2601,Surprise it’s an apple.,Lord Farquaad,3,Yes,12-Mar-19,1,1,"It’s definitely an IPad. I got a new one because mine was old and wouldn’t charge anymore with any charger except the original tattered one I got in the box, probably Apple up to their shenanigans of forcibly phasing out older products... oh well I chose to remain chained to their products. It’s an iPad and I was able to use my credits to pay for the majority of it so I can’t complain. This is much lighter than the gen two version I had, but somehow feels cheaper. It almost feels as though it’s not worth the price you pay. Battery life is great. Applications run well. I use it for my graduate classes and I can’t complain. My rating is based on the fact for the expense it doesn’t feel you’re getting the quality you should be getting... lowered memory, relatively same specs as the gen two. Sure the screens better... but to an extent I can’t see any better than I already do so what’s the point of such a clear screen."

Gets daily jobs done. iOS 12 is sort of annoying with multitasking when it’s better to use home button. Swiping To multitask is hard on safari or on landscape. Time in landscape is unneedingly places on left. Why not keep it on the center. What was gotten right on iOS 11 is totally gone on iOS 12. It’ll get some getting use to. So much for Apples idea of simplicity.

B01EUC7NPI,1,1,Read this before you read the negative reviews!! Turning 1-star reviews into 5-star!,Hal,5,Yes,13-Jun-17,"1,495",20,"I have three of these devices. I was happily sailing along without any problems and didn't understand the negative reviews ... until it happened to me.

Problem/Solution 1: First I had the unexpected power-off problem. It happened two or three times before I figured it out. I was holding the device along the right edge (where the power and volume buttons are). Holding it with one hand right along the right edge can cause the front case to squeeze together with the back case along the side where the buttons are located. Apparently this can activate the power button mechanism and shut the device off. Do not hold the device in such a way that you accidentally apply pressure along the right edge!

Problem/Solution 2: Today the device would not turn on. Nor would it display the charging screen (the big battery that fills up with green to indicate battery level while it is charging). So I held down the power button and the volume button simultaneously for about 20 to 30 seconds. (Another reviewer implies that it should be the ""volume down"" button. I did not pay attention to the position of my finger on the volume button.) The battery charging screen came up (because the charger was attached). Then pressing the power button caused the device to start up. All my apps and saved settings were still intact.

The display resolution is excellent. The battery life is phenomenal. The battery charges fast. Internal memory (2GB) is adequate to most needs. Not my needs, so I sometimes have to kill processes that Android automatically loads upon startup. Then I have enough memory. I emphasize that this is not typical for most users. (One of my favorite apps is a memory hog, but with good reason.) Internal storage is adequate (16GB). If you need more, you can add an additional memory card. I use an additional 128GB card. Anything else you'd like to know?"
B01EUC7NPI,1,2,"If you're a hobby artist and you are looking for something to draw on the go, then look no further.",GM,5,-,14-Jul-17,406,1,"If you're a hobby artist and you are looking for something to draw on the go, then look no further than this Galaxy Tab A with S Pen.
I have compared this tablet to Ipad Pro, Surface Pro and many other pressure sensitive tablets on the market, looking at price, hardware, display and definitely usefulness for drawing. If you're not looking for something to replace a PC or a laptop, this is definitely the best value for money spent.

The 3GBs of RAM and crisp, clean display makes watching videos and working with art programs a breeze. There is no lag when working on a large canvas. Since I bought this tablet I have been thoroughly enjoying my art, and I have tried almost all of the art programs in the play store.
By the way, for this device Samsung Apps has given FREE access to Art Rage! (usualy about $7). My favorite app though is MediaBang, it has the most features that I need. I have not missed using Photoshop on my PC, and I love the fact that I can draw directly on the screen as if I were drawing on paper.

This tablet is thin, light and ultra portable. I carry it with me everywhere in my purse. The S Pen is held safely and securely within the tablet. Some reviews state that the S Pen is a bit thin, but I have drawn comfortably with it for hours.
The battery life is wonderful, it has lasted me a week of drawing on it about 2-3 hours a day, though I do turn off the wifi when I am not actively using it which greatly helps with conserving battery power.

When I am not drawing I use my tablet for reading and browsing the internet. 3 months later, I am still quite pleased with my purchase and I 100% recommend it."
B01EUC7NPI,1,3,Excellent tablet for the price!,Rommel,5,Yes,10-Apr-18,153,3,"IMPORTANT: This review is for the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 SM-P580 Table WITH S PEN. In full disclosure, I also own the iPad Pro 12.9"" 2nd Generation version and I was unhappy with it. I've never been a fan of iOS, and I was turned off by some bugs in iOS 11.3 so I started looking for a good Android alternative at a good price. The Galaxy Tab A 10.1 with S Pen is a great value for anyone looking for an Android tablet with great specs at an attractive price point.
First of all, I chose the model with S Pen simply because it has 3GB of RAM, not for the pen itself. I don't care for it. I must say that I was impressed on how good the screen is, although I had to set it to a fixed brightness since the ambient sensor doesn't do a good job at managing brightness. I also had to add my own blue light filter app because Nougat on this device for some reason doesn't include a blue light filter. There is a night light button but it doesn't work well. The app I chose costs $1 for a 6-month subscription, so getting it was a no-brainer.
As far as storage, I added a 64GB microSD card I had lying around, so I'm good. I ordered myself a very affordable yet effective ProCase for my tablet, and to finish it all off, I added a Button Mapper app to deal with the annoying accidental brushes of the capacitive buttons that some reviewers find annoying. With that Button Mapper app, your tablet can be programmed to react only to double taps of the buttons, thereby doing away with accidental triggers.
You have to be patient with the screen response every now and then, the speakers are not the best, and it isn't the thinnest tablet either. But I would challenge anyone to find a better package with all these features, including AC wireless, for under $300. I will save you the work. As of today (2018.04.10) it is impossible. Believe me, I own a $1,000 iPad, and yet I am very much impressed by the capabilities of this handy little device. If you want the biggest bang for your buck and you're not married to the iOS ecosystem, the answer is simple. Buy it!"
B01EUC7NPI,1,4,GPS Navigation features are very good on the Galaxy Tab A!,Greg S.,5,-,20-Feb-17,533,8,"I've owned the Galaxy Tab A for about 2 weeks and so far I love it. It's perfect for reading e-books, internet browsing and all types and games. However, I've seen many conflicting and confusing comments regarding the GPS navigation capabilities. I was a bit concerned by all the confusion but I am here to tell you I was able to run GPS navigation in my car (WITHOUT WiFi). It worked great but I had to install the Google Maps APP first. The google maps App has a feature to download the maps. I simply downloaded the maps while I was at home on WiFi, then brought the Tab A into my car! The GPS navigation worked perfectly!!!
???Aug 2017 update???
Recently I have been using my Galaxy Tab 8 for navigation while I am flying. I now have installed the Avare app. it gives me moving map. Approach plates. IFR charts and airport info, with weather overlaid. Everything I need to navigate a private plane through all types of airspace in IMC/ instrument conditions. Still loving this tablet and the long battery life."
B01EUC7NPI,1,5,Beats carrying around a laptop & runs on Android!,GearHeadPeter,5,Yes,24-Nov-16,637,7,"I bought this to replace carrying around a laptop when we travel for fun. It weighs just over a pound and is easy to carry around. I love all the features like the built in micro-USB port, and the included micro-USB to USB 2.0 connector cable, and the high screen resolution. The fact that I can upgrade the storage space to an available 2TB is mind blowing. Having up to 13 hours of workable time is another great feature. I bought a 128GB SD card to see if that is enough space for now. My wife thought we might need to get a wireless keyboard, but once she saw how large the on-screen keyboard is said that is perfect."
B01EUC7NPI,1,6,"Great tablet, be sure to get an SD card.",Slo_matt,5,Yes,12-Dec-16,521,6,"Excellent tablet. The screen is huge, the battery life is amazing I use it a couple of hours a day and only need to charge about once per week so far, could go even longer.

I use the tablet for drawing, Kindle, email and a few games. It handles all of these without trouble. Games I've tried include Dragon's Lair, Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition, and Hearthstone, as well as Monkey Junior and other kid's educational games.

As a Kindle device, I love the larger screen. I have 20/20 vision, but as I've gone into my forties I find reading slightly larger print to be a better experience. The screen real-estate on this tablet means I can kick the text size up a notch and still have plenty to read on each page.

I also have a few large PDF documents, and with Adobe Reader (a free app) I was able to set them up to page through with a tap at the edge of the screen, just like a Kindle book. These documents are very image heavy, but the reading experience is still very smooth and fast. I was surprised by how nice it was. This tablet has some serious muscle.

One thing I was surprised by is how fast this thing downloads apps. Apps that will take a few minutes on my HTC M8 take less than one minute on this tablet. I assume this from better use of wireless AC, but the experience is great.

Since I do have the Android phone I mention above, all my apps from that phone auto-installed on the tablet as soon as I connected my Google account. That was very convenient.

One thing I would recommend is to pick up a 64GB SD card (or larger) for this tablet. Moving apps over to this card is very easy and fast, and if you store a lot of big files like movies or comic books or lots of pictures, then internal storage isn't going to cut it.

Another recommended accessory would be a decent set of bluetooth headphones.

If you're looking for a good 10.1"" tablet though, go ahead and stop looking, this is a great device.

Enjoy!"
B01EUC7NPI,1,7,Amazon charged me a $39.60 restocking fee!,CAK,1,Yes,18-Feb-17,235,5,"At first seemed like a great product but after a few days, the screen would go dark, and no combo of button pushes would bring it back on or to lock screen. It would act irradically, turning off and after a series of button pushes and holds, it would go to lock screen. When I would try to unlock with my pattern, it would go black. I would get a day or two of solid use, then all this would start happening again.

Samsung support has no long term solution and tells you to go through a 14 step process that ends in resetting to factory image. I wish there was a firmware or other fix because when it works, it's a great device!

I went through two of these with the exact same results.

I've read on the Costo site, 10's of similar reviews about this model, Galaxy Tab A 10.1 tablet. Not many on Amazon which is odd.

AMAZON Customer Relations: You need to reconsider restocking fees for faulty products. I have spent hours of my time screwing around with trying to make these two tablets work, plus the repackaging and shipping back to you. Very, very unfair to charge me. I tried to make it work. Extremely baffled and upset with you, for the first time I might add. I'm still without a tablet to use on top of all this!"
B01EUC7NPI,1,8,UPDATE: Do not buy,Colin Thompson,1,Yes,18-Aug-17,85,3,"I love this tablet. It has a 16:10 aspect ratio which is great for watching videos and browsing and all my other needs. The 4:3 aspect ratio on the S3 didn't work for me given the black bars when I watch videos

The S Pen is a bit small so you can get a 3rd party pen to use if need be but the S pen features are amazing. Really makes the tablet that much more useful. The level of customization you can do and taking notes and all the apps for it really turns the tab from a media consumption device to a productivity one as well.

The screen is nice and bright full HD 1920x1200 so everything is clear. I am upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 so I immediately noticed how much clearer everything is on the tablet

There are 2 cons however. 1. The tablet is designed to be held in portrait mode even though its most functional in landscape. So I find myself hitting the back button and menu button on accident. There's no way to turn off that functionality which leads to some annoyance

2. Not enough tablet optimized apps. Did developers give up on that? However the browsing experience is so good that I find myself using it over most apps that I would use on my phone.

Overall you have a well designed tablet in the $300 range. S Pen adds a lot of functionality that makes using it so much more efficient. I would say if you want an android tablet get this one.

UPDATE 8/31/18: After just ONE year the tablet stopped working. It doesn't turn on at all. I HAVEN'T dropped it, nor is there any other damage but it doesn't work. For that I changed my review to 1 star. I never had a tablet work for less than 3 years"
B01EUC7NPI,1,9,A HiddenGem,wayne a. sadowski,5,Yes,24-Mar-17,213,5,"I was hesitant to buy but not any more..Don't waste your money on an S3..or an IPad. got this for $241,37...what a bargain .the tablet is a hidden gem!... for the money is great! Bought it mainly for the S pen feature and it work flaw less, as good a my Surface 3 and Thinkpad Yoga it is responsive and the screen is very good and bright, took it outside in the sun and had no problem reading documents."
B01EUC7NPI,1,10,Not that Great,Kevin Fletcher,2,Yes,02-Sep-17,36,1,"Pros:
1. Amazing screen (super bright and nice colors)
2. Nice built quality
3. 16:9 aspect ratio (no black bars when watching full screen videos; Very small if there is)
4. Not much bloatware
5. Seriously Long Battery Life

Cons
1. Gets VERY SLOW after 4 months of my use (note that i don't install much apps, only use it for social media and Netflix)
2. The screen started to get connection issues after about 4 months of use (it will randomly turn off)
3. Display is not fully laminated to the glass
4. Two bottom firing speakers only (easily covered by hands when holding in landscape mode)
5. Bad camera
6. Battery takes forever to charge

B01EUC7NPI,2,11,I love this tablet,Shelia,5,Yes,06-Jul-16,294,2,"I love this tablet! This screen resolution is wonderful. Originally I had the 9.7 tab a and I was not satisfied with the screen resolution, so I sent it back when this tablet was announced. I do not regret my decision at all. If you are trying to decide between the 9.7 or the 10.1, I recommend you get the 10.1"
B01EUC7NPI,2,12,16GB of storage fills up quick.,L. Richardson,3,Yes,01-Jan-18,30,1,"Keep in mind the storage space. System comes with a bunch used already, and this will not allow you to install apps to an external SD card, so if you install a lot or large apps on it, it'll fill up quick. External SD slot appears only for extra personal files, not for extending the system's use."
B01EUC7NPI,2,13,Awesome tablet.,Terrence L. Williams,5,Yes,15-Feb-17,60,1,"I have been using Samsung Galaxy phones for quite some time, and the android OS for even longer. I needed a small device to basically stream the Optimum cable application into a room. I mounted the device to the wall with heavy duty Velcro and it works amazing. I can use the Optimum app, and others as I have the ability to control my smart home all from the device. Screen resolution is awesome and the speakers are solid as well. Good job Samsung!"
B01EUC7NPI,2,14,I am a seventy five year old on a fixed income who thought I would be getting a good deal for me for personal use and now I'm ...,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,25-Aug-17,93,5,"I received this tablet on June 11, 2017. Started having problems with tablet cutting off while surfing the net. It would just shut down. After a few days that stopped happening. Thought it was ok. Last night put table on charge and when I attempted to turn it on today, it is completely dead. Notice under my purchase orders states "" not eligible for returns after July 11,2017. I am a seventy five year old on a fixed income who thought I would be getting a good deal for me for personal use and now I'm out of $220.00 plus the price of keyboard and cover. I am heart broken."
B01EUC7NPI,2,15,unreliable - disappointed in Samsung & really upset with Samsung Customer Support,C. C. Robinson,2,Yes,03-Aug-17,34,1,"unreliable, quit after 2 weeks - Tab A (less than 2 weeks old) quit charging - I spoke with Samsung Tech support they walked me through getting it to charge again, but my use is in an art gallery where I have to leave it unattended so I need a reliable unit - I asked for a replacement but that is not covered under warranty & the best they can do is have me send it in for repair IF it breaks again - with no guarantee that it will be any more reliable when they send it back. Per on-line forums, this appears to be a common problem with many of their new tablets. I am VERY disappointed with Samsung - I have several other Samsung products and have always had good support with problems and I have been an advocate for the Samsung brand - this instance has now turned that around. I will probably return to Amazon if it quits again, but it a real hassle setting up a new unit - screen protector, case, software adds & deletes, etc.
Update - 4 hours later - I found that the storage was corrupt - after a reboot 6.43 GB of the 16 GB available was in use - per Samsung signature support there is a problem with the storage. I spent a little more than an hour on the phone with Customer Support (1st call disconnected after 15 minutes - finally got to a supervisor after a 15 minute wait and asking politely 3 different times) I have to send it on for repair. I am sending it back to Amazon. Dropping from 2 stars to 1
Update 8/12 - apparently the storage was probably not corrupt as indicated by Samsung signature service - Samsung devices are notorious for the amount of storage used by the system & bloatware - 10GB available out of the advertised 16GB is par for the course as I found with the emplacement tablet sent by Amazon (btw - their return process is excellent - had the replacement in 2 days & had a month to send old one back.)"
B01EUC7NPI,2,16,"Bad experience with Samsung customer service, will not purchase Samsung products ever again.",ccr,1,Yes,11-Jun-17,40,2,"Tablet turns off on its own. Called Samsung customer service four times, customer service making promises to return phone call, never happens. Will not replace after 4 months of purchase. Poor quality product and customer service. Will never buy Samsung product again."
B01EUC7NPI,2,17,"Fantastic for videos, live TV or internet / too heavy in the hand for e-book reading",Diamond M. Dominguez,5,Yes,08-Jan-18,16,1,"Works great! The 10.1 inch screen is superb for watching videos or live TV. It has 2 speakers at the bottom (most smaller tablets have only 1 speaker). It has a screen as big as you can get without having to buy a laptop. I already own an older model 8"" Samsung tablet since the year 2012. But when I recently subscribed to You Tube TV, I was told that the operating system in the old 8"" was not compatible. So I had to temporarily download You Tube TV in my phone, and transfer the video to my TV through chromecast. But I didnt want to continue using my phone for You Tube TV. So I bought the 10 inch tablet on sale.

I could have bought a new tablet with a smaller screen that was compatible with You Tube TV. However, what impressed me most about the tablet A 10 inch is that it has ""TWO SPEAKERS"" at the bottom, just like my old 8"" tablet. Do you know what a difference this makes when listening to videos or music? I can set this on my kitchen counter, turn up the volume up only halfway, and watch TV while I cook. My best friend has a 9.7 inch Samsung E-tablet with a single speaker at the bottom. He has to turn the volume all way up to the maximum get the same sound level as I get with my volume set only half way. I'm surprised that people don't pay more attention to the speakers when they shop for a tablet.

I carry my 10.1 tablet to the office and watch live TV (with headphones of course) while working at my desk. The screen resolution and colors are beautiful. The screen size is so large that you dont have to squint closely to look at it. For surfing the internet, the screen size is great as well. Also, the big screen is great when using Google Maps. Facebook lovers will love the big screen when looking at pictures and videos.

Cons: This is just my opinion...For reading books that I download, I'll continue to use my old 8"" Samsung tablet. I can hold it much better in my hands when I read. I find the tablet A 10.1 inch too big & bulky for book reading. Holding it in my hands for long periods is uncomfortable.
Con#2: Opening Apps. On the 10 inch tablet, I found myself frustrated at first when tapping an app to open it. I finally figured out that you have to tap the app lightly with the middle of your finger and the app will open (on my old 8 inch, I can tap an app any-kind-of way,and it will open). The 10.1 inch seems to be a little more fussy about the way you tap an app.

All 'n all, the Samsung 10.1 inch a very nice tablet. For me, the 10.1 inch will primarily serve as my video tablet for You Tube TV, Hulu, and Netflix. But for book reading, I'll continue to use my 8"" because it is easier to hold with one hand."
B01EUC7NPI,2,18,Beautiful tablet.,Emilie L. Romero,4,Yes,06-May-18,15,0,"The Galaxy tab A (white) is a beautiful tablet. I ordered an SD card, but while waiting for it to arrive I downloaded 10 plus apps and a whole season of the Great British Baking Show from Netflix and the 16 gig built in memory holds it all with a few gig to spare. The screen looks great, better than my Vizio HDTV. I like that I can use Google Play Store, it has everything I want. I have only played around with the s pen a little but it seems to write smoothly and responds well as a stylus. I am having trouble getting the screen to play on my tv, even though I bought a special micro USB to HDMI CABLE. Learning the android/ Samsung interface has been a slight learning curve. I find i accidentally hit the back button a lot when i am holping the tablet in landscape. Overall i am very pleased and i think as i figure it out it will keep getting better."
B01EUC7NPI,2,19,Great for a college student,Dee,5,Yes,28-Nov-17,16,0,"To be honest, I haven't ever really owned another tablet apart from a cheap Nextbook with Windows 10 that was on clearance due to being poorly made. So, that might make me slightly biased toward this one. I really like it a lot. I mainly use it for schoolwork and social media, and I use a Fintie keyboard case and a MEKO stylus with it (I don't have the S pen version). It's great with and without those accessories.

As of today, I haven't charged it in a week and it's at about 40%. Over the past week I've used it for about half an hour a day, because I haven't had any schoolwork to do it on it. When I do have schoolwork to do on it, I notice that it goes down about 10% per hour. When using something simple like Microsoft Word, it goes down slightly less per hour. When watching videos, it goes down more per hour. But generally, it has about a 10 hour battery life when being used constantly - this is much better than the other tablet I had.

When it comes to the software I need for school, I mainly use the Microsoft Office apps and INKredible. Microsoft Word works almost exactly like it does on a Windows computer, and OneNote is much better than it is on a Windows computer. INKredible is the best note-taking app that is available for this version. With these tools this tablet is absolutely great for writing essays and taking notes. The Google Chrome app can handle most of the websites and resources I need to use for my schoolwork.

The only cons I can think of are mainly that the internal storage is small, but you can always buy a micro SD. Also, I'm not quite great with the android software yet, but that's not really the tablet's fault. The tablet doesn't appear to be able to use Flash, which as I already said, does not allow me to use one resource I need for school."
B01EUC7NPI,2,20,SO disappointed!!!! 2 devices had to be returned!,C. L. Whipple,1,Yes,11-Mar-17,73,2,"Even before completing the set up, the tablet would shut itself down. Then afterward, it continued to randomly shut down. I requested a replacement and the new device did the same exact thing! This time I got a refund. Won't buy another Samsung tablet again! P.S. after encountering this problem, I read the reviews on this product and while there were good ones, it seems that all the negative ones were for this problem."
B01EUC7NPI,3,21,Device overheated and not charging.,Seung Man Kim,2,Yes,21-Aug-18,13,0,"I have been using this tablet about 4months. Today I noticed that the flashlight on the back of the tablet turned on even if I didn’t turned it on.
Also it was super hot around the flashlight. I almost got burn!!!!

I tried to restart the device. The screen turned off. But it didn’t restart until the flashlight turned off automatically after draining battery almost 50%.

It still drains battery and overheats device. And Tablet is not charging at all.

I am really disappointed it’s quality. :("
B01EUC7NPI,3,22,"Bought this in July 2017 and it worked great, although it's processor isn't fast enough",Dave Peters,1,Yes,19-Sep-17,70,0,"Bought this in July 2017 and it worked great, although it's processor isn't fast enough, now it just quit working. It won't power up so I called Samsung. The gal on the other end was nice but of course, doesn't speak English very well. After 40 minutes she conveyed that they must have the SN # which I can't find. She wanted me to take the back off but it's not obvious how to do that and I told her so but she insisted they MUST HAVE the SN#. Assuming I can get the back off, they want me to take it to a Samsung Repair shop some 40 minutes drive and the wait for the tablet will be 3 - 5 weeks. Then what, do this all over again, I mean this thing lasted barely 6 months!

Decent tablet but as usual FOREIGN TEC SUPPORT and the language barrier is terrible."
B01EUC7NPI,3,23,Screen Went Black After 10 Days.,Gustavo A,1,Yes,23-Feb-18,14,0,"Very disappointed with the Samsung Galaxy Tab A. I own 2 old Galaxy Tab 10.1 (had them for over 6 years) no problem with them, just wanted to upgrade. This one did not last but 10 days. Screen turned off, nothing I do will bring it back on. Tried everything, and called Amazon's Tech Support.
Long story short, sending it back today. Reading the reviews it seems that it is a very common problem with this tablet. Not sure if I'm getting a replacement or just wait until Samsung works out all the bugs."
B01EUC7NPI,3,24,Another great Samsung product - must buy,TechSavvyBuyer,5,Yes,23-Jan-18,12,0,"I bought this as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it. The screen size is adequate enough to do all kinds of internet browsing, emails, and of course media binge watching. Including YouTube, Netflix, and the lovely Amazon Prime. The battery life on average lasts over 3 days with moderate use, this includes being connected to wifi at all times, screen time on avg of about 4 hours per day, and no gaming whatsoever.

The resolution is nice and crisp, this definitely feels like a premium product. The speakers on board are very loud and clear. The touch is exceptionally responsive as with all Samsung products. It is definitely worth the price and provides excellent value."
B01EUC7NPI,3,25,Multiple deal-breaker issues,Majik,2,Yes,09-Aug-18,9,0,"The tablet I received had multiple issues:

1. When I touch the screen it makes a loud crackling noise indicating there's a short somewhere.

2. If Bluetooth and Wi-fi are both enabled they cause interference with each other. This results in low wifi speeds to the point of often being unusable and frequent connection drops for both wifi and bluetooth devices.

3. The charge port is flimsy. I would have returned it without the other two problems so I could get a refund before the connector broke.

4. Sometimes it crashes/reboots itself repeatedly when the charger is connected. I suspect this is related to the short that's causing the touch noise.

Also, as a general review of the device:

It is extremely basic. It is missing features you would expect in a tablet people use today such as:

* NFC
* Fast charging (the tablet takes about 5 hours to charge and doesn't support any method of rapid charging)
* Wireless charging
* Fingerprint reader

If you're just using it as a day to day second screen, it would suffice for that and do the job well given its age and price if it were fully functional."
B01EUC7NPI,3,26,Died for no reason at 11 months,Greysean,1,Yes,02-Sep-18,11,2,"This is the second one I have bought for my son. The first one lasted 6 years, this one just died for no reason. He was using it and closed it - went back to turn it on and nothing. Completely dead. Tried charging, tried turning it on- total black screen. Will call on Tuesday(tomorrow Labor Day) will update when I find out if Samsung stands by their warranty. Really hope so, very upset by this."
B01EUC7NPI,3,27,Buyer Beware!,weekend,1,Yes,22-Nov-18,7,0,"Purchased a few days ago. Setup was easy but had issues with opening emails! The 10.1 was to replace the Samsung Galaxy SM-T320 tablet which was having battery charging issues. Purchased a new battery which was defective! Read multiple positive reviews on the 10.1 so decided to buy. After setup, I noticed I had to tap the screen 3 or 4 times on occasion for it to perform. It would not open my emails at times although my T-320 opened them with low battery! I ran a speed check on my WiFi and was getting 140 mbps on the download and 11.6 on the upload using the 5G network. Capable speeds but I called my cable provider to set up a service call just to make sure everything was working properly. Tech said all was performing up to specs so he tried canceling my email acct and reactivating it. Tablet still did not open emails intermittantly and became very frustrating so I'm sending it back. Very disappointing and beginning to wonder about Samsung products having issues with several phones, the T-320 tablet, and now this!!! Buyer beware!"
B01EUC7NPI,3,28,Bad memory management,Carl W. Taitano,1,Yes,21-Nov-18,9,0,This tablet is terrible with internal memory. 1st it keeps adding unwanted apps the keeps eating up internal memory. I bought a memory card to move the major apps to the external memory card. It still puts copies of games to the internal memory. After only one year of usage i keep getting notices of insufficent memory. Sooner or later the tablet wiil just be useless. Wasted $
B01EUC7NPI,3,29,the fire 10 felt a lot lighter when holding but the deal breaker was the tab a had a fairly better screen than any other tablet I've seen,RBT Fishing,5,Yes,12-Jun-17,20,0,"I wanted a tablet that is compatible with the amazon movie app, the Netflix app and has around 10 inches. I tested a number of tablets but it really came down to between this and the fire 10 hd. both opened tabs and apps at the exact same speed, the fire 10 felt a lot lighter when holding but the deal breaker was the tab a had a fairly better screen than any other tablet I've seen, It is less pix-elated despite claiming the same resolution, the sound is a bit better but the brightness goes much brighter. Overall The tablet has been doing everything I wanted it too so far but I will need to do a second review 3-5 months down the line for my final thoughts.
Also, if you are looking for a dirt cheap tablet that will run the Netflix app I recommend the nexus 10"
B01EUC7NPI,3,30,Okay if it lasts,Tai,2,Yes,19-Aug-18,10,1,I liked the tablet a lot in the begining. I've had it since Jan 2018. But abount 2 months in it just shut iff and wouldnt turn back on. I got it to turn back on once about a month later before it did it again. Hasnt turned back on since and everywhere wants to charge me the price I paid for it to fix it so I just haven't bothered. Given up on it since. Not a bad tablet when it's working though.
B01EUC7NPI,4,31,and they love it. Good ease of use,Frank B,5,Yes,14-Jan-18,8,0,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my parents, and they love it. Good ease of use, and great performance. There is a built-in maintenance tool that allows the user to quickly optimize the device with ease (perfect for my Mom).

We own many Samsung products already, so we expected nothing less as far as quality goes.

The only con that I noticed (annoying but very minor flaw) is that whenever we assign a picture as the home screen, it's zoomed in way too much and cuts off the photo. We tried scaling/reducing the pixels of the original photo, taking a new photo with the tablet, etc., only to have the same results. This never happened with the older Samsung 10 inch tablet from 2012. The Samsung tech support could not assist either. We ended up using a third party app to properly set the home screen photo."
B01EUC7NPI,4,32,Great tablet with perma-bloatware.,Trogdor,4,Yes,30-Jan-17,13,2,"Great battery life. The S-pen is great and I can even use it with very few complaints with Microsoft OneNote (Which is why I got this thing). My biggest complaint is the bloatware. You can't get rid of Flipboard. You can fortunately eliminate it from being accessible from swiping home screens, but you still get obnoxious notifications from it and you can't un-install. So in short, great tablet. Unhappy with the bloatware."
B01EUC7NPI,4,33,It's a wonderful tablet.,Vargr,4,Yes,26-Jul-17,8,0,"I had my original 10.1 note from launch to when it got stolen about 2 years later, and a replacement from them to when I purchased this.

I have moved away from samsung phones, not because of the Note 7 fiasco, but because of their decisions as a company regarding the OS and some of the stunts they've pulled with hardware and pricing. That said, their tablets are still the best on the market if you're looking for stylus enabled android devices. While I'm a professional first, and an artist as a hobby, I do still draw, nightly if I can, for at least a few hours, and the purchase of my original note was to replace pen and paper for college at the time, and possibly serve as a bridge between my artbook and the realm of digital paint.

It served me wonderfully in both areas, and endeared me to the note brand.

This Tab A with S Pen is the quintessential successor to the 2014 and 12"" note updates to the original release.

It has a great screen, absolutely beautiful, the specs are wonderful, it's formfactor is aesthetically pleasing, people around the clinic often ask me what tablet I have, and I have found it still covers notes in clinicals and meetings or patient studies very, very well. To par with its predecessors, which was perfect (you'll need lecture notes to really experience the functionality). However, on the overall software front and artistic standpoints, I find it sub par to forefathers. Sketchbook runs in a very choppy and sloppy state on this tablet, artrage feels less than smooth, and some of my other apps work better on my older note tablet as well. So, I'm taking one star where I should take 2, but in the end, I don't think many people are buying this tablet for the same reasons I did, and when you factor in the beautiful battery life increase it's really, genuinely, just a solid tablet for the price.

My verdict is that if you're an artist, you're probably better served getting the 12"" note, or the 2014 edition. However, if you're getting this for business and personal use of the more standard affair, then you can't go wrong here."
B01EUC7NPI,4,34,"Pen, Note taking, 3D design workflow",Corey U,5,Yes,21-Nov-16,169,1,"Update: I made a snap on 3D printable pen holder to make the stylus more comfortable during long use. Its available at thingiverse [...]

Bought as a paper notebook replacement. I tried using it with evernote but quickly switched to onenote because it has less delay when writing with the pen and has better pen features overall. I have been taking notes like crazy now and the pen is what really opens up the usefulness of a tablet for me. Very pleased so far.
I also do design work and have found that taking a picture of a part im working on, sketching on the picture and then importing it into my CAD software for design has been an amazing unforeseen feature. Apps like Autodesk Sketchbook are great for this but quick sketches can be done right in one note and then synced to my desktop.
The amazon kindle app does not support the split screen feature but I found that making the font size huge on my phone and flipping through pages quite quickly with my left hand while taking notes on the tablet with my right is actually a pretty good way of doing things and only takes a few extra seconds to set up. I can be in a restaurant and studying in half a minute while I wait for my order.

Also does other tablety things that other tablets do."
B01EUC7NPI,4,35,I like everything about my Samsung Galaxy TAb A,Bryant S.,5,Yes,03-Feb-17,43,1,"I like everything about my Samsung Galaxy TAb A. it is great for work, movies, music, ETC...... It like having your own portable laptop."
B01EUC7NPI,4,36,Two separate tablets both with random rebooting issues. Common problem for an otherwise nice tablet.,Crutnacker,1,Yes,16-Jan-17,63,1,"Samsung has a loyal fanbase which always makes me think I'm simply unlucky. Now I'm not so sure.

I am now on my third Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1. My first gave me issues from the start. It took forever for me to get it booted, and once I did, the tablet would completely cut out at random intervals and need to be completely restarted. I tried every fix I could find on the internet, and nothing kept it running for more than 30 minutes at a time.

The second tablet from Amazon (I purchased from Amazon, not a reseller) came to me with the box unsealed and the tablet sitting in its box with the protective wrapper off of it and sitting on top of it. I didn't even try this one, but I wondered I wondered if maybe I'd been sent a return by mistake.

The third tablet worked great...... for a few days. But I'd notice when I'd pick the tablet up, sometimes it would be in the initial boot phase where you have to enter a pin and wait for your apps to load in, rather than the lock screen. It never happened when I was using it, though. Then last night as I was asleep, I awoke to a steady sound that sounded like a dripping sound. Disoriented I was trying to find the source of the sound and realized it was the tablet, at the lock screen of the boot mode, lit up brightly, and making a clicking sound.

I will say that I loved the tablet while it was working. It seemed like a good value for a big screen tablet with a near retina display, and other than an odd placement of speaks. If you look at the reviews of this tablet, you'll see that for many of the one star reviews, people had trouble with random shutdowns and crashes while they were using it. After two bum tablets, I simply don't want to roll the dice that I'm going to get one that's going to last a few years. I was hoping I'd found an alternative to buying a more expensive iPad, but it looks like I'm going to have to go the Apple route if I want something reliable."
B01EUC7NPI,4,37,Really Nice iPad Alternative,Karo56,5,Yes,02-Oct-17,6,0,"My Wish List said, ""iPad Pro w SPen. I'm SO GLAD that this is what I got instead! While waiting on it, I did lots of Research, I'd never heard of this Tablet. I used Youtube, since the Samsung site is very poor compared to Apple's with regards to what one can do with it. I have an iPad, but it's getting glitchy, so I was looking to upgrade, and I think I have. My only issue is that even when using Chrome, as I do on my PC, to log into my iCloud acct. and use Pages, I cannot use Pages on this Tablet. I'm not a techie, I just want things to work, and this is how I did it on my Laptop. Anyway, this is a really nice alternative to the iPad, love Split Screen, the SPen applications, and as an Artist, the ability to use really good Artist Apps is fantastic. The S Pen is nice, no lag, the screen responds where the pen touches, etc. The pen is also a good tool to use instead of a greasy finger for scrolling, etc."
B01EUC7NPI,4,38,Nice Tablet,J. Dur,5,Yes,20-Jul-17,10,0,This tablet is a very good deal and works well. only thing I could say bad is it only has 16GB of storage but that's probably why such a good deal but u can always add a Mini SD in these to add more. I put a 32GB one in it.
B01EUC7NPI,4,39,A Pain Compared to My Apple Devices...,believeinthestars,3,Yes,08-Sep-18,4,1,"Wow, have I learned a lot about how superior Apple operating systems and software are compared to Android!
Beautiful display, decent sound quality and nice keyboard and navigation functionality... But what should have been done automatically and seamlessly upon startup, as with all my Apple devices, was frustrating and often completely impossible, despite hours of time texting with Samsung support. Simple things like adding an email account, but not being able to access its contacts, no autocorrect, no texting without searching to find messaging apps that have frustrating limitations...sleep mode that won’t respond to touch, etc., primitive and for me unacceptable - now I know I’ve been spoiled by the superiority of iPad ‘s effortless design and user-friendliness. I’m sending this back and will happily spend a little more for a new iPad..."
B01EUC7NPI,4,40,A delightful productivity-boosting & creativity-boosting product with a magical pen!,AE,5,Yes,27-Nov-17,6,0,"What a fabulous and delightful product! I bought the 10.1"" Samsung tablet primarily as a large format but lightweight e-reader for reading technical books (e.g. coding books in Kindle format) or financial reports (usually in PDF format) while travelling to & from the city.

As a large e-reader, the device is faultless. Indeed, it's so light weight, and the screen so bright and clear, that now I often do my technical reading outdoors by the beach instead of in my office!

The S pen is a sheer joy to use, as it glides so smoothly, with so little friction, it's like - er - writing on glass.:) If you are a techie, a student or a business person, the S pen is brilliant for taking notes, sketching ideas, drawing charts and diagrams, etc. You can write, draw, erase, try again, save, share .... all with a few light taps with the magical pen. It provides an enormous boost to productivity and creativity.

Also, the art applications available with the S pen are such a delight that you might - like me - switch to being an artist in your spare time!

A week after buying this lovely device I don't know how I ever lived without it!"
B01EUC7NPI,5,41,"Fantastic Tablet, Great for college!",Isabella,5,Yes,01-Jun-18,6,2,"I got this as a gift from my grandma to replace my several years old galaxy tablet, and I absolutely love it. Ive been using it for everything from reading comic and watching netflix, to taking notes and drawing.
Using this tablet for school has meant not needing to take hardly anything with me to clas because now everything is in my tablet! I take notes in the samsung notes app, I can annotate professor provided pdfs with the write on pdfs app, and can easily use the microsoft office suite through their apps.
An amazing product! havent had any issues, pen is accurate, battery life is good, screen is great. 10/10 would recommend!"
B01EUC7NPI,5,42,"Screen has twice stopped working, very frustrating",Kid Kyoto,3,Yes,03-Oct-16,44,0,"EDIT 4: As mentioned, the screen has twice shut down, completely failing to respond. I could not get it repaired overseas but during a trip back to the US I sent it in to Samsung (took about 2 weeks to mail it in and get it back) and was happy with the service. We'll see how long the repairs last, especially since I'm coming up to the end of the warranty. It's especially frustrating since I have an older tablet (from 2011) and other than changing the battery after 5 years never had a problem.

So my bottom line is it's a great product, fast, easy to use, good looking, when it works. I would recommend considering an extended service plan and do NOT get this if you live outside the United States.

EDIT 3: AND after 3 or 4 weeks the screen is dead again.

EDIT 2: OK I don't know how to react to this. After two months of waiting for parts I reclaimed this from the service center, figuring I would try and get it fixed on my trip to the United States. I plugged it in and... it worked. Perfectly. So maybe all I had to do was let the battery drain and restart? None of the various customer service techs ever suggested that. I'll use it for a few more weeks and then see how it goes.

EDIT: I have to significantly downgrade my initial review, this WAS a fine tablet for about six months, and then the screen stopped working. I hadn't dropped, bumped or otherwise damaged the device, it just stopped working. No amount of rebooting, recharging or other measures had any effect, even Samsung's online help wasn't able to do anything. Worse yet since I'm working overseas it was not covered by the warranty and after 6 weeks the service center is still waiting for parts. I'll revisit this if/when it's repaired but at this stage I think I'd be better off buying any of the $100 Android tablets I see.

ORIGINAL: I got this to replace my 5 year old Toshiba and really like it. It's light, it keeps a battery charge for ages, has a good wifi antenna and runs all my favorite apps.

Set up was a breeze, once I signed into my Android account my apps were installed and synced up.

Storage is a bit low but I got a 32 gig memory card and that can hold my photos, PDFs etc.

My only complaint is the unnecessary software Samsung puts on, a newsfeed I don't want or need, a dozen apps I'll never use. Most of them can be removed but it's pretty annoying."
B01EUC7NPI,5,43,Just like a Samsung Note phone w/S pen but bettet!,S. Crosby,4,Yes,25-Jun-18,4,0,"Nice. So far so good. Easy set up. Love the new location/orientation of the home buttons. They are on the short bottom end. I use my tablet to read books and write papers. The buttons on my older Samsung Tab A were located on the long end of the tablet. Every time I went to move my hands or anything I would accidentally hit the home button which was frustrating. However, with this tablet I can hold it and not have to worry about accidentally hitting the button!
This is portable and easy to use. I wanted something that I could use Microsoft Office on (and not get frustrated with), Kindle books, editing papers and photos etc. This fits the bill. I paired it with a Fintie Keyboard Case with Detachable Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard. Awesome!!! It does have a significant amount of bloatware that's really not needed and is a pain."
B01EUC7NPI,5,44,Good so far.,Roy,4,Yes,10-Mar-17,75,1,"Good so far.

Performs great! It's mainly used for taking notes and homework. Unfortunately Samsung Notes was a let down, So i use OneNote which works just fine.

Autodesk sketchbook was the only drawing app i've installed, i haven't tried anything else. the performance is OK. There is some delay if you are working with a huge brush size, which is typical.

OneNote comes preinstalled when i first got the tablet. There are also a few other bloatware that I had to disable because it takes up internal memory space... kind of annoying but easily disabled by going to settings.

the 16GB internal memory space is really small. Samsung has disabled turning external SD cards to internal storage.. which is rather unfortunate. And really annoying moving files between internal and external card! But understandable to prevent card failure. Definitely get an external SD card to store pics/downloads/ etc. I am not sure if apps can be moved on the external SD card, since i cannot find the option to do so.

PDF files loads quickly. No hassle.

Write on PDF is something i use to write on PDF files, but the files has to be in the internal memory to be edited. It works as expected, not much to say about it.

Browsing the web is ok. sometimes it lags and hesitates to load up a page for a second, but it's not a big deal since it's not that slow.

The S-pen is nice and is very light and thin. If you don't mind drawing on a very thin and short stylus then it shouldn't be much of a problem. But for a lot of people, writing with a small thin pen is a pain. I bought Bamboo Smart and it's basically the same thing as the S-pen, but more comfortable to use when writing for a long period of time. I suggest buying something similar if you are going to use the S-pen a lot.

I was actually hesitant going for this tablet because of the reviews stating that the tablet's screen goes black and never turns back on. There's also force reboots that i was worried about, but it seems like i didn't get a defect.. So far. I'll update if something goes wrong.

Overall, it's great if you are looking for a tablet that has a pen for a good price. It's not heavy, and it's portable.

Edit 9/3/2017:
it seems like the screen has some problems. whenever i try to make a straight line at a particular part of the screen (the left part of the screen) it ""curves"". it is a hardware issue, not software.too late to return for a new one since i've had it for quite a while."
B01EUC7NPI,5,45,Perfect for Casual Use (Hint! Gift for your parents!),Brian Duckworth,4,Yes,04-Jan-19,2,1,"This a great, low budget tablet. It is not top of the line, it is not overly powerful, and it is not a high-end pro-use device. However! It is exactly the perfect device for casual day-to-day use. I got one for my mother in November, and another one at Xmas for my step-father, once the tablet envy set in from seeing my mother's.

Picture quality is phenomenal, very crisp and detailed. Material quality is not bad at all. It won't survive a terrible beating, but it's also not going to break from the inevitable bumps and drops incurred by daily home use. Sound quality is what you would expect - better than a cellphone, not as good as anything with ""real"" (i.e. larger than a dime) speakers.

One of the nicest things about this tablet is the expandable storage. Run out of space? You can pop any storage size card in there and you're good to go. Battery life thus far seems to be pretty great: about 8-10 hrs of medium-heavy use, and much longer if it sits idle.

Now, what do my parents use their tablets for? Netflix, Facebook, their ridiculous micro-transaction games, news articles, occasionally YouTube/Spotify, etc.
Meaning - nothing too RAM or storage heavy. This tablet will cover that kind of use no problem, and it looks good doing it.
If you need something for professional/technical use, you may want to invest a bit higher than this. But if you just want something for casual, daily use - this is one of the better tablets on the market."
B01EUC7NPI,5,46,Could be better,Erin E.,3,Yes,14-Aug-17,6,0,"I bought this to replace my Samsung Note 10.1 Tablet that I have had for years and finally died. I tend to just use the tablet for games, email, internet searches, etc. I find this tablet to be more boxy than my old one, the camera isn't flush with the back of the tablet making it feel clunky and not sleek. I also don't like the control buttons are on the actual frame vs on the screen. I find that when holding it landscape that it is easy to hit the back/multi application buttons and it takes me out of what I am working on or playing. The charging cord is shorter than others which is kind of frustrating.
Overall its a good tablet for what I use it for, but the casing design is disappointing compared to an older tablet model that was very light and streamlined."
B01EUC7NPI,5,47,Warning...It just stops turning on.,Wendi L.,1,Yes,26-Jan-18,8,0,"The tablet itself is great, however after 3 weeks of use it stopped turning on. Apparently based on other reviews this is a common issue. I used Samsung chat for assistance and they told me to hold the power button and volume down button at the same time for 60 seconds and it should come back on. I tried that several times and it didn't work. Fortunately the company sent me a return label and now I am waiting on that refund. I want to get another one but am very skeptical at buying this one again."
B01EUC7NPI,5,48,Much improved over earlier model,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,28-Mar-18,6,0,"I bought this tablet to replace an older Samsung Tab 4 model that was developing various issues. I'm pleasantly surprised at how much better the Tab A is. It's faster, the WiFi works better, and the battery life is very much improved. I'm very happy with it."
B01EUC7NPI,5,49,No warrantee! Catastrophic failure and loss of all data 4 months.,Spencer Walker,1,Yes,25-Apr-18,8,0,"The tablet was great in every way. Then, 4months in, it suddenly turned off and will show no signs of life. No reset pattern will work. Plug it in, nothing. It's sudden death. Took data with it. Seller won't resond.

Tablet repair place said they see this a lot."
B01EUC7NPI,5,50,... after a month of steady use it still works great even after the auto update to Android Nougat 7,H.T,2,Yes,15-Jul-17,5,0,"Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T580NZKAXAR 10.1-Inch 16 GB, Tablet (Black)
I am downgrading my initial 5 star review after a year of frustration with the location of the tablets capacitive touch controls (Home, Back, Overview) on the tablets right edge in Panorama mode which you will be using 99% of the time. It would have been more sensible to locate these touch controls next to the microSD slot. The buttons extreme sensitivity to any contact and lack of an internal feature that actually works to limit its' response or disable it completely, does not work. I have used several apps that claim to address this problem but to no avail, the only solution would be to root the device.
Its' still a great tablet but this one glaring engineering issue punches it down fron 5 to 2 stars."
B01EUC7NPI,6,51,DO NOT BUY!,Susannadanna,1,Yes,22-May-18,6,0,Would give 0 stars if I could. Lasted about 2 months and then screen went black. Too late for Amazon to take it back and Samsung said that Amazon is not a licensed dealer of their product so they wouldn't do anything. Said it could even be a foreign knock off. Total waste of money!
B01EUC7NPI,6,52,No storage capacity,BassTrombone1979,1,Yes,10-Feb-19,2,0,"I love the use of a stylus. I have a Wacom at my desk at work. It drives I.T. nuts because they do not understand how to use it well. I have a samsung Note 8 phone (and the 7, 6, 4, and 2 before that). That gives you an idea of my expectations when getting this.

The physical aspects of this are average, the picture is not bad, the sound is not bad. I have a 50 GB SD card installed and have transfered all programs to it that I can. According to this I still have 15/16 GB used. I am constantly getting low memory warnings telling me to clear up space.

I have 0 MB of pictures, documents, videos, or audio installed. It sees a little under 6 GB of apps installed. And I don't wantoto or can't uninstall the others. So this device is somehow using 10GB or so for internal processes.

It is advertised as having 16 GB of internal storage but fails to mention that more than 50% of it is unusable and detrimental to the performance of this device."
B01EUC7NPI,6,53,So what if it's only WIFI,Doc Grit,5,Yes,16-Nov-18,2,0,"I've had this tablet since April of 2017 and I have not regretted it. To make a long story short my Kindle HDX 8.9 (approaching 5 years old) died a slow battery death even after installing a after market battery. I wanted another tablet to use during my frequent visits to medical buildings for stays of a number of days. Trust me, if I had known now about the other brand of tablet I did buy, I would have bought another one of these. In my opinion, the way the that the other brand of tablet has it's system written is totally bad (it's not a Kindle, but if Amazon had another tablet like the old HDX , I would have bought the Kindle) What brand did I buy and hate...well, you know Amazon will not let me say, but it has an ""O"" for the last letter of it's name. I will let my son take the newly purchased one to work and try to sell it at a 40 percent loss...and get me another Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1....."
B01EUC7NPI,6,54,Met my expectations.,E. Sanchez,4,Yes,24-Oct-17,5,0,"This tablet works great for the purposes that I bought it for. I bought it together with a keyboard case and use it for school work, taking notes, online quizzes, assigned reading, etc. It performs well for all of that, I can type in Word (you can use the Microsoft Office apps for free if you have a Microsoft account which is a big plus), read a PDF, and listen to a recorded lecture at the same time with no problem. Being only a ten-inch tablet I did expect screen space to be limited but even with the multi-window feauture I got used to it fairly quickly and became comfortable with it. Battery life seems about average, but I can usually use it for about a week on a full charge (though that isn't really on heavy use). I give it four stars because the materials do feel a little cheap in some spots but if you're going to be keeping it in a case this shouldn't be an issue. Also, the sound (even with headphones) seems a little quieter than other devices. Overall this tablet is great for a casual, light workload. It's also really portable on top of that, I was considering getting a Surface Pro before this but this was way cheaper and did what I needed it to do."
B01EUC7NPI,6,55,Samsung will not let you control/customize this device,Grumpy Monkey,2,Yes,31-Jan-19,2,0,"Like most android users, I choose android for the ability to customize the experience to my liking. While my note5 was an adequate presentation of that idea, this tablet is not: it is the worst android offering I have seen from any manufacturer. Most of the settings are fixed by samsung and cannot be changed by the user, such as:
- Cannot remove pre-installed apps (do not give excuses samsung, it's my device not yours)
- Cannot disable most notifications, and many continue to re-appear after dismissal
- Cannot change the theme at all, no option for the superior dark theme which saves eye strain and battery life
- Cannot disable or remove integrated services I don't want like 'find my device' or 'knox' (again, no excuses please - this is my device)
- Auto-brightness adjustment is extremely poor compared to samsung phones - the screen practically turns off when not in direct light, and the level of adjustment is not configurable
- Stock android bluetooth support is supplanted by samsung's crappy 'smart things' app (so you cannot transfer files for example without using this junk)
- Setup menus force you to agree to 'optional' stuff and then go turn it off later

Unfortunately it seems that samsung is moving further down the road of taking choices away from the user. The ability to make those choices was why I choose samsung - next time I will choose another manufacturer which respects the fact that I am purchasing, not licensing, the device. There is simply no excuse for this kind of controlling behavior in a personal computer's software. If you want to gain full control over this device (which is what you would expect from any other kind of computer), you have to risk bricking it to gain root access.

The only good thing to say about this tablet is that the hardware meets samsung's usual high standards in that department."
B01EUC7NPI,6,56,"Looks good on paper. In real life, not so much.",TechByter,2,Yes,18-Oct-18,3,0,"Only about 5GB of the 16GB of memory is available. The operating system and Samsung junk take up 3/4 of the space, so I was unable to migrate important applications from another device. It is possible to move some of the applications to an SD card, but many of the larger applications must run in main memory and all of the Samsung junk cannot be uninstalled or moved. It's considerably heavier than an iPad. The build quality seems good and I have other Samsung devices, so I really wanted to like this. After trying for a week to like it, though, I could not."
B01EUC7NPI,6,57,Very large tablet,ajp,2,Yes,29-Mar-17,7,1,"Update ,
8 months and the tablet freezes and does not respond to touch .
Costs too much to repair .
I should've just invested in an iPad as the SD card is pointless in this .

Huge , I love this as an alternative to carrying my laptop.
I was disappointed to find that I'm unable to use my Office 365 app on this tablet , but with expansion of memory it appealed to me over an iPad.
It is a bit heavy ,but I can adjust ."
B01EUC7NPI,6,58,And the AMOLED display is very nice. I might even see if I can use ...,Kevin,5,Yes,30-Nov-17,4,0,I returned the Amazon Fire HD 10 and got this Samsung tablet because it's much more versatile and compatible. I got the Tab A for $229 and a couple of days later it's now $327. Although technically this model is more than a year old from the release date in 2016 its quite impressive and especially for the price. I've not used the pen much and I can tell that the rubber tip drags on the screen too much for extended writing which is probably why the tip is replaceable. When Wi-Fi isn't available I just tether it via Bluetooth with my Samsung S8+ and voilà. And the AMOLED display is very nice. I might even see if I can use wireless mouse with it. And the Smart View is very convenient to display on my Sony TV.
B01EUC7NPI,6,59,Meh. Note 10.1 is better,Ingaffa,2,Yes,11-Nov-18,3,0,"I'm kinda disappointed, actually. Thought I was buying an updated Note 10.1, but that's on me for not paying closer attention, I guess. This is too light. I feel like it's going to break much too easily. It doesn't have s-note, it's got ""Samsung notes"" or something instead, that sounds like s-note, but is a much inferior program. They say s-note isn't compatible, but I was able to side-load it OK. I shouldn't have to side-load it. I hate, HATE, that its default orientation is vertical instead of horizontal. The only positive about it compared to the Note 10.1 is that the charging port is on the top instead of the bottom."
B01EUC7NPI,6,60,Nice large tablet but heavy,CeruleanBlue,4,Yes,15-Jan-18,6,0,"If you don't mind a heavy tablet, this seems to be a solid, large tablet. Bought it for another who wanted a larger screen. If you can afford the extra $ spent, the galaxy # S2 9.6 inch would us a better device and lighter."
B01EUC7NPI,7,61,Touch screen not responsive,RickB,1,Yes,09-Feb-17,66,3,"Very dissatisfied. Bought this for my wife, Touch does not respond more than 30% of the time. We found only good reviews when we shopped on Amazon. After it arrived and we had issues with the touch screen we called Samsung tech support. They said there was no way to calibrate or fix the issue. Then we found lots of bad reviews on the internet from other Samsung tablet owners. We tried all sorts of ways to touch the screen while on internet sites. Sometimes it would respond and most of the time it did not."
B01EUC7NPI,7,62,Awesome Tablet.,CHRIS ECKERSEN,5,Yes,25-Sep-17,4,0,"I use this everyday for my school work. It's replaced my laptop, in terms of just about everything. The high point of this device is the massive battery and power management. I charge it once a week. There really isn't anything it cant handle. It is a bit weighty, which is to be expected from such a large battery. The back plate is magnetic,so I can hang it on my fridge, given the price, I try not to do it too often. The screen is quite responsive and extremely bright at max. Most of the time I have it set to auto-brightness. This is a great alternative to the ultra-expensive Ipad, honestly you get a much better value.It also has a micro sd card slot for expanded storage. I bought a 64gb micro sd card with this tablet as well.
A few suggestions when buying this, get a nice case and a tempered glass screen protector, especially if you plan on using an S-pen."
B01EUC7NPI,7,63,"Fantastic tablet, definitely recommended",Dr. Claw,5,Yes,13-Nov-17,5,0,"Fantastic Tablet (Leisure, games, videos)

Ive had it for a few days now and I have to say, for a budget tablet, this thing is a beast. I LOVE IT. Fast, Bright, and very capable for numerous projects.

Pros: Big, bright screen. Excellent touch screen sensitivity. Multi-window is rad. High quality for a budget tablet. I like making pretend I have a giant phone.

Cons: Speakers on the bottom (When tablet is sideways for video watching, it feels like you have one earbud in), Not much else"
B01EUC7NPI,7,64,Great Tablet with active stylus for great price,Nabeel,5,Yes,17-Jul-17,4,0,"This is the first tablet that I have bought and I bought Tab A 10.1 with S Pen primarily for note taking. I have to say that I am really enjoying the product. The battery life looks amazing although I have just used it for 1 day, so lets see how the battery holds over time. The S Pen works flawlessly. The precision of the pen and palm rejection are amazing. I use S Pen alot with the Inkredible app and I love the way the pen moves on the screen. It should be noted that I am using a Glass screen protector and yet I don't get any friction which could ruin the note taking. I did update to Android Nougat almost immediately. Overall the Nougat update works fine. There are a few kinks here and there sometimes in the update, but they are minor and do not impact the usage in anyways. The camera is fine, not too great, but that can be expected from a sub $300 tablet which already has a full HD display aswell as Wacom sensors in the screen to detect stylus with 2048 pressure points.And talking about stylus, it doesnt need any kind of battery or anything.
One thing which I did notice when the product arrived was that there was a small white spot on the screen. The spot only becomes visible against a complete white background. I have checked on the internet and this is not a pixel problem but a small glitch during production. At the moment I am keeping the tablet as I am enjoying it very much. Also given the price, I am okay with having a minor issue, but if the spot gets bigger or worse, I will probably send it for warranty claim.

Edit: previously 4 -star due to white spot on LCD. I sent the product back for replacement. The replacement is expected to arrive in a day. Kudos to Samsung for an amazing product at amazing price and to Amazon for being extremely helpful with the replacement."
B01EUC7NPI,7,65,but my husband is a galaxy fan so I decided to try this tablet and it's awesome. It comes with some cute games that my ...,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,01-Feb-18,4,0,"I am (was?) a loyal Apple fan, but my husband is a galaxy fan so I decided to try this tablet and it's awesome. It comes with some cute games that my toddler likes, it has all the standard stuff you'd want from a tablet, and it's GREAT for reading comics, if you're into that. The battery lasts a long time too. I like it much better than my husband's iPad that I insisted he get back when he bought a tablet for himself. But he can never find out he was right and I was wrong."
B01EUC7NPI,7,66,Happier than I had expected.,L. M. Collins,5,Yes,25-Nov-17,2,0,"I decided that it was time to upgrade from hand writing notes and then transcribing them into my Laptop. I purchased this reasonably priced tablet with a pen to see if the technology had matured enough to make it practical. I have pretty high standards for technology and have never been particularly impressed by touchscreens and Stylus type pens. I reviewed all of the available options and believe that there are probably a few products few that have implemented the writing technology better, however for me this tablet perfectly meets my needs.

The tablet feels a little heavy when compared to simular apple product however the weight has not been an issue for me. The pre-loaded ""note taking"" app is not very good, because it doesn't allow me to configure it the way I want to use it; however there are plenty of good apps on Google.Play. There seems to be a lot fewer pre-installed apps on the tablet than there were on the other Samsung tablet that I own (still use for reading books and still love that one as well).

The battery life has been extremely good. I have not tried to run down to dead yet, so I can't validate Samsung battery claims.

So far, I am happier with this tablet than I had expected."
B01EUC7NPI,7,67,Not enough memory in this beast of a tablet.,Seana L Purvis,3,Yes,18-Nov-18,1,1,"Dear Amazon: Thanks for your prompt and quick delivery of this item. I got it Same Day. (Your delivery person was 30 minutes late -he arrived at 9:30 am, but no big.)

The Good:
Big, solid piece of technology. Felt weighty and very good in my hands.
Loved that there was a stored S Pen which worked just like the one on my Note 8. (The synchronization for Samsung Notes didn't hurt either. :)
Long, long battery life, and since it is a WiFi based tablet, this was a big deal .

I was excited. Thought I'd found a replacement for my S2 9.7. The improvements above were awesome.

The reasons I'm sending it back:

The Deal Breaker:
I woke up this morning to an ""Out of Space"" warning. My tablet was with me for ONE DAY and was out of space. I couldn't remove programs I wasn't using, and the 16MB the tablet came with had already been used up. That is a deal breaker for a power user like me, esp one who uses that tablet to help people and things. Running out of storage space on the first day, even WITH my great big storage card in there....well, that was profoundly disappointing.

Smaller tiny little ""man, I wished that worked differently"" reasons, which would have been livable except for See Above:
The hard keys are not backlit.
S Pen, although it mostly worked as advertised, sometimes would lag. (I""m thinking it is because of the Deal Breaker. Again, see above).

I got back online to see if there was a 32 GB version. And there is. Trouble is, it isn't warrantied in the US, and I""m not taking a risk on something shipped across either of the ponds.

Sigh.

So, back it goes. It is a wonderful tablet if you don't use it for business or need too much space. The SPen functionality is amazing, mostly, and the fact that it's stored on the tablet made me extra happy...until it didn't.

I will make one comment, however. There is a 32GB version that IS warrantied in the US. Trouble is, it's only an eight inch tablet. Since i have a six inch phone, previously mentioned, that's not going to be my next buy.

Dear Samsung: This beast of a tablet should have had a bigger stomach to go along with that monster battery and fun convenience factors. But since this one was made in 2016, I don't think you'll be listening to this suggestion.

Back to my S2 9.7, and back to praying someone comes up with another tablet hopefully soon.

Thanks for listening."
B01EUC7NPI,7,68,iPad Killer. Samsung does so many thing right with this Galaxy Tab A 10.1 with S-Pen SM-P580,Derwood Stephens,5,Yes,09-Aug-17,3,0,"This is truly the iPad killer.

If you are on the fence on whether to get the S-Pen or not, get the S-Pen version. It is an amazing value.
An additional 1 GB of RAM
The S-Pen itself
Apps to support the S-Pen are simply amazing

Why this over an iPad?
The cost - this is several hundred less than anything comparable to Apple.
S-Pen - This is a no-brainer. The S-Pen is so accurate. I'm not an artist, but use it for work to take notes.
You can easily circle things or draw arrows on images and send to colleagues. Any color, any style. I love using S Notes and Squid.
Using ""Write on PDF"" is awesome! Makes taking notes really easy. The Highlighter is indispensable.
Most programs know when your wrist is on the tablet and won't let it interfere with writing or drawing.
As soon as you pull the S-Pen the S-Pen apps show up. You can even take a quick note without logging in.
Split Screen - Works really well for most apps, except Facebook. You have to use m.facebook.com in a browser.
Apps - Supports most every app that you would use on an Apple tablet.
Files - You can rename and see all your files in the directories - local and on SD Card.
Icons - Move icons wherever you want. Don't let Apple tell you they all have to move up to the top.
Memory - Comes with 8 GB of on board storage for apps and docs, images, etc.
However; you can simply add an external SD Card (I used 128 GB) for all my movable apps, docs, images, etc.
No more having to delete movies and photos! Yay!
Photos - Allows you to take photos without entering pass code AND allows you to see only those photos without logging in. My iPad Air would allow me to take the photos, but I would have to log in to see them.

Cons ::
Can lag a bit if incoming notifications are trying to pop-up. Just turn most of them off and you won't have that issue.
If you use multiple email accounts, like me, and you have specific signature lines for each account, it will only use the default signature line, if you are emailing from another app using the SHARE function. Hopefully, Samsung will address this. Apple has it figured out.

Notes ::
Easy to hit the back button, if you're used to an iPad.
S-Pen that comes with it is really small, but you can upgrade to the Wacom Bamboo Smart. The pen is small, so it fits inside the Tab.
Limited number of cases available for this model, but I'm sure they'll be coming soon.

I am really pleased with the VALUE of this tablet."
B01EUC7NPI,7,69,"Very good tablet, so far. (2 mo in)",KM,5,Yes,14-Sep-18,1,0,"Ok, I've had this for just under 2 months, and so far, I love it.

PROS:
* Holds a charge very well. Using a few hrs/day, i go 2-3 days between charges.
* Lasts a long time on one charge. I use it on planes to watch videos for hours at a time. No problem.
* Great screen. Very crisp, clean images, and no pixelation on anything I've seen.
* Very responsive to the touch-pen I use to touch the screen. (no touch screen seems to recognize my fingers.)
* Headphone jacks work well, and so do the wireless headsets I got for it. Easy to pair.
* Charging plug fits snugly, and no issues so far with that.

CONS:
* It's quite large. Slap a protective cover in it, and it's really big. No more fitting it in your purse, for sure.
* The sound quality is OK in my opinion. Not great.

Overall, I love it. The sound is the only issue I have with it. I work in a loud environment, and sitting on planes is often quite loud, as well. This throttles the sound level down to stop you hurting your ears, which is good I suppose, but also prevents me turning it up loud enough to hear, when I'm working. I say go ahead and keep it low when the earbuds are on, but let it blast when I'm not using headsets. As to sound quality, it's OK for speech, but is lacking for music. I'm no expert, but I know when it sounds good, or not, and this allows you to listen to music, but you won't enjoy it much. I don't even try."
B01EUC7NPI,7,70,A great tablet,Fred D.,5,Yes,28-Feb-19,1,0,"I have hesitated for a long time about buying a tablet since my MacBook laptop is a great traveling computer. However, I really love my Galaxy android phone so I thought I would give the Tab A a try. I love it as much as my Galaxy phone. I does everything I need a tablet to do. I added a micro sd card for added storage and think this tablet is a great buy! The quality is great and the picture is great but the sound could be better. BUT, these tablets weren't meant to have theater quality sound. You can use a good quality headset or earbuds. The only other thing is the weight. I find it a little heavy especially with the ""stand"" type cover I bought, but the only time the weight becomes an issues is when reading a book and holding the tablet in one hand. This tablet syncs with my Google accounts on my Mac and my phone and will probably be my travel companion instead of my laptop. You can't beat the price. I highly recommend this product."
B01EUC7NPI,8,71,Simply brilliant!,Gustav Streicher,5,Yes,16-Feb-19,2,0,"Simply brilliant! Fantastic build quality. It is very responsive and has a great screen. The s-pen is super accurate and has pressure sensitivity. The tablet has great palm rejection. The s-pen does not detect tilt like some Ipad styli do, which is only somewhat important if you are a serious artist ( You can still create great works of art with it and it comes with the ArtRage app for free! ). I have used this tablet to go paperless as a student studying electrical engineering. I make all my class notes in an app called Squid ( It's like Notability, but for Android {squidnotes.com} ), and upload the files to Google Drive as PDFs, which is way easier than filing and managing physical notes. It even comes with 5 spare s-pen tips and tool to remove the tips.

Beware of buying tablet cases with magnets in them as this distorts the s-pen input in the area where the magnet is located. I use the tablet without a case for a better writing experience ( personal preference ), yet with a tempered glass screen protector (this does not influence the s-pen). I keep it safe by putting it in a tablet sleeve when I put it away and I have a mouse-pad like pad on which I place it when I use it. I modded the s-pen by putting a rubber from an old pen around it to make it feel like a real pen, since the s-pen is quite thin.

It comes with a charger block that supplies 2A at 5V, so make sure that you use a charger block with the same voltage output. The current (amperage) can be different, just keep in mind that it will charge slower if the current is lower, like in most phone charger blocks (usually 1A at 5V output)."
B01EUC7NPI,8,72,Good Screen Bad internal Speaker,Erasmo Gonzales,4,Yes,20-Feb-18,2,0,"Bought this when it went on sale for larger screen size. I was using an 8 inch LG Android tablet as I’m primarily a iPad user. It is light and the screen is bright with very nice size screen. Only problem, and I read this is an occurring problem with the Samsung Tab A is the internal speaker. Once in a while I can hear like a broken tweeter, or static. Hard to describe. Others who have had this problem are given suggestions like flash the tablet because it could be software related, or “your speaker is faulty”, or, “restart in ‘safe mode’ to see if an APP” is causing conflict. Too many options to pick from for me, I don’t care about the sound. I usually have the volume down, or headphones and I guess it is stillunder warranty so I’ll just keep it. I rate it 4 stars over all but give 2 stars or less for speaker."
B01EUC7NPI,8,73,Be cautious purchasing this product.,Cathleen Jungreis,2,Yes,10-May-18,4,0,"Very disappointing. Preloaded apps cannot be removed or moved to a sd card. 2 kids apps. Not helpful, when you don't have kids in the house anymore. News app, from a outlet that is not a station I would consider using for accurate information. It would be different if they gave options.
So, for the 16 g, you get about 7 to 8 g's of space.
The charging cord is so short, the tablet needs to be left on the floor to charge. Doesn't reach the desk.
I have used Samsung for many years, they no longer value their users. Will be rethinking purchasing another Samsung product. Phone or tablet. May even return this product."
B01EUC7NPI,8,74,"After buying my Samsung Galaxy Tab A I won't be buying a Windows platform PC, laptop, or tablet EVER AGAIN",Tripping Drummer,5,Yes,18-Jan-18,2,0,The screen resolution is unbeliviable on this 10.1-inch tablet. I spent a good portion of the day it arrived watching nature shows & tried a couple marvel movies the next day. No buffering or screen lag whatsoever. There is a bit of lag when playing Marvel Future Fight but it's minimal & the unit remains cool even after hours of play or internet use unlike my Galaxy S6 phone that heats up in 5 minutes. The battery lasts for around 16 hours with continual internet use but will lasts for several days with occassional daily use. When I put it in sleep mode it stays in sleep mode until I wake it up which will save on battery life. There is one thing that irks me though & it's the length of the charging cord. I can't find it right now but I think it's only 2' long. I was fortunate enough to own a Samsung Galaxy S6 phone which came with a 4' charging cord. I love Samsung products but their logic on the charging cord length just baffles me. At any rate it's only mildly annoying & doesn't change my opinion that this is best piece of technology I've owned to date so buy one & enjoy it also.
B01EUC7NPI,8,75,Watch what you buy.,Jim B,1,Yes,29-Aug-17,21,0,"The tablet itself is ok and an ok buy. This tablet was not a USA sold unit. It comes with foreign instruction and there is NO USA WARRANTEE! If I had known, I would have checked and NEVER have purchased it. BTW, they tell you that you can purchase a warranty at another site. The buyer will be aware with the next Amazon purchase."
B01EUC7NPI,8,76,None,Amazon Customer,3,Yes,03-Nov-18,5,0,"DO YOU THINK THE CONNECTION WIRE COULD BE ANY SHORTER? The connector should be stronger, they are flimsy and too short."
B01EUC7NPI,8,77,Perfect tablets for what I was looking for,Mora,5,Yes,11-May-18,1,0,"I purchased two of these after much research & comparison shopping. Have had them for a little over a month now with no issues or problems. I bought one for myself being fairly knowledgeable in tech, but by no means an expert. The other for a 70 year old who had little experience with ""modern technology"". They were extremely easy to set up & connect. The size is good, easy to read & watch videos. Screen is responsive to touch no pushing hard to work. Very fast response time when using & switching between applications. Camera takes clear pictures & videos. Many of the built-in apps were unnecessary easy to uninstall them. Installing apps is also easy with quick downloads. Email, social media, web, videos, movies etc. Basically everything one wants in a tablet has been easy-to-use & more importantly we've had no technical problems. I have been surprised (happily) at how quickly the 70 year old has caught on to using this tablet. The tablet is rather intuitive which has helped him to more easily navigate & understand what he's doing. After explaining the basics like what an app is & how to get them, setting up email & how to use it, YouTube & searching for videos, finding games & downloading them & using Google to find just about anything. He became quite self sufficient in using this tablet within a few weeks. I definitely recommend this Samsung 10 for those looking for a good easy to use quality tablet."
B01EUC7NPI,8,78,2nd samsung tablet,mbr0wn,2,Yes,03-Jan-19,1,0,"I bought the first Samsung tablet after my NOOK died. It was a bit larger and lasted about 5 years, the began to have issues. Since I liked it so much, I decided on another Samsung. Shortly after my purchase, I began to have issues. (I bought the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1) The issue was with the sound and earbuds. The sound stopped. The only way I could get the sound back was if I shut the tablet down and restarted it. The second problem was with the touch. The screen does not respond to tapping very well, like I had to constantly tap tap tap to get it to work. So, I am disappointed. I finally broke down and asked to send the tablet back. "" Amazon will credit me when I receive it"" I'm not sure if I should buy another one or try a different brand. Anyhow, I'm without a tablet at the moment, and a bit disappointed."
B01EUC7NPI,8,79,Great for price,Amanda williams,5,Yes,21-Dec-18,2,0,"I looked around at other tablets and as an avid Samsung person I chose to go the cheaper Samsung route. Bought it on black friday so it was even cheaper than I thought it would have been. Great purchase! I use it mainly just for the internet, facebook and amazon. So I haven't really tested all of its capabilities. It does have great battery life!! I don't use it a ton, but it stays charged for a really long time. If you are looking for a tablet for little use and just for random things here and there, I would definitely recommend this one !"
B01EUC7NPI,8,80,Not super user friendly as it could be,welder314,3,Yes,29-Jul-18,1,0,"I had to get a couple of these for kiosk use at my work. I don't particularly like them, as the menus are not intuitive and they are not organized well. The fact that it has a 'developer mode' makes me realize that this the OS is continuously in beta, and never a finished product. Wifi drops out randomly, and occasionally won't reconnect. I've only used it with one app (the one we use for the kiosk), so I can't comment on things like memory usage, etc. We use a generic tablet pen so that users with fat fingers can easily push the small buttons (bad kiosk app), and that works well.

The camera, screen and touch functions work as expected, and seem to have quality on par with most other similar devices. Fit and finish are very good. Overall a decent device, but it is not as plug-and-play as something like an Apple device. My review is from the perspective of somebody who just wants to use the tablet. If you are looking at it from a tech aspect - the ability to program, etc. - you may have a 5 star impression of it."
B01EUC7NPI,9,81,Go Samsung!,happy gal,5,Yes,16-Jun-18,2,0,"This is my first tablet and exceeds my expectations. I'm a desktop and smartphone user but it will take time to get used to the tablet. It functions on Android so it shouldn't be too difficult to conquer. I like the crisp, clear display and colors appear true. It has a blue light for night users, ringtone alert choices, adjustable fonts, and more. It's very flexible and customizable to taste. Samsung makes good products. My son has had a Galaxy for many years now and doesn't want or need a new one. I went on his recommendation. I also like the ability to upload information from your cellphone to your tablet via Google."
B01EUC7NPI,9,82,Great for power outages,Tylerrrr,5,Yes,26-Oct-17,4,0,Since I have a pc I don’t use it very as often as I’d expected but if I didn’t have a pc I would use it all the time. Decent screen (720p) good battery life and it has the option to expand storage with a microsd Card. I threw a 32gb card in there which is enough for a few movies. GREAT for when the power goes out. Pair it up with a nice usb power brick and you’re golden. Not to mention the price is great compared to say an iPad.
B01EUC7NPI,9,83,What an amazing tablet!,Chazbo,5,Yes,06-Oct-17,4,0,"Received my Galaxy Tab a couple days ago. What an amazing tablet!!! Because I already have the Galaxy S5 smart phone, the transition to the tablet was a breeze...very intuitive.
Boots up quickly and I was amazed at the screen sharpness.
Battery life is much better than expected, although it does take awhile to fully charge the battery.
It's best to order the screen protector along with the cover case when you order the tablet.
Overall...I'd give this tablet an A+"
B01EUC7NPI,9,84,"Very good tablet, especially for the price",Bustervox321,5,Yes,04-Oct-17,4,0,"Very good tablet, especially for the price, easy to set up, I had an older model Samsung, I just had to log into gmail and my Samsung account and it even transferred my pictures and even my wallpaper to this tablet, good picture quality, the camera is an improvement from the older one, I use Facebook video calling a lot, the picture is much clearer,noticed it right away, not an expert but I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking to buy,"
B01EUC7NPI,9,85,Use it more than a laptop,jwalenta,5,Yes,17-Nov-18,3,0,"Purchased this about a year ago. My 1st tablet at the age of 54. Absolutely love it. Never thought I'd use it more than my laptop, but I do. Nice screen, great battery life, no complaints whatsoever. Pack the tablet and Bose SoundLink III for vacations and both will last all day on the beach. Highly recommend."
B01EUC7NPI,9,86,Stopped charging and working in only 3 months,Sue,2,Yes,30-Jan-18,4,0,"Very upset. All of a sudden,my tablet has stopped charging despite getting a new charger. Also will not charge with wireless charger. I have only had the tablet for 3 months. I am now using my 2014 Note. I had bought the Tab A when the Note would not charge but a new charger solved that issue. It still continues to work well. Very disappointed in the Tab A."
B01EUC7NPI,9,87,Disappointed,yazzy,3,Yes,09-Sep-16,10,1,Sorry but I don't get all these write reviews on keeps freezing up acting crazy and I will probably send it back since I did purchase insurance
B01EUC7NPI,9,88,Great tablet for the price range,AddisonJ,5,Yes,13-Feb-18,2,0,"I have owned a 10"" Lenovo Tablet for several years. It has been a very good device. The Android version was not being updated any longer so I decided to gift it to my 9 year old daughter and try a new tablet. I wanted one with a stylus. I own other Samsung devices so I decided to try their tablet. I'm impressed with the performance for the price range. I really like the stylus feature. The pen itself is a bit on the small side but is functional. The battery life is very good and the video quality is much better than others I have reviewed. It's a good value tablet if you are looking for stylus input capability. One tid bit of information for potential buyers. It charges best when turned off."

What a boomer, I've been buying samsung products for some years and that the first time anything like this has happened. Amazon is sending a replacement 10 1 I just hope it's better than the first one. And i receive the second tablet and it wasn't no good as well, it to was restarting every 5 to 10 minutes. I don't know weather Amazon is selling used samsung 10.1 tab A for new tablet, but samsung need to check up on what Amazon doing with there products that's gonna stop customers like me from buying samsung products."

B01EUC7NPI,10,91,Like a massive galaxy note that doesn't fit in your pocket,Rpg,4,Yes,27-Sep-18,1,0,"This is for the Tab A with S Pen

I ordered a black one from warehouse deals and it was working great. I usually use android devices with headphones or something attached with audio, but on some rare instances I like to use the speakers. Well, the warehouse deals one had speakers that skipped on me while watching random videos and playing games. I returned it and just got new version. No problems with the speakers. Definitely keep in mind that the 16gb internal memory can get used really fast. Also, some apps don't have permissions to let you move them to an external memory storage. Overall though, the S Pen was the real reason of getting this for the drawing apps on the go."
B01EUC7NPI,10,92,Exceptionally Functional Tablet and the battery life is just awesome!,Paul Jo,5,Yes,12-Sep-18,-,0,"Although I buy a ton of products from Amazon, I seldom write a product review but this one is another exception! Simply, I love this Samsung tablet because it surpassed my expectation! I've been using Samsung Note 10.1 for about five years before the memory crashed, according to a local technician. So, naturally, I went to Amazon to look for a replacement (my Samsung Note 10.1 was purchased from Amazon). I was a bit skeptic about getting this tablet because the price was considerably lower than the Note 10.1 that is currently out in the market but I WAS WRONG! Upon receiving, I charged the tablet, turned it on, went through a quick (no hassle) setup. It's super fast, very functional, a great display, feels very solid and sturdy (well-designed, also) and, the battery life, I must say, is exceptionally long! I'm going to return later in a few months to offer my updated review but, so far, I'm very pleased with this new Samsung tablet, including the S Note with pen, which is the signature feature for the Samsung tablet (and one of the primary reasons that I went with Samsung over other tablets). Overall, I'd highly recommend this tablet to anyone who is really looking for a great tablet that you can use it on a daily basis to meet your computing and other needs!"
B01EUC7NPI,10,93,Great Media Consumption / Art Creation Device.,Chris,5,Yes,24-Jul-17,2,0,"I love this thing! I've primarily used it so far for media consumption and drawing, though I do occasionally use it for writing (though it's not nearly as nice to type on as a laptop).

The pressure-sensitive stylus is a bit narrow for my tastes, but I've just ended up modifying my grip to use it. I'll be buying an aftermarket stylus when I can - one that has dimensions closer to a traditional pen.

Battery life has been great. The speakers are fantastic, and the built-in headphone jack is a plus! Though you also have the option to use Bluetooth headphones / speakers as well. It's quite nice.

I also really like how the charge port and heafphone jack are on the same end of the tablet. Much easier to deal with than having a cable coming out of each end.

Palm rejection has been working great for me in Medibang Paint on this thing."
B01EUC7NPI,10,94,LOOKS REALLY NICE...,Rache^l Clark,4,Yes,22-Oct-18,1,0,"Galaxy Tab A came on time as advertised. It had 56% battery life, which was needed for all the set up and download of my personal apps. Still have 41% remaining. I like the white edges. The charging cord is only 31"" from end-to-end, so a little short. I don't know why they can't make them longer. Sorry I can't give anymore information than that, as I just took it out of the box and set it all up.
UPDATE 10/26/2018: Now had tablet for a few days. Still works well, only takes a little longer to charge. It did not come with a fast charging cord/charger. (Don't know if they are not as good for the electronics as standard chargers). But even when I leave the tablet on and don't use it overnight, it still has a pretty good charge by morning. So we'll see...."

I originally got the galaxy tab a 8 inch the latest version 2017 model but in about 30 minute of playing with it, i decided to return it why because its only 730p who wants that ppi in 2018? Not me for sure and its optimized to run most vidoes on youtube at 420p and i was like oooh hell no and i said you going back home tomorrow as soon as ups opens. But this one has full hd 1080p or higher resolution and its built like a champion. Everything about is so smooth and likeable."
B01EUC7NPI,10,96,Nice tablet for the price you pay,Rasika Dahanayake,5,Yes,09-Apr-18,2,0,"Nice tablet for the price you pay. I searched around a lot before buying this tablet and i finally decided this was the best tablet within my budget and im not disappointed. I use this tablet to take notes in classes and to write on text book pdf's. The Screen is 1080p, and nice quality. not having a ultraHD Screen will increase the battery life, and it shows because with normal use the battery lasts about 5 days. The 10.1 inch screen is perfect for note taking as it is close in size to a actual notebook. The tablet is not too thin and not too thick making it perfect size to hold comfortably. I am happy with the processor speed and the RAM they are good for a mid range tablet. The camera is low quality but then again i never use the tablets rear view camera, but it would be useful to have a nice front facing camera to use video chat.
Negatives would be the lack of memory, 16GB is not enough and you cannot install apps in the SD memory to save space. The s-pen stylus is too thin, if you keep writing for a long time you will not be comfortable. Better to buy a separate stylus if you a heavy stylus user. The weight of the Tablet will tire your arms out fast if you are reading books."
B01EUC7NPI,10,97,"After 9 months, the driver died. I now have a heavy paperweight.",C. Roehrs,1,Yes,29-Oct-18,1,0,"I mistakenly purchased this Tab A unaware that lighter and better models existed. After the short return time expired, I purchased another lighter model (for traveling) thinking, 'well, I can use the Tab A around the house'.... Except you can't because the Tab A is too heavy to easily manipulate or hold lying down. Worse, after nine months, this product doesn't recognize any file transfers to my Mac, giving me an error message stating that the cord (even though it is new, and even though I also used the other new cord purchased from Samsung) is not recognized. As such, it's impossible to transfer files from my Mac to this piece of junk. Countless frustrating hours of conducting all of the standard trouble-shooting has failed, and I am now left with a heavy paperweight."
B01EUC7NPI,10,98,Best tablet I have ever owned!,Carolyn J. Hooton,5,Yes,14-Sep-17,2,0,"Love it love it, love it. Don't waste your money on other so called tablets/mini computers. This tablet meets all your needs, and then some. The screen is large enough where you don't need a keyboard, and the display is exceptional! I had purchased a less expensive ""mini computer"", and after a few weeks, it wouldn't even turn on. However, I had already purchased an accessory item for it ( a 10"" case with a stylus, headphones, and some connection items), and, even though I'd returned the computer, I was able to use the case for my Samsung Tablet. My phone is an Android, and that is the only type of cellphone I will ever use. This tablet compliments it, and I can transfer all the data from my phone to my tablet. Fantastic buy! :)"
B01EUC7NPI,10,99,Great tablet - just too much bloatware,S. Tressler,4,Yes,25-Jun-18,3,0,"This has been a great tablet. That said, I wish Samsung would not bundle so much junk software that I do not need and cannot be removed. This prevented me from giving it 5 stars. Movies look great on this device, and the battery life is excellent. Get a microSD for it, and you will be all set."
B01EUC7NPI,10,100,Absolutely love this tablet.,Susan,5,Yes,07-Nov-17,3,0,I absolutely love this tablet! I have been using samsung products for several years and none of them have disappointed me yet! This size is makes it easy to see things and the graphics are great. The processing system is plenty fast for everything I need. It works well on my wifi and with my bluetooth devices. All the the controls and features are set up the same as my phone so it's very easy for me to navigate around. I will definitely continue to be a dedicated samsung customer.
B01EUC7NPI,11,101,Great first impressions - 10.1' w/ S pen,Boberto,5,Yes,28-Nov-18,1,0,"It has been only a few days so far. So very limited experience with it.
I got it as a gift for my artistic wife. She absolutely loves the PENUP app and the S pen! Apps are responsive with the 3GB RAM. Camera image quality isn't the greatest, but that wasn't the reason I bought it. Definitely exceeds my expectations for a $200 (Black Friday deal) figure.
This won't be used for any games, so no idea about the 3D rendering power.
HD videos are great, especially with an anti-glare screen protector (sold elsewhere).

If anything goes wrong, I will come back and update my review."
B01EUC7NPI,11,102,7 months old - Black/Flickering Screen. Should have stuck with an ipad,Cheryl W.,1,Yes,26-Jul-18,2,0,"Garbage product. Screen black and flickering (known/common issue). Took a chance on this and I guess you get what you pay for. This tablet was lightly used for drawing and web browsing. Always kept in a VERY protective case like all my tablets/phones. I’ve always valued Apple products for their reliability and now I see why. 7 months in and this Samsung tablet is worthless. Usually buy the protection plan;however, the 2 year protection plan was $70 (30% of total product cost). I guess that should have been a dead giveaway.

I have a 2nd gen iPad that still works after 7 years (maybe more) although slow as molasses, but it still works. Will not trust Crapsung quality anymore for phones, tablets or TV’s. Buyers beware. Just google search “galaxy tab a flickering screen”"
B01EUC7NPI,11,103,Powerful big tablet,Lunix,5,Yes,09-Mar-18,1,0,"I ordered today (2018-03-09), got it this evening (thanks, Amazon). It's big and heavy, but with good reason. This thing packs a whallop! It's very fast, seems to have long battery life (I need to play with it more). Great screen (I'll have it outside in the daylight tomorrow, so I will see how it stands up to that). 16GB isn't much storage, but I don't need much. I added a 64GB SD card (a very fast PNY). So all my data is on that. I will update my review after I have spent more time with this. While I had just a couple of apps running, there was only about 640MB of RAM free. That's probably okay since the apps were the two I use most. But I run an octa-core Linux server with 2GB of RAM and an Exynos processor. That only uses about 550MB of RAM to serve files (SAMBA and NFS), web pages, MySQL."
B01EUC7NPI,11,104,Don't buy this tablet,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,13-Oct-18,2,0,"After about 6 months the tablet doesn't want to charge and I have to play with the charger to get it just right each time. Now it is ten months later and it's not charging at all. Customer support is awful, I tried doing a chat and I kept getting asked for my email, which I don't want to provide. Awful product, this is the second Samsung tablet I have had this issue with, the reason I replaced my last one, I'm so disappointed."
B01EUC7NPI,11,105,Great for artists on the go but not great for anything else,Amazon Customer,3,Yes,17-Oct-18,2,0,"The sound quality is especially bad. The memory is already too low and the SD card is not a great option as most programs can't be put on there. To make matters worse, what little memory you get is loaded with bloatware that you cannot get rid of so you don't have that much memory to work with. After installing a few apps, you're basically out of memory."
B01EUC7NPI,11,106,Excellent tablet!,customer1029384756,5,Yes,13-Nov-17,3,0,"Excellent tablet. Amazing battery life. Decent camera. Android 7.0.

The provided pen is a little small and uncomfortable to use for extended periods, but any wacom pen will work! I had one from a previous convertible laptop that works flawlessly. If the SPen is docked the tablet will not recognize other pens by default, but there is a setting to turn this function off so the tablet is constantly looking for a pen, but this will decrease battery life. I haven't tested by how much yet."
B01EUC7NPI,11,107,Great Everyday Tablet! Lower quality camera.,Emily Kosterman,5,Yes,27-Dec-18,1,0,"I read reviews for so many tablets before I bought this one and it's living up to the hype! It's a great little tablet for all around use. I bought it because I didn't have a computer and writing on my phone is hard. This screen is just the right size though. The sound isn't quite as loud as I thought it would be (my phone is ultra loud), but headphones work nicely and it has Bluetooth capability if you really need to pump up the speakers. I'm still getting used to the back and home buttons at the bottom, which are backwards to my phone's, but that's not a problem. The charging port is on the top, next to the headphone jack. That was a surprise! But it's a nice plug-in and isn't wobbly or cheap like some. The screen is decently bright, ultra crisp, and you have a nice amount of space around it to hold the tablet without getting your fingers on the screen itself. :) The S pen is really fun. Lots of options to play with. I definitely recommend this tablet! The only downside to the whole thing is the camera. It's definitely not the best quality so I stick to my phone's camera. It also comes preinstalled with Google and Samsung apps, which I find annoying because I don't have an account with either one, but it's easy to disable what you don't want (you can't actually uninstall them without a full root, and I'm not that technically advanced). Of the bunch, I use only maps, email (you can connect your own to the Gmail template, that's nice), and YouTube. For my purposes, it's the perfect thing! I'm actually way too distracted with the fun aspects of the tablet to sit down and write, but the little I have, it's worked like a dream. I heartily recommend this tablet to anyone!"
B01EUC7NPI,11,108,Excellent discount tablet,EDURP,4,Yes,24-Sep-17,3,0,"This is an excellent tablet for those not wanting to break the bank but still get good performance and longevity. It's not a high performance tablet so gaming and excessive use might have more lag than most want. For my uses of emails, web browsing, and apps its perfect. I use it as a travel for work and it fits my needs and prevents me from carrying a 15lb laptop. I've had it for 8 months now and it's still working as good as the day I got it."
B01EUC7NPI,11,109,Buy a 256gb micro SD card to go with it. You'll be glad you did!,Classy Keys,5,Yes,27-Aug-18,1,1,"Our first tablet, so nothing to compare it with. However, it suits our needs. My husband and I both have Samsung phones, so the interface is familiar. We are sharing so made sure to setup two different users so we don't have to log-in and out of each of our apps. We purchased a 256GB micro SD card, but found out after much research that Samsung has disabled the feature on this model to automatically have apps download to the card. We manually moved our apps from internal memory to the card. We also purchased a bluetooth keyboard and case. We are happy with this purchase."
B01EUC7NPI,11,110,After my first review saddly have to say that he battery last only 8 months! A battery replacement cannot be shipped to Hawaii!,Coha92,2,Yes,26-Dec-17,2,0,"Excellent product. I bought another tablet because someone told and show me the WhatsApp app in a Samsung Galaxy Tablet. When I tried to download the app I got the same message that I got in my other tablet ""the app is not compatible with your device"". After a good research I was able to download it.
Now I'm connected easily by phone, video, messages, texts, etc. FREE with family and friends around the world.
I've been having a little trouble taking pictures with the camera (no issues with video) I think a little research will resolve my issues.
I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!"
B01EUC7NPI,12,111,Very nice except the screen resolution is so tight that text ...,Larry G. Buchanan,4,Yes,25-Jun-17,4,0,Very nice except the screen resolution is so tight that text is so small it can be difficult to read. Tight screen resolution is awesome for graphics. I personally would like this tablet better if it's width dimension was the same as the Galaxy Tab A 9.7. I purchased this 10.1 Galaxy Tab A expecting it to be same width as the 9.7 and simply taller. Surprise.
B01EUC7NPI,12,112,Great Tablet.,Brandon,5,Yes,09-Dec-17,2,0,"Great device, I have used the device for over 1 week. So far good. Nice build quality. Great display, camera, and sound. I would recommend a case for this tablet. The device kept slipping out my had, once I purchased a case I no longer had any issues.

It's Android/Samsung... I use this device mostly to watch videos, search the web, and play music. Really easy to use. Also the device has a Great battery life over 5 days before needing a charge.

Not heavy at all, also I purchased and SD card for extra Memory."
B01EUC7NPI,12,113,PERFECT for drawing on the go!,Kim.B,5,Yes,29-Aug-18,1,0,"I got this tablet because I wanted to draw on the go and omg it's perfect! I love it!

The picture quality is great even when I zoom in into the picture the pixels are barely noticeable. The S-pen works great, there isn't any lag that I've noticed so far, my only problem is that it's really small and can cause some pains in your hand after a hour or so. There are other pens out there that you can buy for about $30-70 if that's a problem for you, I just got used to it and took breaks. ( Also note that the regular Tab A doesn't support the S-pen you need to get this one if you want to use it ) I've only had this tablet for a month and I've already drawn about 50+ things so far lol.
I've watched a few things on it and again really clear picture, the sound without headphones though is kinda muffled so if you want to watch something I suggest some head phones. I haven't tried the cam yet from that I've seen it's decent.

If anyone out there is looking for a cheap portable ( The cheapest I've seen it being $230!) this is perfect! Just download Medi-bang (which has cloud support so you can take those drawings and transfer them to your pc!) and your set ~"
B01EUC7NPI,12,114,Perfect for school!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,13-Oct-18,1,0,"I hand write all of my notes because it's better for retention. I wanted a tablet that wasn't going to break the bank, but would allow me to write and organize my notes in one place.
The Tab A with the S pen does exactly what I need it to do. The screen is big enough that I can split it between one note and whatever power point, pdf, or web page I'm using for my notes, but small enough that it doesn't really weigh down my bag.
The battery life on it is VERY good. I can get away with charging it once a week most of the time (i'll have the screen on for 3-4hrs for lecture, and any additional time I use outside of class, along with the occasional netflix watching ;) )

I also really love that full web pages are displayed, as opposed to mobile sites (which is a god send because blackboard's mobile site doesn't work that well)

All in all, I would absolutely recommend this to someone who was looking for a tablet to bring to class."
B01EUC7NPI,12,115,Awesome tablet,Stugi,5,Yes,27-Nov-18,-,0,"Compared to the older Samsung tablets. This thing is a beast. The battery life on this superb, the kids used this on a long drive to Houston to Colorado Springs and it held up extremely well. If it runs low on battery, it charges pretty quickly. The pen is nice to have especially if you like to draw or color and it also has an SD card slot to load pictures or movies (I have a 200 GB sandisk on mine). The sound is decent, could be better but with headphones on then you don't have to worry. Using applications like google chrome or youtube worked flawlessy, its a great device to watch movies or browse the web when a smartphone screen won't do. Another good thing is this weighs so little, at a little over a pound, this thing works so well i might buy another one."
B01EUC7NPI,12,116,Great everyday tablet,Laina L.,4,Yes,11-Nov-18,-,0,"So far it's a great all around everyday tablet. I like the build quality and the size. The battery life so far is excellent. The camera is decent, but it's a tablet so honestly it'll probably never get used. I like that it has stereo sound but it's stupid that both speakers are to the right when held in landscape mode. The only thing I really dislike is that the screen doesn't get bright enough in my opinion, but I'm used to AMOLED screens. It's not the fastest device out there, lags some while gaming, but for the price it's great. I got the version that did not come with the pen and I kind of regret it now, it seems that it doesn't work with the pen at all. I tried one I had and it doesn't work, so the digitizer must not be present. So just be warned if you want the pen, you have to buy the one that comes with it."
B01EUC7NPI,12,117,"It's great, but ...",Barbara Greer,4,Yes,01-Dec-18,1,1,"Don't get me wrong, I love the Samsung tablet. It has great picture and fairly good sound. The only thing wrong I've noticed is that, on occasion, I get this sound from the speakers that is a scratching noise or like some interference or feedback. Hard to describe the sound and haven't figured out the cause as it is random. Other than that, I've had no issues with it and am thoroughly enjoying having the S pen and the larger screen."
B01EUC7NPI,12,118,Good little tablet for simple browsing & media,ingway,5,Yes,02-Sep-18,1,0,"Good little tablet for simple browsing & media, not necessarily for gaming today. Perfect for holding massive libraries with all of the functionality of the Android OS. I use this to hold all of my ebooks and comics primarily - but it's also just a great basic tablet for browsing, reference, video streaming and such. Great quality product from Samsung again. It's certainly not cutting edge in 2018 - but for an affordable introduction to owning a tablet - it's rather good."
B01EUC7NPI,12,119,All you can ask for in a tablet.,Ralph C. Browne,5,Yes,17-Jan-18,1,0,When. I bought this I didn't knowa thing about tablets. Had to get something when my computer died and my nephews said get one of threse...a Samsung Galaxy tab A. Helped it was on sale too. Had lots on memory cards from my cameras so didn't need to buy more. It works very well like a laptop and does everything a computer does. Lots of free apps too. Only thing I wish it would have had is some kind of basic insructions to give some idea how to use it. Fortunately I have younger relatives t help me out. Great tablet at a great price. Check it out. The 10.1 in screen is nice too.
B01EUC7NPI,12,120,Great tablet that does everything you need at a fraction of the cost of an I-Pad,Frank DLT,5,Yes,29-Sep-18,2,0,"Bought this one for my wife, as I've had one for a couple of years. This one has the more elongated screen and the image really pops out. The sound is about what you'd expect on it, and it takes great pictures. It is very responsive and has good wifi connectivity. No complaints. In fact, I've recommended it to others."
B01EUC7NPI,13,121,EASY START UP & EASY TO USE,Dad Erson,5,Yes,05-Jul-18,1,1,"Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T580NZKAXAR 10.1-Inch 16 GB, Tablet (Black)
I wanted something bigger than my phone to keep up with email, Facebook, and a few other low key things I do that do not need huge computing power. This device let me sync up with my network, my Google account, etc., and I can take it around the house and not be tied to my computer...simpler and cheaper than a laptop. Since my phone is Samsung, it was easy to start up and get going. Have had only a week, but there are no issues and makes social media and email easier, as well as surfing the web."
B01EUC7NPI,13,122,"No bloatware that I can tell, the battery life ...",Phillip S. Main,5,Yes,14-Aug-17,5,0,"No bloatware that I can tell, the battery life is insane, I get 3-4 days per charge while using it heavily."
B01EUC7NPI,13,123,I got it at a great deal from Amazon and have been using it more ...,T. U.,5,Yes,25-Jan-18,1,0,"I have owned two tablets from other manufacturers in the past but this one brought me the real and professional experience that was missing in those two. It's sleek, fast, intuitive and packed with everything a user could ever ask for and yet, was extremely affordable. I got it at a great deal from Amazon and have been using it more often than I thought I would. I have not had any problems with it at all, and being a Samsung, I don't expect any. Compared to similar-sized tablets from other entities, this beats them hands down in style, performance and affordability."
B01EUC7NPI,13,124,Screen Shut Off is Due to Magnet on Case,J-Bo,5,Yes,07-Aug-18,1,0,The tablet screen would randomly go blank constantly. I've read other reviewers say the same thing. I thought it was a faulty tablet until I took it out of the case I had it in. It worked perfectly outside the case. The case I purchased had a flap that flipped over from back to front and attached via magnet to the front. The magnet messed with the tablet. Bought a case that attached at the corners instead of in the middle and no more issues. It's a great tablet now that it works and doesn't black out all the time.
B01EUC7NPI,13,125,so if you're the type that uses your phone for everything it's a great choice.,Matt Grenier,5,Yes,18-Feb-17,5,0,"Bought it for my wife as a valentines day present and she absolutely loves it. It's basically a giant cell phone, so if you're the type of person that uses your phone for everything it's a great choice."
B01EUC7NPI,13,126,Good cheap tablet; not for graphically intensive games,ki no,5,Yes,11-Apr-18,1,0,"I wanted a cheap 10 inch tablet, and this is it. It plays H264 and H265 encoded 1080p videos with ease. Game-wise, it behaves like a midrange tablet/phone from a couple of years ago...so it can't handle max graphics in graphically intensive games. I'm not a pen guy so I rarely use it, but it's pretty cool that it can do calligraphy. No issues...I would have wanted a newer one but Samsung really moved to mid/high end for their more current 10 inch tablets (with a price to match the mid/high end hardware)."
B01EUC7NPI,13,127,Always On feature quality tied to the tablet case,luvpasteis,5,Yes,08-Jun-17,3,0,"I purchased this and thought I would return it as the Always On feature was acting up, or so I thought. What I found to be the problem was the rotating case with a large hole on the back that I had ordered and really liked. I ordered another case where they indicated that the tablet would light up when the case cover was opened and shut off when closed. It worked perfectly! To think I almost returned this because I thought it was defective."
B01EUC7NPI,13,128,Great Tablet!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,30-Nov-18,-,0,"This item replaced an older Samsung tablet that I was very fond of but stopped charging properly. The new tablet is great and works predictably. I am enjoying the resolution and the S Pen. I would definitely recommend the S Pen!

I use my tablet when I need to answer emails away from my computer or look up information on the Internet. I also use it to capture ideas and take care of light typing chores. I can see that this tablet has even more uses...and it is fun to explore what it is capable of doing.

I also purchased a Flintie case with a keyboard. I would also recommend that."
B01EUC7NPI,13,129,the only thing that I didn't like was that this new device came with a 32GB ...,Jevon,5,Yes,15-Jan-18,4,0,"Having purchased the Tab A 10.1 with stylus for myself and then the Tab A 10.1 without stylus for a friend, the only thing that I didn't like was that this new device came with a 32GB -10 series micro sd and the previous one didn't. This was however another great purchase of another great Samsung product."
B01EUC7NPI,13,130,Perfect for Me,Cheyenne,5,Yes,09-Jan-19,1,0,"I bought this originally to replace my Kindle Fire as it is getting on in years and doesn't have as much memory or functionality anymore. I have a Samsung Galaxy cellular device as well, so I thought this would be a great fit for me and my needs as a tablet. I use it as my computer and as my television and so far I am very impressed. This was a great purchase for me and a wonderful early birthday present to myself."
B01EUC7NPI,14,131,More like a smart phone than a tablet which doesn't have a phone,Desert Rat,4,Yes,09-May-18,1,0,"Nice tablet with a 10.1 inch screen. It is set up primarily for using in the portrait mode which is unusual for a tablet this size. It is not a phone, it is a tablet. My older Samsung tablet is designed to work in the landscape mode which is preferable over portrait with a large screen. It works very well and charges up quickly although I would have preferred the newer USB connectors that you can plug in anyway instead of determining the which side is up."
B01EUC7NPI,14,132,S Pen feature does not work,jimmy,3,Yes,02-Feb-18,-,0,"Tablet is excellent, however the S pen feature does not work and has not worked since purchase in Sept 2017. Have talked with Samsung tech support 7 times or more and their corrections did not work. Even tried factory reset with no success in correcting problem. Returned tablet to Samsung repair in Nov-Dec 2017 and they did not correct problem - in fact the repair sheet said they fixed LCD which was not the problem. Tried Samsung tech support a few more times and tried new pens 2 more times. Samsung wants me to return the table again for their repair, but I will just give up. We use the tablet daily and don't want to go without out for another 10 day period while they troubleshoot. I asked for them to send me a new tablet and I would return the one I now have, but they said that was against their policy. Bad policy to have to repeatedly return a product when they failed to address the problem the first time. I have 2 Samsung phones, 2 Samsung tablets, and Samsung refrigerator, however they are resisting common sense and customer alignment. So, we will do without the S Pen feature. Such is life. James"
B01EUC7NPI,14,133,Really Fantastic Tablet,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,28-Nov-17,1,0,"We purchased this tablet to help my 3 year old daughter who is behind where she should be educationally. It's a beautiful tablet that can be expanded to 256 gig. There is a kids mode which is basically an Android launcher with built in kids apps that allows us as parents to add and subtract apps as necessary. I've dabbled with it some. I'm an ipad/kindle fire lover but I am incredibly impressed with the Samsung tablet and love the pencil also. It's small and ideal for my daughter to use. It's fast, speakers are great, really i have nothing but great things to say."

Easily Rootable,Sky Tripp-Schaefer,5,Yes,22-Jan-19,1,0,"Material quality picture quality sound quality it's all here and with XDA I actually am running pie on this device very easily rootable, would recommend this tablet to anyone yes it's more expensive you get what you paid for this is a glass screen a pretty good camera and incredible battery life. Battery lasts at least 12 hours of continuous use with screen at half brightness!! ..."
B01EUC7NPI,14,135,So glad I got this tablet! 6 stars!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,07-Jun-17,9,0,"I purchased this to use for taking notes in school with the S Pen, which it does flawlessly in conjunction with OneNote. The pen writes smoothly with virtually no lag, and is exactly what I hoped it would be. I am training myself to avoid clicking the button on the pen while writing, which is very mildly annoying, but not enough so to be a problem.
The battery can take ages to reach a full charge, but I actively use the tablet all day to take notes and then do my assignments on it at home, and it lasts all day with heavy usage. I let it charge overnight, and it is ready to go again the next day.
I've been using it for about 3 weeks, and couldn't be happier with it.
Tip: Download an app that triggers an alarm if you don't replace the S Pen. I use S Pen Keeper, but there may be others that better suite your needs."
B01EUC7NPI,14,136,"Good tab, but you can't purchase s-pen separately and make it work for this",AA,5,Yes,29-Dec-17,1,0,"Best tab in it's range, purchased this as a gift and she loves it! Please note however that this was the version without S-pen, and purchasing an s-pen separately won't work. For some funny reason, the hardware technology on the version with s-pen and without s-pen are not the same. I did not find out until I had purchased it. However, I downloaded the inkredible app and purchased the MEKO universal stylus. Inkredible seems to have a palm reject technology which works for light-notes-taking needs. Other than that the tab works great."
B01EUC7NPI,14,137,What good is a tab that stops charging.,Asana-gi,2,Yes,27-Nov-18,-,0,"Loved it until it flat stopped charging today, less than 4 months after buying it and using Square Trade Ins twice only to have it fail a third time after getting it back. It simply goes flat despite being connected. I now assume it does not like my a) cord or b) charger or both and neither Sansung or Square Trade addresses this possible issue. So I am going to call Samsung to order a ""correct"" version of each as Square Trade must have them as they manage to revive my dead device a d figure out if this is the issue. Samsung chargers are very much alike with no marking to ID for which device they are made, and definitely not the cords."
B01EUC7NPI,14,138,Great tablet!,M. Roberts,5,Yes,27-Nov-18,-,0,"I bought this for work. Using it for meetings, email. Microsoft excel , word, I also use onenote a lot on this works great. I added a keyboard with case & it's a great tool.
Ive used it to watch vudu HDX videos works great for that too. This is probably the closest thing to a laptop replacement I've ever used. Even when I'm home I find myself teaching for this tablet instead of my laptop.
Only thing I wish was different was speaker placement they should be on the front bezel after all you'll be looking at the screen right? Why they don't do that is beyond me there's room for them."
B01EUC7NPI,14,139,Screen died after only 3 months: Completely black. But Samsung fixed it free. Works now.,G.L.,4,Yes,04-Jun-17,7,2,"Now working fine. Downloads single web pages slowly as compared to my oher devices. Runs video perfectly though. So. let's say it is bad for reading the newspaper. But good for running, for example, CNN videos.
Here's what happened six months ago:

The tablet's screen totally died after about 3 months. Totally black. Wanted to like this tablet, but it's now a brick. Hoping Samsung will repair it or replace it. Was on-line with them, but they wanted serial numbers and such that I didn't have. Will try again. I repeat, a totally dead screen. They offered me no info on how to erase personal data if you have to exchange it, but I wiped it using Google's remote find feature. So be sure you enter a Google account if you buy this or any Android tablet.
When it was working, it sometimes had a slow response or non-response when you tap the screen. You have to keep tapping until it responds. I would suggest spending more money and getting their higher end tablet, otherwise it's just going to end up in your closet. I have a back-up S Pen Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, hoping it would have a better screen tap response. But it is similarly sluggish. I've been using my 5-year old Apple iPad Mini 3rd generation 95% of the time instead of these Samsung Galaxies because it's lighter and more enjoyable to use, and not slower. After blowing about $500 on two 10.1 Samsung tablets, I think I'm still going to have to buy a new Apple iPad. I regret saying this because I really was hoping Samsung had mastered tablet technology, but they're clearly a few steps behind; at least with these models."
B01EUC7NPI,14,140,Tablet Heaven,cassie,5,Yes,26-Dec-17,1,0,"I love this tablet; it is so functional. I needed this for work. This tablet was created for a person on a budget, but in need of a quality tablet. I was able to purchase the tablet, bluetooth key board case, and bluetooth mouse for under $300.00 dollars. Samsung and Amazon make duralbilty and affordablity accessable to everyone. This tablet was created for the mid-range market price point. It is designed for many fuctions like school and office use. The s pen enhances the tablets versitilty. If this describes your needs, then this is the tablet for you."
B01EUC7NPI,15,141,Great tablet. I prefer to do my computing on ...,ehn jay,5,Yes,14-Mar-18,1,0,"Great tablet. I prefer to do my computing on a desktop. In fact I hate laptops, but I spent a LOT of money on 2-1 devices for class when I was still in school... if only I had known about this tablet. It is GREAT for light work (office suite), websurfing, standard fare.

If you want/need to to video editing or any other activity that is processor intensive, go for a macbook or something, but if you're just taking notes, and surfing the web, this tablet + a bluetooth keyboard has you covered for 1/3 the price of premium laptops or 2-1's like the macbook or surface pro."
B01EUC7NPI,15,142,So far I love it. The battery is unbelievable,D.HICKS,5,Yes,03-Apr-17,2,0,"I bought the Samsung because I wanted to replace my pen and paper notebook. I got started with OneNote and set it up with OneDrive to share everything among my devices. So far I love it. The battery is unbelievable. I've seen the comments about the weight, but personally, I think the weight is perfectly acceptable considering how long the battery lasts. Everything works just like my Samsung phone. I moved several apps and setting and all my music using the Samsung Switch app. Had it less than a week, and bought one for my wife! I'll let you know if anything changes...one drawback...go ahead and buy a memory card."
B01EUC7NPI,15,143,LOVELOVELOVE,Maribel Bustamante,5,Yes,30-Nov-17,2,0,"I just received this 2 hours ago and I'm already in love...I had a Samsung tablet before, then decided to try the Amazon fire...that was a big mistake on my part...I had the Fire for 10 months and gave up on it...how could I think I would love anything but Samsung?? lol...the icing on the cake? I ordered it on Cyber Monday and got it for 177.00 ...excuse me while I do a happy dance!! :D"
B01EUC7NPI,15,144,So far so good,Rob,5,Yes,10-Oct-18,-,0,"I think this is a pretty good deal for a 10"" android tablet. The screen is nice resolution and bright. Has some good settings and adjustments for fonts as well. I bought this for my grandmother and she seems to like it. The only negative I can say for it so far is that the battery takes a long time to charge. Too long really.

I would recommend this to someone as a first tablet to test out and see if you like it without too much of an investment. But if you already know you want an Android tablet I would look at a different model that charges faster and supports a keyboard."
B01EUC7NPI,15,145,great little tablet for casual use,Alan,5,Yes,07-Aug-17,1,0,"great little tablet for casual use. It charges fast, performs flawlessly and has a moderate to long battery life.
I'm not a power user, i mostly read email, ebooks and watch movies/tv shows on this tablet. I use this tablet a couple of hours a day, and it has performed flawlessly for several weeks.
Also I installed a 64GB memory card when i got this tablet, because it's a little short on memory (but memory chips are cheap and easy to install ).
There is some crapwear pre installed, but i ignore it, and it doesn't bother me."
B01EUC7NPI,15,146,Great Tablet,Gary G. Russell,5,Yes,04-Jan-19,1,1,"This tablet was their leader in 2016 and Samsung has a policy to upgrade the OS for two years. So this one did upgrade to Android 8. Fast CPU and good graphics. Use it mainly to check email and play a few games. I purchased this one because I still wanted a 10.1"" screen. I just don't like the newer and smaller 9.6"" screens."
B01EUC7NPI,15,147,Better than iPad and way cheaper!,Jim,5,Yes,02-Jan-17,20,0,"These tablets are wonderful! I bought this for my wife, who used to love Apple products. This has a micro SD slot, so now she added a 128 GB card and has plenty of storage. The camera is great, and has a bright flash. Of course it does all the video apps and online streaming, Google apps, games, browsing. Not sure why anyone would spend double for less from Apple."
B01EUC7NPI,15,148,"It works, and they fixed it when it broke",SerenePDX,5,Yes,21-Aug-17,1,0,"You can spend more money and get an even sharper screen, etc., but this looks great and has snappy performance. Our unit quit functioning at month 11, but I'm keeping five stars because it was the best warranty experience I've ever had. I spoke with an actual person who took care of everything quickly. They provided a free shipping label, and we go the unit back in just a couple of weeks! They called aftewards to ask about our warrant experience.

If it breaks later and we can't get warranty, I will update this post."
B01EUC7NPI,15,149,"Large screen, great device for the price",Kim E.,5,Yes,09-Dec-18,-,0,"I have wanted a tablet for a while now, but did not see much reason to buy a smaller tablet that was barely bigger than my phone. My phone is an older Samsung Galaxy so I wanted to find a Galaxy tab since I was already familiar with the brand. This Tab A has a 10.1"" screen and it is so great! I bought a case separately and contemplated on buying a tablet keyboard but decided not to. I use the tablet mostly for browsing the web and I still have my laptop if I need to type documents. Got this at pre-Black Friday pricing and I feel it was a really good deal. Purchased a card separately in order to expand the space and have the ability to download more apps."
B01EUC7NPI,15,150,I bought this tablet on 11/2/2017. It arrived on ...,Gabe,1,Yes,21-Feb-18,3,1,"I bought this tablet on 11/2/2017. It arrived on time. It appeared to be new. It's been treated gently and kept in a shock proof case. It's never been dropped or exposed to anything beyond in-door conditions. It stopped working on 2/19/08.

I own a Samsung galaxy s7 phone that I've never had issues with. I'm not sure if this is a general issue with Samsung tab A or if I received a lemon.

This is a 5 star product if it doesn't suddenly die on you."
B01EUC7NPI,16,151,Good Purchase-Nice Tablet,Bob T,5,Yes,08-Feb-18,1,0,"As an Apple user I was a little hesitant to purchase this. It took me a little bit to get used to it, but after a month I'm glad I bought it. The screen is clear and it takes good pictures. There are loads of apps from the play store (most are ad heavy). The processor is quick enough and I purchased a 64 gb memory card so I could store extra books and pictures. The battery life seems pretty good. I only have to charge it once or twice a week."
B01EUC7NPI,16,152,Better than the Tab S3,BlueFlames,5,Yes,08-Apr-18,-,0,"I wanted to get a good tablet for school and at home I couldn't decide between the Tab S3 or Tab A with S pen. Tab s3 right now is on sale for around $450 not bad, but still steep for a tablet. I did my research the Tab s3 doesn't have a pen holder, battery life is not impressive to me, and while the Tab s3 is premium builded the tablet is all glass, yeah the tablet looks nice, but once you drop and break it then your going to pay the price for repairs and I didn't want to take any chances on that. I end up getting the Tab 10.1 S pen because more affordable price, long lasting battery life, S pen with holder in the tablet that's another plus, runs smooth, upgrade to nugget, and nice design love the big screen. I'm not saying Tab S3 isn't worth it because Tab S3 has a high preformance and a beautiful design, but lackluster batter life, no pen holder, glass, and expensive price wasn't worth it to me. I highly recomend the Tab A 10.1 S pen for anyone who looking for good tablet with soild performance without spending a fortune, this mid-range tablet is a definitive major go. I wrote this review on the tablet I love it so much."
B01EUC7NPI,16,153,I am in love with this tablet,Wyllow,5,Yes,18-Mar-18,1,0,"I am in love with this tablet! Fast, beautiful screen, long life battery. I can use it all day long, watching movies, TV, have all of my platforms available, photos, music, use Word, and not run down the battery. Recommend a rapid charger for this, or charge it overnight because it does take a while. A bit heavy if you have to hold it. Recommend a good, sturdy case for this, like the Unicorn Beetle Pro Series, which also has a clear front shield."
B01EUC7NPI,16,154,Real Samsung Galaxy Tab A,kkb,5,Yes,24-Aug-18,2,0,"Didn't know if this was going to be one of those 'too good to be true' purchases or not. But it is indeed a real Samsung product, with the S-pen & everything. Since I've had Samsung Galaxy Note phones back to the Note 4, I can't do without the s-pen!"
B01EUC7NPI,16,155,Awesome Samsung,"Roy Boyles, Jr.",5,Yes,06-Jan-19,1,0,"My mother in law who had just recently passed on had owed a Samsung 10.1 inch tablet although hers was a quite bit bigger in size which is what I was expecting in size but, all in all very well-made tablet by Samsung. I would most definitely order something like this again especially if it is manufactured by Samsung."
B01EUC7NPI,16,156,I have now had this for almost 4 months and am very pleased with this tablet,J. Barz,5,Yes,16-Feb-17,2,0,"Received this as a birthday gift. Previously had the 10.1 2014 Tablet which had a constant charging issue, even after replacing multiple parts. I have now had this for almost 4 months and am very pleased with this tablet. The changes from the above mentioned tablet are minor but obvious, it holds the charge longer, and it charges much quicker. Also, the 'plug' is on the side as opposed to the bottom, which makes so much sense. Love this tablet!"
B01EUC7NPI,16,157,"Update, Samsung is covering the repairs",Sharon Holland,1,Yes,19-Feb-19,1,0,"I only had this tablet for 3 months when it over heated and shut down and wouldn't come on again.
Now I understand that stuff happens. I don't like that Samsung made me pay $16.00 to ship it to
Them for repair! I also don't understand why they didn't know I paid for insurance to cover this tablet!
I want my $16.00 dollars paid back to me!!"
B01EUC7NPI,16,158,My first tablet,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,21-Aug-17,3,0,"Before you hate on me for stating I'm a MAC guy, realize I just think they are built better and faster etc. But when I priced the tablets there was no way I was spending that kind of money for something I didn't know if I would use. I did my research and came across reviews on this Samsung tab a. I have to tell you, from the packaging to the moment I powered it up, it has been nothing less than a delight. Fast, crisp, and the build quality is impressive. And to think I paid $500 less than I would have for an iPad. My computer universe is now diversified."
B01EUC7NPI,16,159,Loving it!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,01-Dec-18,-,0,"I've only had my tablet a couple of days, but so far I am loving it! I have an older 10.5"" Samsung tablet and it's just too slow anymore to keep up with everything I like to do. I got this for a ridiculously fabulous price on Cyber Monday so I couldn't pass it up. It's fast, the screen resolution is completely awesome - I'm totally impressed. One thing - I didn't receive a stylus (no mention of one in any of the materials, so I don't believe it was to be included) but what I already have works just fine. All in all, I'm very pleased."
B01EUC7NPI,16,160,Defective or inferior unit,Sue,1,Yes,29-Nov-18,-,0,"I have a same tablet I bought around last year. Everything is great, and I still love it. I decided to buy one for my mom, since her eyesight isnt as great anymore. But this 'new' unit has visibily dimmer display and bigger bezel. I suspect that this is either defective or samsung started building inferior version as value dropped. I dont want to risk having a defective unit since it might die in a year or have problems down the road. I'm going to purchase from best buy with geeksquad year protection although it's pricer becuase I dont want to risk it."
B01EUC7NPI,17,161,"... this a ""budget tablet"" because it works so much better, has so much more function",Loan Nguyen,5,Yes,09-Jan-18,2,0,"I have no idea why people call this a ""budget tablet"" because it works so much better, has so much more function, is so much easier to use than an overrated, expensive iPad. Make sure to buy a screen protector and a case! I would recommend this to ANYONE who is interested for a tablet."
B01EUC7NPI,17,162,Pass on the Fire HD,UbenSlayed,5,Yes,28-Oct-18,1,0,"Audio using onboard speakers would be the only downfall. Fast moving video suffers a bit of tearing. Raplaced my Fire 10HD with this as the Fire HD is not Firestick compatible, no Google Play so no way to watch in flight entertainment using GO-GO on most airlines. My new Samsung is perfect for flying,no issues."
B01EUC7NPI,17,163,Didn't last long..,Zack,2,Yes,21-Mar-18,2,1,"I have had this tablet for not even a month. When I could use it, it was very nice. The S pen worked flawlessly, the functionality was great. All of a sudden, one day it just would not turn on, egven when I charged it. I tried multiple charger cables, ports, and outlets. I also tried hard resetting it and nothing worked. I called Amazon support and they transferred me to Samsung tech support and were very kind and helpful so I could get it fixed or get a new one all together."
B01EUC7NPI,17,164,"Arrived brand new, never opened, perfect!",Joe F,5,Yes,10-Nov-18,1,0,"Was so pleased to have it arrive brand new! Perfect, untouched condition. So far so good. Was able to move 600 mb to sd card purchased seperately. Enjoy sound esp with ear buds. Video is great. Screen brilliant. S pen is amazing! Already updated to Andriod 7.0. Purchased great wireless Logitech keyboard, and protective case. I am so excited! Early Christmas present to myself!"
B01EUC7NPI,17,165,"Pre-installed apps, that i wont use, take up most of the tablet's memory!",KarlaP,3,Yes,26-Dec-16,11,1,"While this isn't the sellers fault, I can't even check my email, because pre-installed apps take up too much memory! I can turn them off, but that doesn't get me more memory. I've contacted Samsung, without much help. The tablet arrived promply & in great shape. If I can get these apps off & get some memory back, I will rate it higher."
B01EUC7NPI,17,166,I love this tablet as its got everything I need without ...,Ivan Diaz,5,Yes,05-Dec-17,1,0,I love this tablet as its got everything I need without being too expensive. The screen looks great and the size is perfect for those days that you want to just lay back and watch shows. I personally got this to use to take notes at school and I love that I can write notes with the S pen while it translates them into words with pin point accuracy. Some may see this as a budget tablet but it certainty isn't as it performs well and has been able to handle everything I throw at it. Overall I recommend this anyone who is interested in a tablet that can offer what the other guys do but a reasonable price.
B01EUC7NPI,17,167,Awesome Tablet,Dan,5,Yes,24-Nov-18,1,0,The best purchases I've made in a long time. The T580 does not have a pen. But you can buy one for about $20 compared to paying an extra $50 for the P580. If you're a Samsung Galaxy fan then you will love this. It's basically a large Samsung Galaxy cell phone without the phone capability. The price there's not much that can touch it for $157
B01EUC7NPI,17,168,Excellent Tablet for Office Work and Students,Romel,5,Yes,30-Apr-18,1,0,"I have always been wanting to purchase this tablet, and now that I own one, I can say that I am very satisfied. The included S Pen is very responsive when writing, which makes it easier to take notes instead of having a bulky keyboard case or reaching across the screen to type. The resolution and image/video qualiy is excellent when watching videos. As a student, I'd say that one of the best features included is Microsoft Word and Excel. The battery life between uses are pretty good if you're mainly using it for office work or taking notes, as it lasts about 3 days before I need to recharge it. Overall, excellent samsung tablet because it isn't too large, but just big enough to where it is still compact and portable."
B01EUC7NPI,17,169,Probably the finest tablet you can get for under $200.00.,Perry Williams,5,Yes,28-Nov-17,1,1,"Wow- Samsung hit the ball out of the park wit this one, and at this price. For the money, this is the tablet I want. I had compared this to the Tab E, which is actually more expensive, yet this one has better specs all the way around. You really have to watch what you read. This Tab has 2GB RAM. The Tab E is written on Amazon as having 16GB RAM, which is absurd (The Tab E -actually- has 1.5 GB RAM, and 16GB internal storage, two completely different things.

Anyway- for under 200 bucks, you're not going to find a better tablet than this one, for most purposes. A fine, solid, worthy piece of hardware."
B01EUC7NPI,17,170,Recommended tablet,Amazon Customer,4,Yes,26-Sep-17,1,0,"Very happy with this purchase. Battery life is great. It has been updated to the newest available level, Nougat and hopefully will also support Oreo in the near future. I was concerned about screen resolution as I was ""upgrading"" from a Samsung Note 10.1 2014 which pretty much has the best resolution for tablets, but is not produced anymore. Concern was unfounded as even though the Tab A does not support the same resolution as the Note 10.1 2014, it exceeds HD so photos still look excellent on this screen. I would definitely recommend this device."
B01EUC7NPI,18,171,I really like this tablet,Sadie,4,Yes,11-Jul-17,2,0,"I really like this tablet. I bought it so I would be able to watch something on a flight I was taking. I think the size is perfect and the picture is great. I wish it came with more memory, but there is a slot for a memory card. I also had an issue with the small magnetic strips coming out of the frame of the tablet, but not a huge deal. They stuck to my case and I was able to put them back into place."
B01EUC7NPI,18,172,Worked fine until mid-December when it began shutting itself off while ...,Larry1965,1,Yes,13-Feb-17,46,0,"Purchased this item in Oct 16. Worked fine until mid-December when it began shutting itself off while I was using it. It sometimes starts doing this when I've used it as little as 5 mins.; at other times after it's been in use 2 hrs.; or at any time interval between. Once it begins shutting down I restart it and it continues shutting itself off at 2 min. intervals thereafter. After contacting Samsung I was e-mailed a UPS shipping label and unit was sent to New Jersey for repair. Received the unit back, powered it up, and within a short time is self powered off. In short it had not been repaired and the problem as explained above remained. Again contacted Samsung and after some extended conversation my problem was elevated to a higher customer relations level. While in contact with them I provided a very specific, detailing of what was occurring with my unit and was assured the problem would be fixed if the unit was returned to the repair facility. I was again e-mailed a UPS shipping label and sent the unit back to New Jersey. Received the repaired unit back, powered it up, and after 15 mins. of use it self powered off and duplicate the problem mentioned above. Contacted Samsung once again and my problem was elevated to a higher customer relations level. At no time during this whole process have I received all kinds of, ""Oh, we're so sorry you're having this problem and that you are being inconvenienced"" apologies. Yet no one has the authority to do anything but offer ""return to the repair facility"" option to fix my problem. I asked what my options would be if I returned the unit the third time and it still doesn't operate properly and was told I could elevate it to another level. I am returning the unit today, but am not confident. My only suggestion is to avoid all this and don't even consider purchasing a Samsung product."
B01EUC7NPI,18,173,Great Android tablet!,TechTestimony,5,Yes,20-Mar-19,-,0,"I'm very happy with this tablet. The screen is bright and crisp. The battery lasts a very long time! With pretty extensive use, I only have to charge it every few days. The S pen is great for handwritten note taking and it works well with the integrated Samsung Notes app.

The tablet is very speedy and I've never seen it slow down. I'm always using the dual app functionality and never run into issues with performance."
B01EUC7NPI,18,174,Great look and feel. Doesn't really hold up under regular use.,jromeo78,3,Yes,08-Jan-19,-,0,"I've owned this case for 7 months.

This case feels and looks great. Seems soft but it actually provides a good bit of protection. I have dropped my tablet couple times and escaped any damage.
My only complaint is that the faux leather veneer is starting to delaminate in some areas. It seems to be mostly along the sides where I hold the case. If it had held up for a year I would have given at least 4 stars."
B01EUC7NPI,18,175,Excellent Features for the Price,tai133,5,Yes,06-Apr-17,10,2,"I bought this tablet to replace my Galaxy Tab 3 which was fine except for its horribly slow WiFi. No problem with this one. I connects to my 802.11ac network and offers very fast connections to web sites, video, news and other content. I also has very nice 1080p resolution and is generally a great buy at this price point. I spend more time on this device each day than on any other device I own."
B01EUC7NPI,18,176,Excellent Pen Detection.,Foomonchoo,5,Yes,22-Apr-19,-,0,"I bought this to practice drawing while on the go. The pen is pressure, tilt, and rotation detection is on a level comparable to mid range drawing tablets. Considering said tablets will often run you $400+ without a screen to draw on this thing is a huge bargain for any starting digital artist. Only downside is you'll be on Android drawing software, of which you have many good options but you'll eventually grow out of. Battery life is excellent and will easily last you an entire 24 hour day while running apps.
I do wish someone made a larger easier to hold pen compatible with device though."
B01EUC7NPI,18,177,I searched for a few weeks on the best drawing tablets that were affordable and was glad to ...,JK,5,Yes,21-Feb-18,-,0,"I searched for a few weeks on the best drawing tablets that were affordable and was glad to learn about this from a blog post. This is a hidden gem, as most people recommend the full size galaxy, which was out of my price range. The palm rejection technology is fantastic. So happy with our purchase. Battery life is great as well. I recommend this to anyone with a kid or just starting out on digital drawing(I'm not an artist, I'm a mom, so have no clue if this would be good for those who are more advanced at drawing)"
B01EUC7NPI,18,178,Great tablet,J. Tidwell,5,Yes,22-May-17,4,0,"This tablet is bright and fast. The battery lasts for about 3 days with moderate use. I really like the memory expansion to store pictures, videos and music."
B01EUC7NPI,18,179,Five Stars,Rudy Cardenas,1,Yes,25-Dec-16,4,0,Samsung galaxy tab A a terrible product I sent it back to Samsung 4 times in 3 months it took 6 months before Samsung would refund my money. This vendor was great but i sent his back after the first problem. I thought by purchasing it through Bestbuy I would be better off. WHAT A MISTAKE Best Buy told me to basically pound sand after 30 days if I failed to buy a extended warranty. Never again with Best Buy
B01EUC7NPI,18,180,Good for basic uses,Kat,4,Yes,30-Oct-18,1,0,"I've been using mine for a few months now. It writes and draws very well, but I will say storage is small and you can't do a whole lot if say you want to play games on it (I have 2 game apps on it and I make sure to exit out of the first game before starting up the second since it can get laggy if I dont). Good for basics uses, but not much more than that. It works for me though since I mostly just stream or doodle!"
B01EUC7NPI,19,181,Everything a mobile professional needs!,Sadia Matthews,5,Yes,11-Dec-18,-,0,"I was in the market for a new work tablet. Something lightweight because it'd be with me all day. Something with a large, clear screen so my clients could see paperwork more easily. And something relatively powerful so I could handle business on the go.
This Galaxy Tab A 10.1"" is everything I needed. The S-Pen makes signing paperwork and jotting down notes a breeze. My calendar (my life) was backed up in a matter of minutes so switching to this device didn't mean putting my business on hold. Worst part of this experience was when USPS initially delivered to my door instead of the apartment mailroom so my package was given to a neighbour. I was very upset considering I'd just invested in this brand new reasonably-priced tech, it's case, and a Bluetooth keyboard. But Amazon customer service dropped in and saved the day! It took a couple of calls to resolve everything but in the end I got everything I ordered. Highly recommend."
B01EUC7NPI,19,182,I think Samsung really made a great mid range tablet when they created this,Francis L.,4,Yes,20-Jan-17,14,2,"I've been using the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 S Pen (2016) for two weeks now. I think Samsung really made a great mid range tablet when they created this. The 16GB of memory is the minimum I would get for a tablet. Most of the time, I have about 40% free with all my apps loaded. The 3GB of ram is more than enough for whatever I can throw at it. Most of the time, I have 60% free. I recommend you have an app that can move apps to the SD card (I'm using a Sandisk Ultra 64GB microSD card). I frequently watch Netflix on it and the clarity is awesome, motion blur/ghosting does not exist. The S Pen's operation is smooth and sensitive enough for handwriting notes. The battery life is as advertised. I generally use it for 1-2 hour per night, surfing the web, watching short videos, browsing through Facebook on it and some light gaming (mostly Clash of Clans like games, not full screen first person shooters). The speakers are clear and loud enough to watch a movie on my lap, as well as for playing music in the kitchen. The build quality is impressive, it does not have any give when I try to bend the opposing corners at the same time. I highly recommend this!"
B01EUC7NPI,19,183,All my computing needs for a very low price,Linda C,5,Yes,13-Jan-17,3,0,"Great value for the price. I know that most people use tablets in addition to desktops or laptops, but this tablet is truly the only computer I need. I have free unlimited storage from Google as well as my own microchip archives, which I can easily transfer to a traditional computer should I ever want to."
B01EUC7NPI,19,184,Malfunction without cause,Sammi151,3,Yes,12-Sep-18,1,0,After two days of buying product the screen turned black but the device was on (you could hear sounds when pushing buttons) eventually the picture came back and stayed for almost 2 years when it happened again this time permanently. Tablet sent to Samsung for repair. Besides that issue it was a good tablet.
B01EUC7NPI,19,185,"LOVE IT! Very fast, long battery life, huge picture perfect screen.",Happy,5,Yes,31-Dec-18,-,0,"Amazing tablet. Its huge! We first tried ordering used off of ebay, description matching a galaxy tab A 10.1"". Instead we received the 8"" with undisclosed issues. Thankfully we got a refund and went with amazon! The 10.1"" is an amazing tablet, perfect size, ridiculously long battery life, great picture quality and sound. We use it primarily to stream movies and shows, its lightning fast compared to our kindles. 100% happy with this tablet and would recommend."
B01EUC7NPI,19,186,Simply the best!! Very happy!! Great to take notes!!,Aashutosh Taikar,5,Yes,23-Nov-17,1,0,"Awesome tablet!, I am an electrical engineering student and I must say that now I can flawlessly write all my notes in one place finally. The Spen is incredible, unlike other stylus you don't have to rely on powering the stylus. I tried purchasing other tablets as a cheaper alternative to this, but trust me all cheap ones are junk and useless. The cheap ones cannot simply be used as a tool to take notes, some of them won't even work with passive stylus. The palm rejection is awesome. So this is the best cheapest tablet if you are looking to take notes and if you cannot afford an ipad pro with apple pencil."
B01EUC7NPI,19,187,Great Buy,Robert L. Schauer,5,Yes,04-Jan-18,3,0,It really does seem to be true that you get what you pay for. I have usually purchased less expensive tablets and have had problems with them. This is working very well.
B01EUC7NPI,19,188,Great tablet so far!,Jordi,5,Yes,28-Aug-16,1,0,"Great tablet so far. This is my first non-Apple tablet....so far so good. I wish the screen was a little bigger but there again I'm used to an iPad. I worried initially about getting all my contacts and calendar events switched over to an Android device but linking everything to your Gmail account makes this pretty seamless across devices. I would highly recommend recommend ithis so far. If I had it to do over, I would have spent a little more for the 32 Gig storage model, although I haven't even used the external SD card storage as of yet so that will likely be a non-issue.
Hope this helps."
B01EUC7NPI,19,189,I DO NOT RECOMMEND,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,10-Apr-17,46,1,This product constantly shuts itself off and erases itself back to factory settings! Samsung support was absolutely a waste of time.
B01EUC7NPI,19,190,Good for Music,ksh,5,Yes,13-Dec-18,-,0,"I purchased this to display music when I rehearse and perform. I chose it because of it's high resolution display. Although I would have liked to have a slightly larger display, this has been working very well for me. I use an app designed for music to manage and display all of the files I have. The battery lasts a long time, more than enough to get me through a couple of rehearsals in one day! The display is bright, crisp and high contrast so the music is easy to read."
B01EUC7NPI,20,191,"Perfect for casual art, work and general use!",Alexandria Lillian,5,Yes,01-Mar-18,-,0,"Oh my gosh I am so in love with this tablet.
I like to draw, but I'm not anywhere near a professional level and couldn't justify spending a lot of money on a Wacom.
This is perfect for me. The stylus pen is so pressure sensitive and responds very well.
Easy to carry everywhere without having to dig through your bag. I work in IT and I have even started carrying it with me to remote into my computer while I'm out fixing issues. I was sick the other day and watched Netflix in bed on it.
Great!!"
B01EUC7NPI,20,192,Excellent tablet for the money,Bridgebeam,5,Yes,25-Jan-18,1,0,"The good news: my purchase included a 32GB micro SD card in the box and the tablet updated by itself to Android 7 when I turned it on. Neither of these were included in the description and were a welcomed surprise. The bad news: the tablet itself, and I knew this going in, has only 16GB of memory and at least half of that is taken up by the operating system. This is no fault of the seller but as cheap as memory is now there is no excuse for Samsung not putting at least 32GB in it. (My Samsung phone has 64GB!) So the micro SD card is an absolute must.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the tablet. It is well built,sturdy and the display is sharp and clear. It has operated with out any issues in the short time I have had it. This was a excellent purchase."
B01EUC7NPI,20,193,Everyday Tablet. Power on Small Budgets.,LoneWolffe,5,Yes,10-Jun-18,-,0,"I am really impressed with this tablet's capabilities. True, it's not the latest model, but that also puts it within my budget. The processor is fast, and I like that I can actually multitask without bogging down. The tablet feels good to the hand and the display is crisp and clear. The S Pen capability is exceptional, and I use it every day. Battery life is amazing. The included S Pen is spindly and short, which makes it uncomfortable to use, so I bought a stylus to use with it."
B01EUC7NPI,20,194,Perfect for handwritten notes,Kari,5,Yes,29-Jan-18,1,0,"This is an absolutely amazing device. I purchased the Tab A with S-pen to take handwritten notes without carrying around a million notebooks and this tablet has surpassed my expectations. I like to use OneNote, which was already loaded on the tablet, and it is an absolute dream to use. When the s-pen is detected, you can lay your hand on the tablet while writing and you can seamlessly scroll with your fingers then write with the pen. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone."
B01EUC7NPI,20,195,It's a hassle to keep together after 5 months.,CS-Punk,1,Yes,05-Jun-17,24,0,It freezes up when I highlight screenshots. I can't contact Samsung because they want my Samsung account info that I can't remember and they won't give me. It drops my Wi-Fi all the time too. These screenshots so are all it does now.
B01EUC7NPI,20,196,Perfect for College Note Taking,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,11-Dec-18,-,0,"I absolutely love this tablet. I use it for notes and studying for my undergrad and its perfect. I am able to download programs for note taking using the stylus to write and I am able to download my textbook and write on them using the PDF writer. The battery life is spectacular. The sound is very loud and clear, so great for when I need a break and want to watch Netflix. My only complaint is that the picture quality is a few years behind and that it takes awhile to charge. But the size is perfect, it's super convenient and I regret not getting one a few years ago when I started college. And it's also the fraction of the price of an iPad and can still perform the same tasks."
B01EUC7NPI,20,197,Great if you want a larger screen and can take the extra weight.,A Customer,4,Yes,27-Feb-17,3,0,"I liked the 10.1 inch model Tab A-faster than the older 8"", and has a more advanced operating system. However the extra weight and the extra size makes it less attractive for me, so I am sticking for now with the 8"""
B01EUC7NPI,20,198,Amazingly affordable and quality.,Kiona Wu,5,Yes,13-Sep-18,-,0,"I love my tablet. I mostly use it for reading on Kindle, videocalling my loved ones and playing my addicting restaurant games! However the only small peeve I have apart from the oddly placed speakers at the bottom, is that ever since getting it Google ads have stopped at nothing to fill my screen. I have taken to the official DAA site to opt out of as many ads as possible but 4 of them as of right now will not allow me to opt out. So as a result, every several minutes or so I get a loaded ad and it interrupts whatever I am doing. I don't know if there is something wrong with the tablet since getting it, but I can't figure it out and get the ads off. These do not pop up on my phone, and I literally have all the same apps and widgets etc on my tab. Nothing sketchy or different."
B01EUC7NPI,20,199,Solid mid-range level tablet for the money spent!,S. Sheyka,5,Yes,23-Dec-18,1,0,"I mostly use this for browsing videos on YouTube and mostly for drawing/sketching apps, thanks to the provided S Pen!
Not too shabby on RAM speed, depending on workloads.
More bang for the buck when it's on sale. A perfect iPad alternative, price wise, and if you use Android apps not found on the Apple Store. One added feature not found on iPads are the option to upgrade to a larger storage capacity with the use of a microSD card. 64 or 128 GB is a perfect upgrade for your tablet's needs. I highly recommend!"
B01EUC7NPI,20,200,Nice tablet for most needs,Tina,4,Yes,11-Aug-18,1,0,"Very adequate tablet for my needs. I broke my galaxy s3, it spoiled me re: display quality and extras. I really just need this for reading, social media and online business. This one works fine. If you're looking for top notch game and graphics, spend the money for a better model."
B01EUC7NPI,21,201,"""Dad, it's HUUUGE!""",Clay Leihy,5,Yes,15-Aug-18,1,0,I bought this for my teenage-artist daughter who is starting a graphic arts program at school this year. She absolutely loves it. The pen works great and the palm-rejection is awesome. Big and bright and sharp and fast. Right away it replaced the sketchbook she used to carry around.
B01EUC7NPI,21,202,Don't bother !!!,Cocoa Queen,2,Yes,17-Feb-18,2,0,"This purchase infuriates me for many reasons, but the crappiest reason of all is THE TOUCH SENSIITIVITY SUCKS!!! I have to click one thing like 10 times for it to register. Commpletely unacceptable."
B01EUC7NPI,21,203,Very Happy With It,BiblioAnnie,5,Yes,25-May-18,1,0,"What a difference from my old 7"" Galaxy tablet with KitKat! This one was well-priced and has Marshmallow. I caught it on a low-price day, and had a refund credit from another purchase to apply. It's so much faster than my old one. I'm getting used to the large size, in a good way. A very good value for the money."
B01EUC7NPI,21,204,"Very happy with performance, battery life, screen size",K. Stiegel,5,Yes,21-Apr-17,1,0,"I have been very pleased with this tablet so far. The screen size is marvelous, perfect for watching shows or reading books. The speaker quality is much better than my previous tablet's; I don't need to connect the external speakers I have to be able to hear it. The Samsung also has wonderful battery life; I took it out of the box, charged it, powered it on, and it lasted for four days on one charge (during that time I streamed about 10-15 hours' worth of TV shows, read about 15 hours on Amazon Kindle, and browsed the internet/other apps for 8-10 hours). I bought this tablet to replace my 3+ year-old Google Nexus 7 that was finally showing its age - the Samsung has definitely been a step up! I was a little disappointed to find it does not have a compatible Otterbox (although that's not Samsung's fault), so I purchased a Poetic Revolution product instead; so far it has done well. I highly recommend this for everyday tablet use!"
B01EUC7NPI,21,205,Who needs an iPad; save your money,Shamwow,5,Yes,23-Dec-17,2,0,"Purchased this for my mom who uses a droid phone so I figured getting a droid tablet would be best for her. I compared the spec and the pricing and the this tablet blew the iPad out of the water, this thing is so fast I'm so glad I bought this."
B01EUC7NPI,21,206,For use in tracking our new Ring security System,Dancy Girl,5,Yes,10-Jan-19,-,0,"The tablet is beautiful and has so many features that my old tablet doesn't have. We are not as technical as we would like and are having some problems setting up the security system. This is no fault of the tablet, but our inadequacy on how to set up the Ring system. We hope to get some help this weekend from a neighbor who is more proficient in this activity."
B01EUC7NPI,21,207,Works great cases are hard to find.,Kevin Masterson,5,Yes,18-Mar-19,1,0,"The tablet works great as I had an earlier version without the pin before.
The SPin is what makes it harder to find a case as the first one I got was for the regular model without the SPin.
So if you buy this make sure that the case says specifically that it is for the Tab A 10.1 WITH the SPin.
It will save you a lot of time and effort."
B01EUC7NPI,21,208,Chock full of bloatware/spyware!,Robert Johnson,1,Yes,02-Aug-18,4,0,"As a pad it is fine. It has a really good sharp picture on a BIG screen. It's very heavy and I assume that is the long battery life I wanted so no complaints there. I have given a one star though because I bought 16 gig of storage but it only has 7 gig free when you receive it! Yes, it that full of junky bloat ware THAT YOU CAN NOT UNINSTALL! So I only got half of the storage I paid for!

I have just one app I want to run on this pad, Garmin Pilot, it contains all the aviation charts, a geography database and all airport information right down to the price of gas on each airport for the entire United States. It needs 10 gig to store that massive amount of data. Samsung already has 9 gig of CRAP on the pad that you can’t uninstall (if you do it puts it back on the next update).

So I can’t install the only app I want that needs 10 gig on a 16 gig pad. I have that same app on my 16 gig phone no problem!

Then there is the whole spyware issue. Their apps want to track every move you make and sell it to the highest bidder (I assume.)
I would not mind them preloading the pad with lots of stuff but the part that infuriates me is that I can NOT uninstall it! I guess they think it is their pad ever after they take my money!

I will never buy a Samsung product again."
B01EUC7NPI,21,209,Screen touch sensitivity is lacking.,Austin reader,3,Yes,13-Nov-17,1,0,"I have had Samsung phones for a long time, so I'm pretty used to various Samsung Android platforms. There was no learning curve on this tablet, for me. That being said, even after I adjusted the screen sensitivity, my touch would not register on the glass without extra effort. I may get a screen cover and see if that helps, but I'm not in a hurry to spend more money, right now."
B01EUC7NPI,21,210,"Great product, great value.",sha,5,Yes,11-Feb-19,2,0,"Had an iPad before (I generally prefer Samsung, but ipad was a gift). The Samsung is at least as good, maybe better, aND way cheaper."
B01EUC7NPI,22,211,Good but low storage space,Kenneth M. Klein,4,Yes,22-Jan-18,1,0,"I like it but has very little storage space (!) -- I bought external memory card but applications can't be installed on it despite huge capacity (I think) so having to constantly uninstall apps to make space for new ones (at least large games etc.) -- didn't expect that to be an issue, maybe i'm doing someting wrong but OS takes up like 11 GB leaving only like 3-4GB for apps etc. ... wish i paid a little more and got more onboard storage i guess"
B01EUC7NPI,22,212,Great Product,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,28-Sep-17,2,0,"I love this tablet, it is divers and a good blend between a cell phone and a computer. You can download smartphone features and other Apps, you can write with a stylist, a keyboard or screen and the screen is large enough to allow me use in place of my laptop during travel."
B01EUC7NPI,22,213,I love my tablet,Robin Day,5,Yes,20-Oct-17,1,0,I love my tablet! This tablet has helped tremendously with school. I no longer have to lug around 3 different binders. The S pen has cut down on my paper waste by about 85%. It's also easy to share my notebooks via OneNote through multiple devices. The battery life is long lasting (about 3-4 days without charging and fairly frequent use). The camera has good quality as well. I do suggest getting the screen protector and Fenty case for it. FYI the fenty case comes with a Bluetooth keyboard if you're having to write papers or longer texts. I definitely don't use my laptop as much. Mainly for inputting pdfs or PowerPoint outlines in OneNote.
B01EUC7NPI,22,214,I'm much more pleased with this product than I originally anticipated,Shawn Powers,5,Yes,15-Mar-17,2,0,"This was my first tablet, but not my first experience with Android. I'm much more pleased with this product than I originally anticipated, and I've come to like the Android Operating System way better than Microsoft Windows. I'm extremely pleased with this product, and I very strongly recommend your buying this!"
B01EUC7NPI,22,215,Worth your $ for a tablet,Vivian Wong,5,Yes,22-Sep-18,1,0,"I bought this for school use to take notes and read online textbook. It is amazing. I use Onenote to take notes and this tablet comes with the pdf software that allows me to write on pdf files. The S pen is good, but I feel the S pen on my Samsung Note 8 is better, more sensitive and smoother. So far liking it a lot. Definitely recommend it for notes taking purpose."
B01EUC7NPI,22,216,Avoid Magnet accessories,Luis,5,Yes,22-Dec-18,2,0,"So far so good. I really like it. At first I was frustrated because there were some areas were the pen did not write, then I discovered it was because of the magnet case. So keep your tab away from any magnetic things or it will mess with your wiritng."
B01EUC7NPI,22,217,Controls difficult to see,Michael Bolton,4,Yes,29-Dec-18,-,0,"The three control buttons at the bottom front of the tablet are invisible at night and I have to shift the tablet to get light on them so I can see the one I want to use; these buttons really do need to be lighted. Also, I find the tablet camera screen quality to be lacking crisp clarity. The screen picture is not nearly as clear as on my Android LG G6 phone screen. The battery life seems very good, and it is left unplugged for days at a time and the battery holds it's charge. Overall my wife really like her Samsung Galaxy Tab A."
B01EUC7NPI,22,218,"Great for drawing, my unit slow charges only though",Eric,3,Yes,30-Mar-19,1,0,"I got this tablet for art, and it is wonderful for that so far! The only problem is that my tablet has never been able to fast charge, and the charging seems to be getting worse. I can't use it while it charges because it charges too slowly. After leaving it to charge for a few hours, I do get several hours of use out of it."
B01EUC7NPI,22,219,Worked perfect until the warranty get expired.,M.Andr.Jr,1,Yes,18-Dec-18,1,0,Amazingly or not... fews months after warranty expired I simply lost 200 bucks on a device that only worked for 15 months. Shame on you Samsung - these things should work at least for 5 years....
B01EUC7NPI,22,220,Love every bit of it,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,01-Aug-18,-,0,"Love every bit of it !
Mostly got this tab to replace my old old tab and to use s pen.

I use Lecture Notes and Handwriting Pro.

1. The fact that you can write something super fast when the screen is off is amazing. then you can change it later when you have time.
2. s pen works flawlessly. I will get something that is bigger since it is a tad smaller for my hands. Interaction between tab and pen is awesome.
3. Given I mostly got this for note writing, designing, writing and jotting down thoughts, the specification is perfect.

The tab is bit on the heavy side, but for the price I could not find anything better ! This is a perfect tool for me and something I am very happy to have gotten in less than $300."
B01EUC7NPI,23,221,Price was good. Got it cyber Monday,jen smith,2,Yes,18-Apr-18,3,0,"I purchased 2 of these for our daughters for Xmas. Price was good. Got it cyber Monday. But with in 8 weeks, the screen went black, then the other one had same problem one week later. Got them both fixed. One I’ve had them fixed twice, and now one isn’t working AGAIN."
B01EUC7NPI,23,222,A Good Tool...,David Allen Rivera,4,Yes,20-Oct-18,-,0,"A nice little tablet that is user-friendly. Good quality and durable. Gives you the ability to have computer access in a small package to operate independently of a desktop or a laptop. Though something a little bigger would be better, for the price-point, it is well worth it- and much better than a 7"" which I used to have. Having this gives you professional versatility."
B01EUC7NPI,23,223,This is 3 year old technology. Dont assume new.,Laura O Dunn,3,Yes,05-Apr-19,2,0,I did not see anywhere that I was buying a 3 year old tablet. I'm sure the technology has advanced and I thought this was more current.
B01EUC7NPI,23,224,"Great tablet, wireless keyboard works great with it.",SapphireMoon,4,Yes,02-Jan-18,1,0,"Still playing with it, but exactly what was described. Have Samsung phone so was able to quickly switch over all apps.

Update: tablet doesn't hold charge well. Daughter has very old iPad 2 and it holds charge for a week. This tablet is maybe a day. Also charges very slow. Would not recommend."
B01EUC7NPI,23,225,IMPORTANT: PEN QUALITY!,MichiganLove,5,Yes,17-Jan-18,1,0,"If you want the tablet with the Pen, buy this one. Don't buy the basic one then get the aftermarket pens, as they really suck. We ended up having to buy this one later on, then selling the original that didn't have the pen. The BF says the aftermarket pens are Expensive and CRAP, they don't last. So when I bought this one for him, he says the original factory pen that comes with it is Quality, reliable and lasts."
B01EUC7NPI,23,226,highly recommend for anyone who wants a new tablet,Nikki Bonds,5,Yes,02-May-17,2,0,This was a gift for my mother who sold her previous tablet to a friend. She uses this tablet to play games and read among all the other things she's able to do with it! She also loves that it's a Samsung product...highly recommend for anyone who wants a new tablet.
B01EUC7NPI,23,227,Okay product,Arlene Leilani,4,Yes,13-Dec-18,1,0,"So I really wanted this just for writing notes!
It’s actually quite a slow tablet. But that’s okay because the pen function is what I bought it for! The pen function is fast and smooth. A glitch here and there but nothing worth noting.
I will say, it’s pretty slow when browsing the web. That is quite dissapointing. Overall, the build is quite nice and good for light media tasks."
B01EUC7NPI,23,228,Another well-made Samsung product.,Father Noah,5,Yes,03-Sep-18,1,0,"This replaces a reconditioned Galaxy Tab 4. I prefer the landscape layout of the previous tab, but this is slightly larger, and I'll get used to the portrait view. Seems well maid, and will meet my needs for years to come, I hope."
B01EUC7NPI,23,229,Powers down,Gene,2,Yes,12-Feb-17,9,0,"The tablet is great...when it doesn't power down for no reason. Am returning for a replacement, hopefully it will not have this issue. 2/24/17--Update since I received replacement. Still had power down issues and locked up one time to where I had to wait till the battery ran down so it could reset. I have returned it and will do more research on comparable tablets, will not try these until issue has been addressed."
B01EUC7NPI,23,230,This tablet is overall easy to use,Andy,5,Yes,03-Oct-17,2,0,"This tablet is overall easy to use, the weight is reasonable and has a bigger screen than the current Samsung 9.7"" - more pleasant to the eyes for reading. The S-Pen works flawlessly however its a bit small and flimsy to hold, especially if you prefer holding something like a real pen, so an aftermarket stylus is recommended. The S pen still works like intended through a glass screen protector, don't bother buying the thin, soft one as it is for non-pen tablet only and will hinder the S Pen nib from moving freely."
B01EUC7NPI,24,231,A great tablet. I only gave mine away and got ...,aethelraed,5,Yes,09-Dec-17,1,0,"A great tablet. I only gave mine away and got the Tab S3 because I prefer a squarer shape. The tablet functioned flawlessly; I just like the 9.7 screen and 4:3 aspect ratio to the Tab S3 better. To me it makes a big difference in how I use the tablet. If I were watching lots of movies on it, though, I would probably prefer the 10.1"
B01EUC7NPI,24,232,"The size is great, the display is pretty decent too",E. R. Graham,4,Yes,06-Aug-18,-,0,"The size is great, the display is pretty decent too. The storage is pathetic. If I had a do-over, I wouldn't have purchased this specific variant of the tablet. For the price, I wasn't expecting a ton of performance and I didn't get anything to refute that assumption. Anything less than 32GB, for my needs, is too small - even if being used primarily with streaming content. Just my 2c."
B01EUC7NPI,24,233,Amazing Tablet with S pen,MiguelAngelCS,5,Yes,21-Mar-17,2,0,"Samsung Galaxy Tab A with S Pen, 16 GB Wifi Tablet 10.1 Inch (Black) SM-P580NZKAXAR
One of the best products!!!
--- A very good relation /Quality - Price/. ---
It arrived well packaged and protected with small airbags in the box.
Regarding it's specifications this Tablet fulfil up to the least detail, so I would say that it's as shown in the description.
The S Pen does its job!. Now it's time to use it as much as possible in order to see how it performs the first months.
I highly reccomend it 100%"
B01EUC7NPI,24,234,Nice tablet but heavy,Imashoein,3,Yes,16-Feb-18,1,0,I like the Android platform and the screen is just perfectly clear but the tablet is so darn heavy it actually hurts my wrists after using it for awhile. I tried changing the case but it does not help this is a hefty tablet. I do like it I just wish it wasn't so heavy.
B01EUC7NPI,24,235,Decent alternative to an iPad + Apple Pencil,Rose Arrowsmith DeCoux,4,Yes,07-Oct-18,-,0,"Works great. I bought this for trying out digital drawing, and the stylus works really well. A much cheaper option than an ipad with an Apple Pencil, though I do plan to switch over eventually.

My only complaint is that the power button is right next to the volume buttons, so I accidentally turn it off often if watching videos."
B01EUC7NPI,24,236,Awesome tablet for artist.,john mark rodriguez,5,Yes,25-Nov-17,5,0,Very good battery life for digital art on the go. Loving it :)
B01EUC7NPI,24,237,Amazon vendors suck!!!,K. H.,2,Yes,05-Mar-19,2,0,"I liked the tablet, but one of the two I purchased battery dead in a week. Sent it back and they refused to replace only refund. The second tablet dead a week later, and I had the battery replaced. Come to find out the batteries in them where the cheap Chinese batteries that catch fire all the time. Yeah OEM not!!!"
B01EUC7NPI,24,238,The Samsung Galaxy Tab A with S Pen is an excellent purchase,Earl,5,Yes,20-May-17,12,1,"I am very impressed with the Samsung Galaxy Tab A with S Pen. I have been using the Apple iPad for the last several years through my ex-employer. After leaving that company, I bought the Chuwi Hi10 Plus Windows 10 tablet based on the price and semi-decent reviews. After a few days of using the Chuwi, it had way too many glitches to be considered a working tablet. The Galaxy Tab A is equally impressive as the iPad, if not more so. The touch response is flawless, screen display is excellent, and the S Pen works great. I installed the OMOTON screen protector, and the S Pen still works great.

One of my huge gripes with Apple over the years is the fact that their products have no ability to expand storage. This Galaxy Tab A with S Pen has the capability to expand up to a 256 GB microsd card. I installed the Samsung 128 GB microsd Evo Select, and it works great so far. The other little perk regarding the Tab A with S Pen over the regular Tab A is the fact that the S Pen version comes with 3 GB's of RAM as opposed to 2 GB for the regular Tab A without the S Pen (yes, the S Pen version does cost more too).

Even though I really wanted a Windows 10 tablet, I simply cannot justify spending that kind of money to have Windows 10. Once again, I tried the Chuwi brand Windows 10, and I got exactly what I paid for. Being that Microsoft now offers most of its office apps for free (without editing of course),
there really is no need to own a Windows 10 tablet unless you do need the full capability of the Microsoft Office applications, etc. With the 128 GB microsd card now added, I was able to transfer all of my OneDrive data, and much more.

My only wish for the Galaxy Tab A is if it had more connection ports like hdmi, usb 3.0, etc. It only comes with one micro usb port...that is it. Having said all of that, I think the Galaxy Tab A with S Pen is an outstanding purchase."
B01EUC7NPI,24,239,Only 6 gb of usable space!!,Buster Thomas,1,Yes,15-Jun-18,3,0,16 gb but 10 gb is used by pre-installed programs! It's useless if you want to use apps.. Wonderful for pictures and videos because they can be used on the memory card..... Think twice before spending money on this tablet.....
B01EUC7NPI,24,240,Easy to Use Tablet,Larry A. Culmer,5,Yes,12-Dec-17,1,0,Great tablet. Easy to use in the same manner as any Samsung smart phone. Can be used for a week or more before needing to be recharged. bought a 128G sim card for additional storage. Sim card is a neat way to transfer files and pictures from the tablet to any of my computers.
B01EUC7NPI,25,241,Too small hdd,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,19-Feb-19,-,0,Works so-so. A bit sluggish. Do not buy if you intend to install more than a couple apps though! It only has 16 gig HDD and the operating system and memory take up a good third of it. Add some pics or videos and you're out of room quick. The SD card doesn't help much. I regret buying it and wish I had bought a brand with 32 gigs at least
B01EUC7NPI,25,242,The S Pen was a major factor in this purchase.,Dean Houle,4,Yes,11-Apr-18,-,0,"I cannot rate 5 stars, as I've only owned and used the Tab A for a month. I can say,
up until this time, I have not identified an area that would be considered negative. Remember,
it's a tablet, and closely resembles a Samsung phone, but so much more functional with
the 10 inch screen. And if I failed to mention, I definitely wanted the S Pen capability. I'm challenged
with a steep learning curve, but my desire to draw now has a powerful tool. Know what you are looking for,
and this could be the perfect match"
B01EUC7NPI,25,243,Good value tablet,joyful44,5,Yes,27-Nov-18,-,0,"Bought this tablet for light gaming and web surfing. Came with android 7.0. Added a 64gb Samsung SD card for any files, to save space, as this is only 16gb, and out of the box it's only about 9. I disabled the preloaded apps I'm not using and it makes a difference. Got it for lowest price I've seen. Fast, picture quality is excellent and the battery life is amazing. Good value."
B01EUC7NPI,25,244,Awesome Tablet!,Karen Harris,5,Yes,24-Apr-17,4,0,"I have been using the Tab A for a couple of weeks now and love it. It replaces my ipad mini and blows it away. Everything about is so much better than the ipad: screen resolution, battery life, speed, screen size, controls, flexibility (able to add micro SD), etc. I highly recommend it."
B01EUC7NPI,25,245,I simply use mine for video watching and streaming from services like Netflix and YouTube,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,02-Aug-17,-,0,"I'm not the type of person to download a hundred apps or to play games on my tablets. I don't even do work on them. I simply use mine for video watching and streaming from services like Netflix and YouTube. So my review is based on my experience with videos and video quality. The quality on the screen is amazing, and the Wi-Fi is able to keep up with my 1080p watching. Sound is a bit lack-luster, but I make up for it with a good pair of headphones. My only complaints are twofold: It's way too easy to hit the back or menu buttons on the bottom of the screen while holding the tablet and watching something, and two speakers on the tablet are both on the bottom. Considering I watch most of my videos with the tablet sideways, if I watch without headphones, most of the sound comes out the right or left side (depending on what side the tablet is turned to).

Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and will look at Samsung tablets in the future should I ever need another."
B01EUC7NPI,25,246,Like the tablet,janice399,4,Yes,28-Oct-17,-,0,The only other tablet I have had are Amazon HEX 9.8 inch fire. That fire was used daily until it blinked out and died. This samsung A 10.1 inch is replacing my dead fire tablet. It took a little getting used to the differences but this samsung is better at connecting to my printer and everything else I want it to do. My only complaint is the button on the bottom left of the tablet thats purpose is to cause layering on the screen. I hate that button.
B01EUC7NPI,25,247,Good entry Tablet,J W,4,Yes,27-Apr-19,-,0,"My daughters love this tablet and it is very user friendly. Very easy to use with kids. Battery life is excellent even with daily use. My wife has the same tablet and she loves it too. It might not have the technical prowess of other tablets, but it holds it own. I would definitely recommend to someone who doesn't care about having the latest/greatest"
B01EUC7NPI,25,248,The Best!,Mitchell Krauss,5,Yes,27-Mar-18,1,0,I love this thing. I take it with me wherever I go and it is always ready to go when I need to jot down my notes or surf the web. The built-in stylus gives it a major advantage over competing tablets. Pair it with the Samsung Book Cover and a Logitech Keys-To-Go keyboard and you have all you need for your daily computing needs.
B01EUC7NPI,25,249,Excellent product,MasterLink2014,5,Yes,29-Sep-17,1,0,"Tablet came as expected and while it does have some bloatware on it, it isn't too difficult to disable them so that you can free up some more space for other things. I would highly recommend getting a 128GB or 64GB SD card since this only comes with 16GB memory and that most likely won't be enough since the system needs at least a few GB to run on."
B01EUC7NPI,25,250,Another Great Samsung Product,W. W.,4,Yes,06-Dec-17,2,0,"I bought this to replace a glitchy Lenovo of the same size. I am very pleased that I did. The resolution is great, and it is fast. The battery lasts and lasts. I use it mainly for reading my morning newspaper, social media and email. I have only played with the S Pen so far, but, I want to figure it out."
B01EUC7NPI,26,251,Five Stars,Mo M.,5,Yes,27-Jun-17,3,0,I love this tablet! I'm in college and this gives me the opportunity to have written electronic notes.
B01EUC7NPI,26,252,My tablet works &I don't have to-plug it in everyday,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,01-May-19,-,0,I do not like today's style of living with all the electronic s I have been using them since 84 It will be Blessing to all mankind when the Power goes out. The using the tablets is fast for needed information but the lost of communication and real feelings from eyes smiles grins frown is lost.
B01EUC7NPI,26,253,Great,Shedwreck,4,Yes,20-Jun-17,1,0,Great tablet. Bought for the gf she likes playing games and her old ipad just didn't have the processing power to keep up. This runs her games without any problems or lag issues. Anyone looking for a quality tablet at a lower cost should definitely give Samsung a go they are one of my favorite Companies for electronics.
B01EUC7NPI,26,254,OUT OF MEMORY RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX,txfatherofseven,1,Yes,21-Jul-18,1,0,"I keep getting out of memory error messages. I dont have any media files on the tablet. Just apps. I even tried to move all my apps to my 64 gb SD card, but it didn't free anything up. Samsung support says this is a defective item and they are processing a replacement."
B01EUC7NPI,26,255,I'm liking it a lot!,Mike W,5,Yes,30-Mar-18,1,0,"So far, I'm enjoying using it. Have not experienced any of the problems I read about in reviews, and am experiencing all the good parts. Only a little diappointed that I can't download the software or user manual on the Samsung website."
B01EUC7NPI,26,256,Great tablet for browsing and watching videos,Dex,5,Yes,29-Oct-17,2,0,"Excellent tablet - I am writing this review from it. Great for browsing the web and watching videos, good battery life and pretty good processor. The pen is a pleasure to work with too. If you get it to write a lot (it comes with Word), I suggest purchasing a bluetooth keyboard. Sometimes when writing a lot the on screen keyboard misses a tap or two, but overall I am very pleased with the purchase."
B01EUC7NPI,26,257,Great Tablet!,Cubednewt02,5,Yes,12-Dec-17,1,0,"This is a very nice tablet that is easy to use right out of the box. It has all of the features I need without having the bloatware so many products have these days. The screen image is outstanding for pictures, movies and surfing the web. Memory is adequate for now.
This is a great value."
B01EUC7NPI,26,258,Died after 1 year - get extended warranty,Reviewgirl,2,Yes,08-Dec-18,-,0,"After a year my tablet died... It goes into a boot look of installing update and then to code, back and forth. I rarely used it. I contacted Samsung support and they will let me know what's wrong. It's out of warranty so I will have to pay for it. I could buy it again for $170... Hopefully repair is cheaper."
B01EUC7NPI,26,259,Pretty good.,relic1968,5,Yes,14-Nov-18,1,0,"Overall I like this tablet, however, I do not like that both speakers are on one end only. It's fine if wearing earbuds, but rather annoying if not."
B01EUC7NPI,26,260,"Beautiful Design, Handy and Comfurtable, Classy",Yalda,5,Yes,01-Sep-17,3,0,"Perfect product in this price. I am so happy to have it for studying class lecture notes, watching movies, doing my daily scheduling with more ease.
The only thing is that, you definitely need to buy a cover for this Tab as it seems too vulnerable to strocks or scratches."
B01EUC7NPI,27,261,Black Screen,Mike M,1,Yes,22-Jan-18,2,0,Bought this five months ago for my father. Now the screen has gone black and remains that way despite multiple reboots. I contacted the group on Amazon that sold it to me (GTR Group). They said they couldn't help me and that I needed to contact Amazon. I attempted to contact Amazon and they put me in touch with Samsung which was a futile endeavor.
B01EUC7NPI,27,262,Little bit of weight.,Dave Dollarhide,5,Yes,26-Nov-18,-,0,"After the initial setup of the tab. It's exactly like my Samgung Galaxy 8 cell phone. Except I cant call or text from it. Seems a little heavy, but then again Iam coming from a 7 inch tab to this 10 inch. So I will just need to get use to it. Otherwise, always been happy with Samsung products."
B01EUC7NPI,27,263,I LOVE THIS!!!!,tell the truth,5,Yes,01-Nov-17,2,0,"All I can say is I love this & so does my family!! The screen is large, the pen works great and no problems so far!! I am a Samsung lover by choice and this did not disappoint!!! 5 Plus Stars!!"
B01EUC7NPI,27,264,"If you're doing more than reading books, this is waaaay faster than the Kindle!!! Upgrade from that SILK",LizzieA,5,Yes,05-May-18,1,0,"I'm loving and learning... This is much faster than the Kindle 9 I was using to surf in my recliner... I bought a 32 card to be sure. As said, I'm still a novice on this, but very pleased so far and I think it was good for the price."
B01EUC7NPI,27,265,Screen light goes out fast,eric,1,Yes,04-Apr-19,2,0,"Screen stopped working on 1 after a year, the second 1 stopped after 2 years. Warranty is a joke, waste of money!"
B01EUC7NPI,27,266,Spend your money (here!) on a tab that will last you many years.,C. Evans,5,Yes,31-Jul-17,4,0,"Despite being a few years old now, this tablet could compete with any similarly sized on the market today. Specs are always increasing and some people obsess over tiny improvements, but unless you are trying to play a crazy resource heavy game that's due to be released in two years, this will probably do everything you need it to and more.

I used it as a glorified Kindle. I frequently play multiplayer online games on it with no noticeable lag. I thought I'd rather like a smaller screen for these tasks, but I'm very glad I chose 10 in. Especially for PDF reading and markup. So lightweight.

I wouldn't use it for all my computing needs, but I'm a heavy writer. I do teach (f2f and online) and have used screen cap/record to use the tablet as a digital whiteboard, making videos for my students. This was a godsend for the online courses.

I also love being able to take notes on it throughout my work day, at conferences. Forget all those wasted notebooks. Yeah, I love the pen on paper feel too. But this feels like ballpoint on paper (compare to the cruddy feel of the default MS surface tip or the iPad pencil). The pen is excellent and Samsung's current tech (the note 8 is meant to have an upgraded pen, but it's hard to imagine how they could improve it).

If you're new to Samsung and don't really like their TouchWiz launcher, I've found Evie and Nova Launcher work really quite well on this device. Probably won't see Android O through Samsung's support (currently runs up to N), but you can easily root and get O once it's released... or any custom mod you find at xda forums. Try to do that with an iPad!"
B01EUC7NPI,27,267,Very fast tablet.,Saiba Yoichiro,5,Yes,25-Feb-18,-,0,"Oh boy this tablet, I didnt think it was going to be this fast. Everything installs and loads quickly. I also got a 128gb samsung sd card for some extra storage and everything has been working great since day 1(been using it for a few months now).

Android Nougat(7.0) looks great, battery life is outstanding and display quality is top notch. I really hope this tablet gets the Oreo(8.0) update this year."
B01EUC7NPI,27,268,Another hit from Samsung!,TutorMaven,5,Yes,13-Feb-17,2,0,"Terrific tablet, great price. Very easy to set up and go, especially if you have another Samsung device. OTG capable-- using my wired mouse and keyboard and have a nice little workstation. Quick response, and lovely screen resolution. I definitely recommend!"
B01EUC7NPI,27,269,"No regrets with this device, very satisfied.",Jim Bob Oakley,5,Yes,23-Apr-17,18,0,"I wanted to upgrade my old Dell 7"" tablet that was no longer charging and the particular Android OS on it was buggy. I remembered Samsungs having a good display and slick appearance in general. There are lots of tablets out there to choose from and lots of reviews to read. I found almost all of these tablets have serious issues, even the name brands. I kept coming back to Samsung and trying to understand why I would pay more for this than most other brands while wondering if I was even going to use it enough to justify the purchase.

I'd tried a pen on my old Dell and it was neato but fairly useless. I got interested in this particular model because of the 10"" screen and the pen. The pen is very cool and I use it a lot. It interacts with the screen in an intelligent way that makes it easy to either handwrite or do scripting to text. The Samsung Note app is good and that's my main app for notetaking. There were some adjustments I had to make in the settings before it was doing exactly what I wanted, but after some time it is set the way it needs and works seamlessly to aid navigation and editing. You have to get this exact model if you want the pen!

Software is great, OS is stable, though some apps I use are unstable, but the device itself is solidly built and their implementation of Android has been reliable. I went to Play and was able to download most of my favorite apps on it. Because the device has the speed and the good specs, there aren't many delays in using it, other than logging into the security screen (required for corporate email, among other things). It either comes with or I downloaded Investing.com, which looks very slick and professional. Microsoft Office apps come standard. I think you have to log in with an account after a time, I used my corporate account and that has worked well so far. The drawing capability of One Note is superior to Samsung Note, but of course that wacky One Note filing system makes it weird. I prefer to put up with Samsung's app, with it's minor annoyances, but where I can see the note I just made as a small icon and easily navigate my notes. If you like a more sophisticated visual aspect to your notes, One Note lets you get very creative with color and style options you can select with the pen. You can do all the things you can do on a desktop version like insert images and so forth. And there are many background choices for a stationary type of look.

Haven't used the Word or Excel yet, but I've already logged in with my credentials so that will be seamless to use if needed. I took off or disabled what bloatware I could. Like a new PC, this thing takes an investment of time over the first few days to get rid of what you don't want and load what you do. I was pleasantly surprised to find the Google To Do app dowloadable and it works great on this device. It syncs to my gmail account tasks. So useful to have the Tasks separated out as a separate app again. My OBD II software for reading car computer data that was flawless on my phone would not hook up and work with this tablet. That's about the only software disappointment I've had. Everything else has worked as expected. I moved my old micro SD card from my old tablet to have my music collection available, no issues with that being recognized. Now, with about everything I want loaded, it's got enough space to run efficiently and download more apps if needed.

I've done a lot more with this device, trying to keep up with the other office geeks but not spend too much. I got it to recognize my corporate VPN and it was very straightforward, with an assist from our network guy telling me which protocol to use. Calendar app seemed to just take over on its own after I set up the email. It loaded all my work tasks and somehow grabbed my Google appointments, which I thought was slick and handy. Having got that far, I loaded ES Fileshare (?), which lets me remote into the corporate file system to view the same folders I'd see in Microsoft Explorer. It's slow to get going and loaded for viewing, but if I'm headed to a meeting where I'll use it, I can get it warmed up first and then no problem. Oh, and Microsoft has come out with a new RDP Client app in the Play store. I downloaded it and it works, I logged into my work PC with it and could operate almost everything there with my pen. I even ran SQL queries with it!

Recently, I found out about some decent piano teaching software, which I've always wanted. With a 3ft data cable (a USB printer cable) and an OTG (on the go) adapter, I got my digital piano hooked up to this tablet as a USB Keyboard Input. Downloaded the full version of Synthesia ($8) from Play and my keyboard can be used to interact with the software, which recognizes the mini USB input as a piano. This is the same port the charger goes in. The big screen is almost the size of a piece of sheet music, sits on my piano rest. I also put it on a standalone sheet music stand, the thick kind, and use it to run through songs using Guitar Tabs. Such an improvement over my old Dell in the screen brightness, size and response, so it becomes more usable for these hobbies.

But the main thing I'd use this for practically in a work meeting would be to VPN in and then use Chrome to view our web application, for which it works well, though again probably needs to be up and running before the meeting because that takes time. Secondly, I use the Notes app to jot down notes and action items. The ability to title these with the date and name I need is what makes all these notes accessible for the future. I can't do that with my scribbled notes in my paper notebook. I also can't erase my bad handwriting with ease and start the word over like I can with this stylus.

Best of all, the day I went to order this, Amazon dropped the price $50 bucks and then it was a no-brainer."
B01EUC7NPI,27,270,my fav tab ever,tiffany carter,5,Yes,03-Mar-19,1,0,I love this tablet. The only problem is the sound not as good as I thought a Samsung tab would be. Its the headphone jack.
B01EUC7NPI,28,271,Disappointed in the camera,Kindle Customer,4,Yes,03-Nov-18,-,0,"Apparently I know nothing about cameras. I thought the advertised 8Mp would be good for what I needed. I wanted a tablet that could take decent pictures for inspections and estimates I do at work. Pictures taken with this tablet are kind of garbage. I guess I will have to take pictures with my phone and send someway.
Everything else, so far, I like."
B01EUC7NPI,28,272,Best overall tablet,John,5,Yes,14-Feb-19,-,0,March 1st will be one year I had this tablet. Really good got android 8.1. When I got it I got 19 hours battery life on 30% brightness now I hit 17 hours so still pretty good. When I got it it did freeze about 9 times but the did is holding power and volume button then works good again. I would highly recommend this tablet cheap good screen looks pretty nice has good cases steal of a deal.
B01EUC7NPI,28,273,Love the screen size and clarity,LYNN W,5,Yes,04-May-17,3,0,"This was a big upgrade for me from my 5 yr old Galaxy tablet. Love the screen size and clarity, easy to use, much more vibrant color on screen."
B01EUC7NPI,28,274,6 month life span,Kellie H,1,Yes,11-Jun-18,1,0,"Well, it worked great for 6 months, and now it is a giant paperweight. I figured a tablet would make it a bit longer than 6 months, so that's disappointing. No trauma, water damage, it just quit working."
B01EUC7NPI,28,275,Love it love it love!,sewma,5,Yes,12-Apr-19,-,0,"I really didn't know which one to buy, but I'm glad I bought this one. The battery lasts for 2 days. It's a nice size, 10.1"". It's easy to use (I'm 64). My daughter helps if I need help. I felt comfortable using this after a couple of days. Would highly reccommend it."

I then bought a $99 tablet thinking it would be good enough for what I was using it for. Well, you get what you pay for. The cheap one went to H after about a month.

B01EUC7NPI,28,277,Loving this tablet,jlb,5,Yes,27-Jun-17,2,0,"This is my first tablet. Coming from a laptop with Vista, I am finding it is pretty easy to figure out, but still learning. So far it is much faster, and the Google search is fantastic."

Internet works quickly and reliably. This is my go to tablet always. I purchased one for my mother, who loves it's straight forward system, one for myself a while ago and just recently for my 14 year old son who plays games and does school work and reading on it. All of them have never given us one problem."

B01EUC7NPI,29,286,"Great Tablet ! Can't beat the price, comparable to IPAD Pro",hth999,5,Yes,28-Apr-17,5,0,"For the money this is an excellent tablet. I did some side by side tests with my Ipad pro, and the Pro is better, but not by much. Consider the cost, the Ipad Pro is probably double the price, but performance is close. I still give the edge to the Ipad pro, but not by much. If your looking to same some money, and buy a good tablet, this may work for you. My version only has 16 GB of internal storage, but that is enough for me. I did purchase a 64 GB Micro SD card for extra storage for movies, music, pics, etc. The Tablet has good screen resolution and appears to be well built. Do yourself a favor and buy a cover. Be careful when ordering a cover, make sure it will fit with the S Pen. If you buy the one without the S Pen the tablet is a little smaller, so make sure you get the right cover.....there are several good covers on Amazon for a good price. Hope this helps someone."
B01EUC7NPI,29,287,Samsung Tablets Rock,daniel PS,5,Yes,31-Oct-17,-,0,"This tablet is simply the highest quality piece for the money. It'll be current for years. I replaced one thats one of their originals. I was bummed it finally had to be replaced, but it just couldnt handle the most recent software. This baby more than makes up for it. My experience is they're bulletproof.
I watch movies on my flights and use it for email, etc."

B01EUC7NPI,30,292,WEAKER SOUND CARD THAN ADVERTISED,Michael M.,4,Yes,16-Feb-18,-,0,"With huge 200mg memory card overall performance is outstanding! Picture quality is really second to none in its class. Watching movies is a dream, and holds plenty for on the road trips, according to my wife. Would be 5* if sound card volume was as load as expected. (Good quality) Old smaller,cheaper tab A has louder sound. Why? Bluetooth to speakers shouldn't be necessary."
B01EUC7NPI,30,293,Mom loves it,rodisi,5,Yes,10-Apr-17,2,0,Got this for my mother. The pen is a nice perk for her. Every time I see her she's using her new tablet. It was easy to set up. Easy to use in general. I'm trying to talk myself out of getting one for myself.
B01EUC7NPI,30,294,Works well,MargeL,5,Yes,02-Oct-18,-,0,This is my third Samsung tablet and I really like the fact that using an app I can transfer everything from my old tablet to my new one. I got this one because I wanted a larger screen. I have traveled with it and the battery stood up without having to be constantly charged.
B01EUC7NPI,30,295,Ridiculously small amount of memory for this day and age.,Gravity Holdings,3,Yes,05-Mar-18,1,0,"The 16 gig of storage that comes with the tablet is nowhere near what one needs these days, especially since much of the 16 gig is used by preloaded apps and the OS. Ridiculous!

Screen is great, crisp and clear, hardware performance is smooth, he S Pen rocks."
B01EUC7NPI,30,296,Awesome Tablet,K. Leonard,5,Yes,19-Sep-17,1,0,My wife has been asking for a Tablet for a little while. I got her this one for our anniversary a month ago. She has used it just about every day since with no problems. She surfs the internet and watches a lot of videos with good performance and fast speeds. We have Samsung smart phones so learning the Tabs software was a breeze. So far this is has been a great product!

Sorry google/samsung i don't like bloatware or being told which apps i can and can't install. With all the best system maintenence apps i havn't had it on charge since Monday from 100% till now 37% battery life. The speed is great. Not had any problems with it (except when i tried to uninstall kaspersky av, but thats a story for another day). Worth the doe."
B01EUC7NPI,30,298,"Light, fast and useful.",Neda,5,Yes,03-Mar-19,1,0,I love it. Has been very usedul of course I wish I could spend more money and buy a higher internal storage but this one is still great.
B01EUC7NPI,30,299,Great tablet.,JAMES TOMPKINS,5,Yes,19-Nov-18,-,0,Tablet works great and has good durability. Needed something for use in the shop to be able to access project files without getting FOD into my laptop. When combining with hardened glass screen protector and a good case I have no doubts about using this in the shop or while camping and hiking
B01EUC7NPI,30,300,Much better,Josh,5,Yes,07-Jan-19,1,0,"Great tablet in this price range. Seems to have plenty of power. Glad I paid a bit for for this than the Fire 10, and glad I did not shell out more for the expensive one. Just used for browsing, videos and music. Rated picture 4 because for some reason a few apps will only load 720p video which was not an issue I had with the Fire."
B01EUC7NPI,31,301,Great tablet,Jason Osteen,5,Yes,19-Jun-17,3,0,This thing has been great. Nice upgrade from the 2014 10.1 tab pro
B01EUC7NPI,31,302,Great for visual impairment,MT96,5,Yes,02-Sep-18,-,0,My husband has many vision problems and this tablet pretty much solve them all for now. Since we are already Android users it makes way more sense to buy a tablet than an iPad. I immediately installed an app called Nova which helped tremendously on even more visual choices.
B01EUC7NPI,31,303,Comes with outdated software and bloatware.,Andrew Croft,1,Yes,19-May-18,4,1,"I like the portability and SD CARD storage. That's it. I'm a Samsung fan, but this thing sucks. The small 16GB built in storage is half gone already with crap apps no one wants and you can't get rid of them. Downloaded a few small apps and in no time the memory is full. Warnings that I've used all my memory and must uninstall apps comes up. So I delete all of the apps etc that I installed. Still get the memory full warning. 15.55GB of 16GB used. Even though I've deleted EVERYTHING! The display is also NOT what they claim, it's over bright and unnatural, colors are weak and dull.
Most apps that run perfectly on a cheap smartphone don't even work on this device, and as far as all the things they claim you can do on this thing, the memory issue prevents you from doing ANY OF IT! Mine is up for sale for $150. It's been in a case the whole time and is in perfect like new condition with original packaging.
If anyone wants it. But I don't recommend it."
B01EUC7NPI,31,304,S Pen not working :(,Faye Chien,3,Yes,28-Aug-18,2,0,"Works great except S Pen doesn't work... shame because I got it specifically to draw with the S Pen.
I do freelance art and wanted to try drawing on the screen. Still a good device tho."
B01EUC7NPI,31,305,Works with all the apps I needed.,LT,5,Yes,09-Apr-19,-,0,"I wanted to use the table to do my gym classes, try the Apple..didn't work, try a older version of Galaxy..didn't work either :(
I order this tab A SM-580 and magic happened I was able to download all the apps that I needed for my workout and everything else, good quality picture and volume, I really, really recommended if you need a tab that is going to the job without spending a fortune, get this tab."
B01EUC7NPI,31,306,Finally able to afford one and it was worth it!,Mosquito,5,Yes,14-Dec-17,1,0,"Use these everyday. Somehow I ended up inadvertently ordering two, but I guess it was meant to be because my husband and I use them regularly. My 4 year old granddaughter likes to play on mine, keeps her occupied while I'm busy doing other things."
B01EUC7NPI,31,307,Screen needs repeated touches to perform,5string,4,Yes,20-May-18,-,0,"Samsung's fault. This screen requires multiple touches to actually get a result. Sometimes the icon will react but fail to follow through requiring repeated touches. Samsung needs to do way better job making security and software updates available for their products.
I use this a lot because I don't like small screens."
B01EUC7NPI,31,308,My husband is an android user and I love Apple products,Ronnie,5,Yes,24-Jan-18,1,0,This is a very large tablet for a small price. My husband is an android user and I love Apple products. He may have bought this to win my away from Apple : ) I am learning to use it and his strategy may be working!
B01EUC7NPI,31,309,Great affordable upgrade to my ereader.,Rikki,5,Yes,30-Dec-17,1,0,"My son bought me this tablet to replace my 4 year old nook hd. I love it, can put all my books from several platforms back on it with the aps, browse, read email, play with my photos, play little games. It's perfect."
B01EUC7NPI,31,310,Have a couple of issues. One the touch screen ...,Amazon Customer,4,Yes,08-Feb-18,2,0,"Have a couple of issues. One the touch screen doesn't always work first time, sometimes I've tapped it up to 6 times. Second issue recently it has actually just blanked out for no reason and one time took several tries at off and on to get it to respond.
Must say I am concerned.&#55357;&#56853;&#55357;&#56852;"
B01EUC7NPI,32,311,I like my tablet,Christopher Cannon,5,Yes,27-Jun-17,3,0,"I like my tablet. I'm a college student and it allows me the convenience of doing homework on the go. It also supports MS Word, Excel and Powerpoint."
B01EUC7NPI,32,312,The tablet itself is great but the S pen stopped working within a month,Hillary Stapf,3,Yes,14-Jun-17,2,1,The tablet itself is great but the S pen stopped working within a month. Problem is Samsung is being very difficult with sending a new - replacement pen. I have called twice. Both times they initially tell me to mail the pen back. Then after about 45 minutes of being on hold they say I do not need to return the pen and then will mail me a replacement. Still no pen!!!! Samsung customer service is horrible!!!!
B01EUC7NPI,32,313,Great for entire family,Michelle Mills,4,Yes,12-Dec-17,1,0,"We've had this tablet for a year now. Still works the same as the day we got it. I use it everyday, but I wouldn't say it's ""heavy use."" Having had a Samsung note phone, I was dead set on getting a tablet with a pen and I'm glad that I have the option to use it! I love that the Samsung app store had a kids mode app! I can set the time limit on how long the kids can play and I feel confident their is nothing detrimental they can do to mess up the tablet."
B01EUC7NPI,32,314,GREAT PRODUCT from a GREAT SUPPLIER,Richard Dietrich,5,Yes,10-Dec-18,1,0,"This is 2nd Samsung tablet. It's a replacement for an elderly and much loved
Samsung Note tablet."
B01EUC7NPI,32,315,A must get for class,LeeIB,5,Yes,28-May-17,4,0,"One of my best investment on a tablet. The whole reason for this was because of the s pen. It doesn't write like the surface pro, but the fact that it already has a ""writeonPDF"" app is awesome! All my physics lectures were on a pdf file, but on my surface I couldn't write anything on it unless i bought its subscription... however, the tablet allowed me to write on it through the app that was already preinstalled. Best app ever. Of course there are few other tablets out there with pen capabilities, but this is the only one that can conveniently go with you discretely everywhere without having to carry it on you.

For OneNote note taking, I prefer the surface pro for the bigger screen and more pen like feeling. For pdf's, I use the tablet. I also use the tablet for writing codes. The surface is too big to have in front of me when I'm writing a program on my computer, but the tablet is just small enough where I can write out my codes first and save it for future reference (instead of using paper and having to carry that around)."
B01EUC7NPI,32,316,Ace tablet,Mr. Charles Hodencq,5,Yes,05-Dec-17,1,0,"Have had the tablet for just over a week now and so for I've been very impressed. Finding new ways of using it and I really really like the S-pen. Yes it is than is heavier the average bear but heck, that battery lasts so much longer than others I've experienced. I'm not a big gamer but for watching videos, basic social media & e-mail it holds its own. The Google text recognition is really quite impressive.

Now to see how it fares with work related tasks. Simple drawings, notetaking and hopefully puting together quotes."
B01EUC7NPI,32,317,Good budget tablet,Sean Fendt,4,Yes,25-Jan-18,1,0,"Its a decent tablet, definitely for the price. Not a lot of storage, and I really hate the way new droid versions prevent you from simply using a good old flat file system on the SD card, but its useful, light, and has the features I need. Bluetooth, GPS, etc. Nice size, bright display."
B01EUC7NPI,32,318,Great little tablet,mike riley,5,Yes,16-Jan-17,1,0,Great little tablet for my work and play. It's much larger than I thought it would be. Works nicely and I can open just about any kind of document.(I downloaded some apps for this).....It hooks right up to Windows 7 and shows up in Windows Explorer with no problem. Can transfer documents to it easily. The case I bought was a must. This tablet could get broken without it. Really like it.
B01EUC7NPI,32,319,Great product for the money,mike levin,5,Yes,04-May-17,4,0,"Great product for the money, purchased ~ 4/17. For a few hundred dollars more, having the 'latest and greatest' tablets simply is not needed."
B01EUC7NPI,32,320,Great Delivery,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,17-Mar-19,1,0,love my new tablet. Came on my birthday! seller was prompt and it was packaged very well. Thanks soooo much. very satisfied.
B01EUC7NPI,33,321,Better than the cheap Tablets by far.,A. W Yaney,5,Yes,29-Sep-17,1,0,"Works great let me use a huge Mini SD card so I can store Amazon and Vudu movies on it and a few games.
If you are thinking of a 10 inch Tablet do NOT go cheaper than this one.
I did and regret it. Now I have this one."
B01EUC7NPI,33,322,Play Store won’t open,Fnukn Lnukn,1,Yes,20-Apr-19,-,0,"Play Store app won’t open, error code DF DFERH 01, “Error retrieving info from server”.
Unsuccessful working with three Google Support Team members. Confirmed password app ""Last Pass"" not compatible. Returned for refund"
B01EUC7NPI,33,323,Great product!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,17-Jan-17,2,0,"Very happy. Much better than my old Galaxy 10. Bright screen, great color, super battery life and quick charge. Can't think of any way it could be better. The price swings widely on this product. I suggest you view the websites which monitor price."
B01EUC7NPI,33,324,"Slow internet, slow everything",Itay E.,2,Yes,25-Mar-19,1,0,"No bad screen, ok pen, would be OK for 2015. Very slow for 2019. can't return, sad."
B01EUC7NPI,33,325,Maybe too old a model.,BMXmike78,1,Yes,22-Oct-18,-,0,"I don't know If mine was defective, but it rarely connected to my D-link whole home router or the wi-fi range extender. All of my other electronics connect at a hi speed. Also apps kept closing and the tablet kept shutting off. I don't think ill buy samsung again."
B01EUC7NPI,33,326,Returned,Ben,3,Yes,27-Feb-19,1,0,"Had to return it becoz the tablet ran like a 10 years old tablet. The s pen doesnt work too well, is not great for drawing."
B01EUC7NPI,33,327,I like very much this TAB,joefox,5,Yes,23-Nov-16,3,0,"I like very much this TAB, feels very solid. Got on excelent price. Very snappy and fluid. Camera it's good for a tablet. Battery life excellent. Screen it's gorgeous. Like a lot"
B01EUC7NPI,33,328,Almost flawless note taking tablet. Only complaint is that ...,Paul,5,Yes,10-Feb-18,-,0,"Almost flawless note taking tablet. Only complaint is that there is not yet (?) a android 7.1+ upgrade released, which unlocks many more features with Microsoft Onenote, so you are stuck with a more basic version of Onenote for the moment. But that is not a deal breaker, given the price/quality."
B01EUC7NPI,33,329,It's a good tablet. It's not the most powerful one around ...,Jose Pena,4,Yes,18-Dec-17,1,0,"It's a good tablet. It's not the most powerful one around the neighborhood, but it does its job very well. It comes with a 1.6 GHz exynos 7870 octa-core Processor, 2GB of RAM + 16GB and it is equipped with a micro SD slot that supports up to 2TB. Recommended so far."
B01EUC7NPI,33,330,Battery is great so far,issie,4,Yes,09-Dec-16,1,0,"My first tablet. Battery is great so far, less than 20% 5 or 6 hrs. I bought it for internet cruising so I didn't put in a password. I am guessing that because I logged on my home internet (the only way it will work) is why the next morning It had a password prompt. After trying my computer password and 2 laptop passwords I found it had my windows phone password installed. Tec companies = the new big brother = nosy neighbor. FYI, I NEVER buy anything that is advertised on any page."
B01EUC7NPI,34,331,Husband loved it,Boater girl,5,Yes,13-Nov-18,1,0,Great tablet. Easy to use. Beautiful display. Long battery life. We are always happy with Samsung electronics.
B01EUC7NPI,34,332,I got it for a great price and it's a great 10 inch tablet.,A. R. Kauth,5,Yes,31-Oct-17,-,0,"I got this as a gift and it works well. Great actually. The only thing I would change is that I wish it had more onboard memory. But for whom I bought it for, they love it. I use it all the time too as well.

I bought it as an alternative to the really expensive versions and I couldn't tell the difference. The quality of this is high."
B01EUC7NPI,34,333,Great tablet except for occasionally glitching. Do restart.,The Bells,4,Yes,23-May-18,-,0,"Wonderful tablet at an affordable price! Great replacement. It's longer and skinnier than with had before but I'll get used to it.

*** update **** im having glitching and freezing issues with this tablet. But it seems to have cleared itself up after awhile."
B01EUC7NPI,34,334,Nice !!!,tgtech,5,Yes,15-Feb-18,1,0,"A little dated, but works fantastic. I like that performance has improved so much over time that spending a little less on a slightly dated unit still results in a great unit. Great quality!"
B01EUC7NPI,34,335,Don't buy anything less than 32 GB device memory,Kevin,2,Yes,08-Feb-19,-,0,"Not worth it. 16 GB is simply not enough device memory. Forget about adding the memory card. There are too many everyday apps that require device memory for installation. Once you load up apps you are out of device memory. I have a 128 GB memory card that I have barely used because most of the apps I want require device memory. In addition, video is not HD quality, nor is sound. Also, you'll regret not having cellular capability. Save your money and buy a better device with all the top features."
B01EUC7NPI,34,336,Not new..,carmen,3,Yes,14-Jul-18,-,0,"I bought this as new but it was not new when i got it, i could tell that it was use no plastic wrapping on it nothing, no charger neither the box was not seal, its been working pretty good but for the price i could of had gotten a new one with charger..i keap it, hate returning thing."
B01EUC7NPI,34,337,Works great,Jenni Ludtke,5,Yes,09-Jan-19,1,0,"Im still using it 2 years later, and it's still fast and runs perfectly"
B01EUC7NPI,34,338,Just get one.,nioGara8,5,Yes,11-Dec-18,-,0,Works great. I’m used to Apple products so now I just have to teach myself how to use Android products. So far so good. Everything is working great. Battery life looks good. I’m getting 8 to 9 hours of battery life because I’ve mainly got it to watch my favorite show and playing a little game here and there.
B01EUC7NPI,34,339,Very good Tablet,Adrian L. Mike,5,Yes,04-Dec-16,1,0,"Very happy with the Tab A, I had the original Galaxy Tab and this I can see the improvements. No regrets buying it again. Pictures, movies open up very quickly, the screen is very crisp and clear. Applications run without any issue, connect to WiFi networks without any problems. All in all, a good tablet, and the price was very good."
B01EUC7NPI,34,340,I have two of them and...,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,11-Aug-18,-,0,"I can't say enough about this Tab with s pen, it is with me all the time. Through One Note onto this Tab and it will become the best note taker you can imagine. Then though on Sketchbook (and any other creative tool you can think of) and it will become an extention your imagination. Great price for a powerful tool. Wish it had more storage but... embrace the cloud and you will love this tablet."
B01EUC7NPI,35,341,Great tablet for price,South American Jungle Primed Enthusiast,5,Yes,06-Mar-17,1,0,"Yep, the only complaint is the speaker placement and can't quite figure out why 15G of internal memory was taken up so fast with a 200G SD card installed, moved everything I could to card, still have trouble downloading new apps and updates. Battery lasts for days."
B01EUC7NPI,35,342,Great,Jordan,5,Yes,18-Aug-16,8,0,"Runs great, looks great, screen is great, boots super quick and the battery is very good. The stock launcher is kinda rubbish so I recommend replacing it (I'm using Nova launcher at the moment) and comes pre-installed with a little bit of bloatware (some CNN app and the Microsoft Office suite). The only complaint I have is that the rear facing camera is not flush with the body so it doesn't lay perfectly flat against a surface."
B01EUC7NPI,35,343,Everything is good but it has one small defect.,Tommy,4,Yes,02-Jan-19,-,0,"So far, the experience has been decent.
You get what you pay for and I think this tablet is better than Amazon Fire because this has a regular Android OS, unlike the one on Fire tablet which is really restricted version of Android.

And my unit is shipped with a small flaw.
The back light in the lower left corner of the screen is always on unless you turn the screen off (see picture). But this doesn't bother me as much.

All and all, I recommend this one over Amazon Fire, and hopefully yours will be shipped without a defect."
B01EUC7NPI,35,344,Nice budget tablet,john bright,4,Yes,01-Feb-19,-,0,"Very good screen as expected for a Samsung tablet, good battery life, processor streams most media well, happy with purchase, not a good choice for processor intensive apps, games or streaming 4K content."
B01EUC7NPI,35,345,I liked this tablet so much that I bought a second one,Gomez,5,Yes,08-Apr-18,-,0,I liked this tablet so much that I bought a second one. I now have one at work and one at home. A quality android tablet at a reasonable price. The screen is neither too big nor too small. It is not heavy so you can hold it up and use it like a paperback book without fatiguing your hand or wrist.
B01EUC7NPI,35,346,"Great Tablet, great service",Kindle Customer,5,Yes,20-Jan-17,2,1,"Initially believed the tablet was defective, but it turned out that the problem lay with our failure to follow instructions! The tablet actually works fine and the third part seller, Electronic Express, was more than helpful in helping us solve our issue."
B01EUC7NPI,35,347,Abuela Approved,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,07-Nov-17,2,0,"Bought this for my abuela for her birthday. She loves it so much. It's easy for her to navigate and keep in touch with all our family. She was unsure about the S Pen at first, but she is so glad for the slot for it, since she tends to accidentally lose her stylus. It even lets her take high definition pictures (She thought this was amazing!). Thank you Amazon!"
B01EUC7NPI,35,348,so good. Loaded everything that my phone has onto the ...,Jennifer,4,Yes,09-Dec-16,2,0,"So far, so good. Loaded everything that my phone has onto the tablet and works really well. Battery life is excellent, typical android apps for education available. Excellent black friday deal."
B01EUC7NPI,35,349,... draw and sketch on in Medibang Paint and its amazing. Smooth drawing,Ventain,5,Yes,30-Jul-17,1,0,"I bought this tablet primarily as a device to draw and sketch on in Medibang Paint and its amazing. Smooth drawing, great tracking and pressure sensitive. Its wonderful and fast and the memory is upgradable. Love this purchase."
B01EUC7NPI,35,350,Love samsung products,Mommy.Shopper,5,Yes,06-Mar-18,-,0,"So far so good! We love samsung brand. It's easy to set up, logging onto your existing accounts to transfer your info into the new devise. It's set up like my phone and kind of like a kindle. My son's old samsung ran out of memory so this is an upgrade. I purchased a large sd card for this. Hope it lasts."
B01EUC7NPI,36,351,Shoulda bought this sooner!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,18-Aug-17,1,0,"I Love this tablet! I had an Apple 2 Ipad, and became frustrated with it and decided to try this - so glad I did! No problems with keeping my WiFi connection while searching websites or just being on the tablet for a long period of time (my biggest Ipad complaints), good clarity, and since I have a desktop PC, it will be easier to access & use documents."
B01EUC7NPI,36,352,Great tool.,Txagengr,5,Yes,20-Jun-18,-,0,"Fast shipping. Tablet is being used in the field on a construction site. So far, it's been a great tool. A little concerned about the durability, but will see how it holds up. Stylus is very handy and useful for recording field comments on electronic drawings, and is a nice addition to the camera."
B01EUC7NPI,36,353,Black screen within 6 months,David,2,Yes,09-Jul-18,-,0,"Screen went blank within the first 6 months. Tried all the tips and tricks online but no luck. Finally got to the point where I decided to open and check cabling. Turns out the LCD screen wiring was loose and created blury picture even after reconnecting, thus a faulty cable."
B01EUC7NPI,36,354,You Get What You Pay For,Drew M.,3,Yes,04-Jun-17,11,1,"The phrase goes, ""You get what you pay for."" This was the next best thing to an Apple iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil, and it was several hundred dollars less. So, I got it.

It's a nice device. Substantially less nice than an iPad, but for the price, it is very appropriate. I was familiar with Android devices after having a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ for two years, and the OS works very similarly on this tablet. Battery life is pretty good, as long as you don't use bluetooth. It's fast, it doesn't freeze.

However........contrary to all of the raving reviews, the S Pen DOES NOT work well. I got this device specifically so that I could mark up pdfs. Well, the primary problem is you can't rest your hand on the screen. The tablet can't tell the difference between your hand and the pen. (With the iPad Pro, however, you can.) Secondly, this makes it very difficult to write on. My handwriting comes out very sloppy.

To test whether it was user error, I went to an Apple store and tried to write on an iPad. Completely, utterly, different. I could write just like I was writing on paper. Very efficacious. So, in this regard, the Galaxy Tab with S Pen is not an inexpensive alternative to the iPad Pro. It's not even in the same league.

Otherwise, the device works well. Just not for what I primarily bought it for. Bottom line: you get what you pay for"
B01EUC7NPI,36,355,Worth purchasing,LAW,5,Yes,25-Jan-18,1,0,"Love this!! I have a no name brand one that is great but the touch screen isnt so good, this Samsung Tab A is just super with a touch screen that is responsive. Fast and well worth purchasing."
B01EUC7NPI,36,356,This tablet is an excellent buy. Great graphics and ease of navigation.,Yarburger,5,Yes,24-Oct-17,-,0,"Absolutely a great buy. Great graphics; great color; very quick in acquiring wifi. Battery appears to be very strong. The tablet is just excellent all the way around.
Easy to navigate through apps and through settings. Easy to change your settings as well. I'd highly recommend this tablet as a great buy. No problems with it at all."
B01EUC7NPI,36,357,this is a nice tablet. It's fast,Granny GG,5,Yes,22-Feb-17,1,0,"Either way you look at it, this is a nice tablet. It's fast, and smooth scrolling. Great for streaming audio or video. Candy crush crazes will love it too, it plays well. It's pretty much a mini computer it you like to do everything on your tab. Well worth it."
B01EUC7NPI,36,358,Samsung Tablet does not disappoint!,PDiddy,5,Yes,25-Sep-18,-,0,I purchased this table to replace my Lenovo Yoga tablet. I have been a fan of Samsung for quite some time. This table reinforces the fact that Samsung has quality products. This tablet is so much faster than my previous one. The quality of the picture and sound are incredible. I have an SD card to store videos and music.
B01EUC7NPI,36,359,S-Pen is poor design,Jess,2,Yes,27-Dec-17,1,0,"Good product and I've loved having it for art. But after only minor use my S-Pen nib broke inside the pen and it is literally impossibly to remove the nib and add in a new one if the tip breaks off. This has proven extremely frustrating as most stylus don't work with the product and a new S-Pen is expensive.Stupid, stupid design flaw in this product. Despite the problems with the pen it's a good device."
B01EUC7NPI,36,360,Piece of garbage.,Grizzly907LA,1,Yes,10-Sep-18,1,1,The f'ing screened died the day after the return window closed. Piece of crap product.
B01EUC7NPI,37,361,Works great but its pretty heavy.,Carla J,5,Yes,15-Aug-18,1,0,Works great but it is heavier than other tablets its size. Its not as comfortable to carry around with you as I would like because it is heavy. I wanted a tablet with a pen and needed a screen larger than 9.7 for drawing but didnt want to spend a lot. It definitely meets my needs. I also bought the Staedtler digital pencil for drawing. I love it.
B01EUC7NPI,37,362,"Nice tablet, great for reading and videos",AJ,5,Yes,14-Apr-19,-,0,"Tablet great for what i was looking for. Runs pretty quickly, screen looks great. Great size for reading and videos look good too. Some apps not designed for tablets but most still look fine. Wish charging port on bottom instead of top, minor nitpick though. Overall recommended"
B01EUC7NPI,37,363,Best of the best tablet I ever had,Ernie,5,Yes,09-Sep-17,1,0,Best of the best tablet I ever had. I have 4 Samsung Tab 10 inches and this is the best one. I always carrythis Tablet Tab 4 everyday aside from my Gaming fast Laptop. I recommend this Tablet.
B01EUC7NPI,37,364,Amazing,Katie,5,Yes,20-Mar-18,1,0,"This is a great tablet. If you like games this is great, I can play multiple games on this all day without having to charge it. The screen is bright and sharp. Totally recommend for anyone looking for a new tablet."
B01EUC7NPI,37,365,Only about 7 gb of useful space is available factory fresh,JRA,2,Yes,11-Mar-17,23,0,"Minus three stars for the 16 gb storage. Only about 7 gb of useful space is available factory fresh. Only installed a few apps (drawing/utility, not games) and was down to 5 gb. The OS and Samsung apps (which can't be removed) take up too much space for this tiny builtin memory. The memory slot does not help, only some apps can be moved to external storage because of that insufferable limitation of Android OS."
B01EUC7NPI,37,366,Very glad to take this step away from tablets with much more limited features.,Joe G.,5,Yes,24-Mar-18,-,0,"Coming off of an Asus Memo pad, the Samsung Tab A runs circles around the Asus. Of course it's newer, but this review is specific to my own needs. Great size and weight. Good battery life. Stylus feature is handy for note-taking with tablet screen off or on."
B01EUC7NPI,37,367,Stopped working a couple months in,Kaylin Brandt,1,Yes,18-Sep-18,1,0,Only had this Tablet since March now I have a black screen it stopped working around may/June. There is still sound coming out but no display. I had fixed it before when it had happened but a week later the same thing happened again only the fix didn’t work this time. Waste of money and I had all my art projects on there that I know can’t get to. Super disappointed
B01EUC7NPI,37,368,NO S NOTE APP..... ONLY SAMSUNG NOTE APP,Islandgirl,1,Yes,04-Feb-18,1,0,"The most important reason for purchase was S NOTE APP.

The screen, resolution was *just* low enough to notice pixleation of small text on screen.

Unfortunately I made the assumption that this tablet would be compatable with an S pen. It was not.

This tablet is lacking 1 gb of ram and the wacom screen required to perform with a pen."
B01EUC7NPI,38,372,"Great tablet with beautiful screen, all kinds of features, and *user profiles*",Keith Wingo,5,Yes,07-Jul-18,-,0,"Great tablet. Get a screen protector, a case, and a microSD memory card (I got a 200GB one).

The User Profiles feature is incredible. One for me, one for the wife, and a restricted one for kids / guests where you can lockdown which apps can and cannot be used."
B01EUC7NPI,38,373,Great device.,Invertfly,5,Yes,22-Jan-18,1,0,"Great device. We are a Samsung family and love the connectivity options that you get. Plus, for the price there is no comparison.

There was no way of editing this. I returned this and ordered an Amazon tablet which was only 8 inches instead. However, it is much easier to read.' Unfortunately, to date, to date, I have not received credit on my account for the returned Galaxy."
B01EUC7NPI,38,378,great product but slow shipping,Kevin,5,Yes,15-Sep-18,-,0,"great product it perfect. just as read. only one hitch I paid almost 14.00 for next day shipping and i couldnt track it.

B01EUC7NPI,38,380,Good value for a 10 screen.,A. K.,5,Yes,09-Jan-17,1,0,"Upgrading from a Google Nexus 10. Significant improvement. The screen colors are vibrant. Having an micro SD slot is a big plus (Nexus was limited to 16Gb internal memory which was getting pretty full. While the screen sizes are the same, the Tab A housing is slightly smaller and is lighter."
B01EUC7NPI,39,381,Great Tablet,Expressionality,5,Yes,13-Apr-17,1,0,"I am enjoying this Samsung Galaxy Tab A with S Pen.

B01EUC7NPI,39,387,Good for my artist,Tab,5,Yes,23-Jan-19,-,0,Purchased for my artist daughter so she could do more digital art and drawing. This was the most reasonable for the type of tablet we were looking for. She does not let it out of her sight much.
B01EUC7NPI,39,388,Great speed at this price,SciFi enthusiast,4,Yes,21-Mar-18,-,0,"Great speed and overall performance at this price level. I thought the 1.6 GHz processor would be overwhelmed easily , especially when a download etc is running in the background while I perform a google search, but no. It keeps up just fine. We bought this as a multi-use tablet and got more than I expected."
B01EUC7NPI,39,389,A good tablet.,Simcha,5,Yes,18-Jun-18,1,0,"Very good tablet, as good as the tab s2, but some difference in features.
I have the two of them. So it's easy to compare."
B01EUC7NPI,39,390,Great picture and controls,B. Bird,5,Yes,25-Jul-18,-,0,"There is a learning curve going from an iPad to the Tab, but it isn't too steep. Great picture and controls. Love the expandability and easy attachment of the Fintie keyboard and case I also purchased. I looks just like a giant Note 4. Having Office built in is a big plus."
B01EUC7NPI,40,391,It's a great tablet. It's fast the picture is good quality,C. Outerbridge,5,Yes,29-Sep-16,1,0,It's a great tablet. It's fast the picture is good quality. It feels like an over sized Samsung S6 which is a good thing. It works well with the Kindle Application for reading and the tablet is very responsive. I would highly recommend to anybody that wants a tablet for a good price.
B01EUC7NPI,40,392,Decently good. Better than other versions.,Brandon J. Jacob,4,Yes,15-Mar-18,-,0,"Doesn't quite have the responsiveness of some mobile devices I've owned, at least as far as games. I don't have it on a mobile data plan either, relying on Wi-Fi (Strong signal/speed) and still shows considerable lag in some games/applications nonetheless.Could be better, could certainly be worse. So far, can't say I'm disappointed with the purchase."
B01EUC7NPI,40,393,Good to very good,dvk,5,Yes,15-Nov-17,2,0,Good battery life and quality of image. Price/quality - balanced well.

The tablet is smooth and is of the great quality you would expect with a Galaxy. It's fast and the picture quality is sharp and crystal clear.
B01EUC7NPI,40,396,Great tablet!,sophiesmommy,5,Yes,21-Dec-17,1,0,"Love this tablet!
It's amazing! ..... pixel is clear; and the volume is adequate if you playing a short video, but you might not be happy with a full length movie."
B01EUC7NPI,40,397,"Small internal storage, not many apps can move to external",Ben,2,Yes,17-Aug-17,5,0,"It functions very well. But a huge complaint is it comes with so many default apps that take up most of the internal storage, then maybe half the apps you download can't be moved to the external storage. So even if you get external storage many apps you would want won't be able to be stored there meaning you can't download many apps. Which is frustrating. I have a hard team getting over this as my 64gn external storage card is barely used because few apps can be moved over. Meaning I am so limited on the apps I can download, often have to decide to delete some to make room for another. And get ""system storage space running out"" messages often.
But the overall functionality is great! The S pen works very well, videos look great on it, and it runs smoothly.
I use it as a kindle, PowerPoint presenter, and on flights or travel I download Netflix. Thankfully Netflix and kindle can be moved to the external storage.

I would not recommend it due to extremely limited storage space due to the small number of apps that can be put on the external drive."
B01EUC7NPI,40,398,i love it,Sara Rekstein,5,Yes,26-Feb-19,-,0,Im so happy I bought this. excellent picture quality...really good camera...nice sound level...fast...comes with many useful programs....long battery life...easy to use. would buy again...nicest computer like product I've ever owned.
B01EUC7NPI,40,399,Disappointed,D. L. McCray,1,Yes,25-Feb-19,1,0,"Product advertised an S pen but no pen in box, a clip was in box and charger but no pen. This was a birthday present myself and I opened it on my birthday 9 days after delivery. I would like an authentic S pen from Samsung not cheap replacement."
B01EUC7NPI,40,400,Doing its job,Amazon Customer,4,Yes,13-Dec-18,-,0,"Just got the tablet yesterday so can't say how it will last in the future.
The item box (not shipping box) came pretty beat up though.
The tablet itself is is pretty good shape. Seems to be doing its job so far."
B01EUC7NPI,41,401,I usually like Samsung. I used this a few dozen times,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,21-Nov-17,3,0,I usually like Samsung. I used this a few dozen times. It no longer turns on or will hold a charge. And it has not been damaged what so ever.

B01EUC7NPI,41,405,What an improvement!,callmebuds,5,Yes,10-Jan-17,2,0,"My old tablet was outdated, so I purchased this Samsung. I can hardly believe the improvement over my old tablet. The email and internet load about twice the speed, and it has met every challenge I have given it."
B01EUC7NPI,41,406,Necessities. A Must..,Roxann,5,Yes,15-Feb-19,-,0,"I got two of these as a gift. Worked out perfectly works great durable no problems no complaints works fast.. love it, works well. I would buy this again in a heart beat if I need too..."
B01EUC7NPI,41,407,Excellent battery life!,J. Paschal,5,Yes,30-Apr-17,5,0,"This is the first tablet I have owned that I feel compelled to leave a review. My review is not going to be a comparison but more of me adapting from a notebook computer. I love it. The problems I have had with navigating the net are going away as I am learning. The Email client that was supplied took a little to get used to I now think is great. The battery life is fantastic and the charge time is very quick.I love the screen size and lots of memory. I don't have to charge it as often as I did the 9.7"" tablet. All around I am adapting to tablet life and am very happy. The cons (if you consider it) the cord is extremely short!"
B01EUC7NPI,41,408,"good capacity, just what you'd expect from samsung",Bill,5,Yes,25-Apr-17,2,0,"bought it for our daughter, she loves it. Mission accomplished. Quick loading , good capacity, just what you'd expect from samsung, amazon price. Can't go wrong."
B01EUC7NPI,41,409,Horrible. Kept turning off,Ronda,1,Yes,20-Feb-17,23,0,"Horrible. Kept turning off, could even transfer data from tablet to tablet, it wouldn't stay on long enough.
Returned, bought another from another retailer, assured it was a fluke, today it turned itself off 10 times. Google search, very common problem. I wasted 20 dollars on screen savers....... Don't buy"

B01EUC7NPI,42,411,"Decent 10"" tablet",Hobson,4,Yes,24-May-17,1,0,"I like the tablet. I am a musician, so it has added a lot of availability to all of my songs without carrying several 3"" binders. On the downside, it needs to be rebooted too often, I think. WiFi doesn't always pick up the first time through."
B01EUC7NPI,42,412,LIKE CANNOT CHANGE TIME ZONE ETC,Amazon Customer,3,Yes,22-Jun-18,-,0,"I CANNOT RATE IT ANY HIGHER AS I AM STILL HAVING TROUBLE, LOTS OF SIMPLE THINGS ...LIKE CANNOT CHANGE TIME ZONE

B01EUC7NPI,42,413,Great Tablet,Dog Walker,4,Yes,18-Jul-17,1,0,I really like this tablet and I am impressed with how well it stays connected to the WiFi at home and at work.

B01EUC7NPI,42,415,screen went black 3 months out of warranty,Nastassja Riemermann,2,Yes,23-Feb-18,-,0,"Generally speaking, this is a great Tablet. However, 3 months after the 1 year warranty expired, the screen went black, and apparently Samsung will charge me $30 just to look at it. (Worse for me, I have become unemployed since purchasing the tablet, and don't have that kind of money.)"
B01EUC7NPI,42,416,A Sharp Tablet,Superdave,5,Yes,31-Oct-18,-,0,"I use my tablet mostly for genealogy work, and it works nicely. The screen resolution is very nice, as well as the size. Photos show up sharp and bright. For the money, I got a good tablet."
B01EUC7NPI,42,417,I enjoy my tablet,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,08-Dec-18,1,0,Really enjoy this tablet. I am getting back into graphic art and I find this easy to use with the apps on the play store. I am really impressed with the pen functionality. There’s no lag from when the pen touches the tablet to writing or drawing on the screen. I also enjoy it for watching Netflix and Hulu.

Samsung says the only solution is to drive hours to a tech support kiosk at Best Buy. This is not what I expect from Samsung."
B01EUC7NPI,42,420,Great tablet; equal to or better than the Kindle of the same size.,Michael A. Feuerstein,5,Yes,02-Jan-18,-,0,"I've only had this since Christmas, but so far I love it. It's a lot faster than the older Samsung tablet I recently donated. It has a beautiful display. It was easy to learn how to use; it's very similar to using as my Samsung S7. The battery seems to be lasting a long time, I haven't run it down yet."
B01EUC7NPI,43,421,Great screen.,JR,5,Yes,12-Jan-18,1,0,This replaced my samsung/google nexus tab. Big improvement. Great screen....its quick...and the battery lasts a lot longer.
B01EUC7NPI,43,422,Great for Samsung/Android users.,Amanda,5,Yes,12-Jun-18,-,0,"My parents LOVE android’s OS, and samsung devices.

B01EUC7NPI,43,423,Great Product,W. Halcomb,5,Yes,24-Dec-16,-,0,"I bought this tablet, for my brother in-law, to keep in touch. I have heard nothing, but how wonderful it is, he raves about it constantly, about finding new things it can do. It surpasses, all my expectations of what a great tablet could be. Through Amazon, I got the best possible price available, I couldn't be more happy with my purchase."
B01EUC7NPI,43,424,Great Value!,William A Groh Jr,5,Yes,18-Sep-18,-,0,To be fair I ordered an additional 120 of memory with this. I could not be happier with this tablet. It does everything I need it to do and the voice recognition is excellent. Worth every penny.
B01EUC7NPI,43,425,Excellent for taking notes in class,Amy,5,Yes,12-Sep-18,-,0,"Using it everyday for note taking in class and for annotating PDFs/ppts etc. Light weight, so quite handy to read ebooks/papers etc. Very useful for students. Can handle pretty much all student needs except coding and running heavy duty softwares. Would highly recommend for students."
B01EUC7NPI,43,426,The Tab A Lived Up to My High Expectations,James L. Henley,5,Yes,21-Apr-17,3,0,"I was living with an aging iPad2 which was incredibly slow at rendering web pages. The Tab A is like greased lightening. Instead of taking a nap while waiting for Facebook to load, it now flicks on the screen within 1 to 2 seconds. People who say you don't benefit from cpu speed if only browsing the internet are wrong. HTML5 takes a lot of effort to render. The 8-core cpu is great. The connectivity is vastly better than with the iPad2. And, of course, I have plugged in a 64gig Class 10 MicroSDXC chip. With the Android 6.0.1 that came on the machine, I can choose to use the extra memory as main memory allowing me to install zillions of apps. I didn't choose this option, though. The 16gigs seems to be enough for the apps I use. I use the extra memory for music, etc.. The S-pen seems to work as advertised. I don't really use it. I got it so that my partner can do art on it. He likes it. The iPad2 causes me considerable discomfort trying to support it due to its weight. The narrow edge bites into my palm and my arm complains after only a few minutes. This did not improve much with the Tab A. It is lighter, but not much. The only real complaint I have is that the 14 hour battery takes forever to charge. If the charge is down to say 40% when I plug it in before going to bed, in the morning it may be only 75 to 80% charged. That's using the supplied charger. It might not damage the battery to use a higher powered charger, but I'm afraid to try it. Oh, and it's slippery as is the iPad2. I put velcro squares on the back to hold a rubbery mesh place-mat that I cut down to size. This makes it much easier to hang onto."
B01EUC7NPI,43,427,am very happy with this one,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,30-Nov-17,1,0,"My old tablet finally died, am very happy with this one, was very easy to set up, was easy to link it with my old tablet and transfer all my info. I would buy this again for a gift"
B01EUC7NPI,43,428,Great Tablet for Artists,Purple Lady,5,Yes,17-Dec-18,-,0,"I mainly use this tablet for my digital art, and the S Pen that is included works very well. Draws just like you were using a real pencil! The battery so far is very good and lasts me a few days without charging. Highly recommend if you are looking for a reasonably priced tablet."
B01EUC7NPI,43,429,Good value,Terry Lee,5,Yes,20-Dec-18,-,0,"Works fine, has good battery life and minimal spam ware. If anyone knows how to get rid of samsung's spamming the calendar with ""luscious Linda"" on tues. and ""Delightful Deloris"" on thurs., please let me know."

Back will NEVER come off without breaking !!",JM,1,Yes,19-Jan-18,4,0,Never ever ever ever buy this thing. The screen will go black past your warranty. And then you will research how to take off the back because that's what all 'fix it' sites tell you to do. You will then realize it's impossible to take the back off without breaking it.

B01EUC7NPI,44,437,"If you are going to store a lot data or install a lot of apps, get a microSD card.",Amazon Customer,3,Yes,11-Sep-18,-,0,"The tablet build while on the heavy side is excellent. I really like the 1900 x 1200 screen which is great for watching movies and working with two apps at the same time. The tablet blended very well into my workflow thanks to the Microsoft software and the S pen. The SoC won't win any speed comparisons but I have not had any performance issues. The tablet came with Android Marshmallow installed, but it was upgraded to Noughat 7.0 within two weeks of my purchase."

B01EUC7NPI,48,478,"Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1"" 16 GB",Brian Reid,5,Yes,20-Dec-16,3,0,"This was purchased as a replacement for my Samsung Tab A 9.7"" after it was either lost or misplaced by my 1 year old granddaughter. I am completely satisfied and impressed with the added features of this compared to the 9.7"" tablet. The speed of the Octa Core processor vs. the Quad Core is very impressive. The graphics/resolution are much more crisp and cleaner compared to the 9.7"" (1920 x 1200 pixels as opposed to the 1024 x 768). The preloaded Marshmallow OS is a nice upgrade and more stable than the Lollipop 5.0. This tab comes with a bit of bloatware but quite honestly, it isn't as bad as some reviewers implicated. This comes with MS Office for Android preinstalled which is great due to the fact that I am an avid user of Office. As for the battery right out of the box, after setup, updates, installation of apps I frequently use and a couple days of work, the battery was only down to 84%. I watched a couple Youtube videos, played a couple hours of music and used it for a few other things and finally charged it even though it was still at 60%. So yes, the battery holds up great! This tablet is a nice tool for use in my home office as well as work. The immediate out-of- box setup took just a few minutes to get up and running. It is extremely user friendly. I am sure that my older grandchildren will find this awesome for long trips to watch movies in the car. Now to keep it away from some little tiny one year old hands and I believe this will hold out for the next couple of years."
B01EUC7NPI,48,479,Great battery life and screen definition,Amazon Customer,4,Yes,14-Jul-18,-,0,Great battery life and screen definition. Only thing is that it easily goes to a black screen when rotated on touch on a certain spot. Lol still trying to figure this one out. Great product for price

Since I ended up with only 6GB to play with after using Smart Switch, this means I have to download some content, then manually move it to the SD card before downloading more.

There is no way that I can see to default the Google Movies & TV app to the SD card unless there is a trick to merge the internal and SD memory to appear as a single entity..."

Was considering the 10"" Kindle Fire but got tired of the ""custom"" android system. This tablet has been a great leaning experience as I didn't know what I was missing. The tablet is slightly heavier than I am used to but is ok. The battery lasts a lot longer than I am used to. Of course it depends what you are doing and if you are a heavy gamer that can change the time you have on the battery. I put in a 128gb sd card for external storage which is great for me. I am still learning about the ""S"" pen. I also have a Infiniti keyboard case so most times I use my tablet instead of my laptop. Very glad I bought it."
B01EUC7NPI,54,532,Fast and quality android tablet. Clear and sharp display. Excellent quality.,russell,5,Yes,25-Dec-17,1,0,Fast and quality android tablet. Clear and sharp display. Excellent quality.

B01EUC7NPI,54,536,Superb Tablet and Great iPad Replacement,DonJulio,5,Yes,08-Jan-18,3,0,"I have now gone thru 3 iPads from the very beginning, and after the 3rd and looking at the cost, I decided to move to a Samsung Tab. While the iPad is more intuitive for a new user, in my case this provided more features, access to a great number of useful apps, does not require that everything go through iTunes, and with the removable storage and USB provides much more functionality.

I opted for the Tab A 10.1 as it features a 16:9 display, ideal for watching movies. The added battery life helps as well. Image quality is great, and with built-in business apps, this tablet provides more functionality than an iPad for work and at a considerably lower cost.

Octa-core processor is quite powerful and with 2 GB of RAM, this tablet is smooth to operate, has a very good response time, has never dropped a wifi signal, plays movies well with good sound, streams to my TV via chromecast or screen mirroring, surfs the web without problems. It has good on board memory that can be expanded and it has the flexibility to choose between on board or sd card storage. So far I have not found anything I do not like and would definitely recommend this tablet.

I give this 5 stars."

I use it mainly for studying (taking notes digitally with the s-pen, reading textbooks, etc.) and have to say that it is just perfect. The size is great, the screen is fantastic and the battery life is just amazing! The s-pen really is good enough for writing or drawing. Game performance may be lacking, but since I don't play games, it is perfect for me."

IMO the best overall from a price point, battery capacity, functionality, and speed. I was looking at the Tab S3 but this is half the price and has a bigger battery. Used to have iPad Mini 4 but that had no pen. Great product for media consumption, general browsing, and note taking/sketching."
B01EUC7NPI,56,552,The only reason for 4 stars is that the home ...,Patsi,4,Yes,04-Feb-17,1,0,The only reason for 4 stars is that the home and return buttons are on the short instead of the wide side.

B01EUC7NPI,59,587,Nice Tablet by Samsung,Chris & Wendy,5,Yes,07-Apr-18,-,0,Love it! I bought white b/c it was more affordable. It's easy to use. I think we will buy another. Speed is fast. We did my more memory. It came right away.
B01EUC7NPI,59,588,Just Right!,Harrison Whitebread,5,Yes,12-Apr-17,2,0,"I was skeptical about this purchase when I read reviews about random shut downs. I have no such problems. Wifi connectivity is dual band & solid, speed is snappy and the display is vivid & responsive. My first Samsung tablet was the Tab A 7"". Compared to it, this model is hands down the flagship. It runs 6.0.1, the battery is great, and the form factor is just right for movies and games. Some might feel it's on the larger side of comfort, but if you're like me and have large hands and long fingers, typing and holding this tablet is a no-brainer.

I personally use this 10.1 for interval sets for the athletes I train. They can clearly see the timer and the speaker is plenty loud enough, albeit in the bottom of the tablet (odd placement).

I'm most impressed with the price point. This is superbly competitive with any iPad, especially with expandable storage (save for the adoptable storage feature disabled by default). Buyer beware, if you plan to mod or do any developer-type things with this device, KNOX 2 will be eager to void any warranty. Personally, I think this tablet is setup pretty well. Samsung Kids is not permanently installed and many apps not available on 5.1.1 are compatible with 6.0.1 on this tablet. I grew fond of the Samsung Music player, which is only available via secondary mirrors on 5.1.1 tablets (like the Tab A 7""). It is native on this device.

Overall, I would highly recommend this tablet. It's priced well, it seems reliable (I will edit if ""IT"" hits the fan), and I like the portability of my PC in a smaller form factor. It comes preloaded with Office and Onedrive - and if you sign in with your account, you'll get 100 GB of online storage. Sweet deal."
B01EUC7NPI,59,589,16gb hard drive isn't enough,Awesome73,4,Yes,23-Jan-18,-,0,"Everything you want and need in a tablet!

S Pen is awesome. Looking forward to the 7.0 Nougat upgrade that is expected with the next month. Added a 256 GB SD card. With 16 GB of space, so far with having installed a moderate level of apps and games and having installed/moved all pictures and files to the SD (only 12.5 GB on the card so far) after operating system and installed apps I have 4.8 GB of free space.

The battery life is extremely long. I’m a student and I only have to charge this once every 3 days. I use this for note taking and homework. The only issue I have is with the bloatware it comes with, but disabling it isn’t an issue. Sadly I bought it for about $270, but I think you can buy it for $250 depending on who’s the seller and if they’re in stock. Either way, it’s worth the money."

B01EUC7NPI,65,644,"Thank you, Amazon!",Co&Be,1,Yes,22-Dec-17,8,1,"I got this tablet fearing that my 3 1/2 year old Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 wouldbsoon die. Wrong. My old tablet is still running, while this one has been a total disappointment.
I got it in October. After only one week, the Tab A wouldn't send or receive email. I did a factory reset and it started sending email again, but the problem came back in ten days.
In December, I called Samsung and talked to a representative OVERSEAS who had extreme difficulty with the English language. After she attempted to control the tablet remotely, she decided that I had to send it to Samsung Service. Samsung sent me a UPS prepaid label, they kept the tablet for a few days and I got it back after a week. Again, the tablet received and sent email for a few days. I waited a few days more and called Samsung for the second time. They sent me another UPS prepaid label and back went the tablet for inspection. In ten days, the gablet was back and, once again, it failed to receive or send email. I called Samsung and requested a REFUND. This was February 2018
Eventually, Samsung sent me an email asking me how I wanted to get my money back. They also wanted a copy of my invoice from Amazon. I took a photo of the invoice and tried to attach it to the email sent by Samsung to no avail. Samsung did not allow files larger than 999KB. I tried to resize the file, but it was still too big for Samsung.
Tired of so much coming and going, I called Amazon customer service to ask them if they could email me a copy of my invoice. I explained about my photo being too large, etc, etc. To my utter surprise, the rep from Amazon told me that Amazon could give me a refund. I honestly thought the rep was wrong, since I have always thought we cannot return anything after one month has passed. She explained there are special cases where Amazon offers a refund, and this one was one of those cases. In 48 hours, Amazon refunded the total amount I had paid for the Tab A 4 months earlier.
I was told I did not havevto return the tablet and I could do whatever I wanted with it. Though the gab has a good image and good sound, I still don't know if I will keep it. It is obvious that I got a lemon.
I want to warn everyone about this tablet. I got a lemon, but one thing is obvious: this tablet was beyond repair.
Thank you Amazon once again. I have been buying from Amazon on a weekly basis for more than 15 years and I have never been disappointed."

But it came out to be a real Samsung device. Customizing it so it has the look of a Galaxy S8, I actually love the look. This tablet feels gigantic in my hand because it's not oriented landscape-wise. The only downside was the Wi-Fi part. It says I have one bar when I'm close to the router. But it still loads context from the internet fairly fast. The battery life is exponential. It lasts really long. It's a good buy. I recommend for you to get it, especially if you're going to draw."

B01EUC7NPI,70,691,Perfect media consumption / light gaming tablet,John park,4,Yes,04-Nov-16,9,0,"I've only had this tablet for a few months but so far it's been just what I was looking for in a tablet, albeit with a few minor quirks. Starting off, the size of this tablet is about as large as I think the average person would want. It's just barely small enough for me to type comfortably on the keyboard with my thumbs, but the large screen makes it a joy to type on if you prop it up on a stand or a folding case which is how I personally use it the majority of the time. Watching videos and reading web articles is awesome with this screen size and is vastly more enjoyable than a 7 or 8 inch tablet, and though some people will say the 4:3 aspect ratio that the ipads and newer galaxy tab S have is better for reading I never had any trouble with it. This tablet also gets way brighter than I was expecting, I usually keep it around 60 - 70 percent inside during the day and no more than 40 in the dark. A couple of my gripes with this tablet is the positioning of the back button which is way too easy to hit when holding it in landscape, and also that the auto wake / sleep feature is a bit touchy and triggers far too often when I fold the case on the back of the tablet, but this might just be a problem with my particular case. Also, don't expect to run games at high detail on this, playing riptide renegade gp on max settings destroyed the fps on this tablet but I imagine most people will be playing less demanding games when using this. All in all for a tablet at this price I wasn't at all disappointed but wasn't exactly blown away by the design or performance, still a good buy in my opinion."
B01EUC7NPI,70,692,"Great tablet, good value.",XYooper,5,Yes,11-Sep-18,-,0,"My laptop died one day after receiving this Samsung tablet. I am using this tablet for almost everything that I used the laptop for - checking emails, surfing the internet, buying items etc. It`s much more portable than a laptop but I recommend getting a good sturdy case cover for it to protect it and it's easier to hold."
B01EUC7NPI,70,693,Great. Only one thing,Professional Online Shopper,4,Yes,01-Mar-18,-,0,Great. Only one thing... Samsung did not BACK LIGHT THE SOFT KEYS like they do on the Samsung phones. You cannot see the soft buttons in the dark.

So far, it has been fast, reliable and easy to use. Great screen. Needed to buy some connection devices to plug in USB or other cards, but that wasn't expensive. Added a case with Bluetooth keyboard, so it's easier for heavy typing. Only complaint is that I wish it came with a file management program and less junk I don't want or need."

B01EUC7NPI,75,749,Love it!,Alex Bigelow,5,Yes,19-Apr-17,3,0,"First tablet I've owned, so maybe I'm a little biased, but I honestly adore this thing. Crazy long battery life and quick charging, too. It's got a big enough screen to be convenient (and easy to watch TV on, if that's your jam) but small enough to be portable. Speakers aren't fabulous, but easy enough to play games, or hear TV dialogue on. I haven't really tested the durability (and hope I never will) but it's survived a few spills. Brightness is very adjustable, settings are intuitive. I don't love typing on it, but it's a touch screen, what do you expect? There are plenty of keyboard accessories out there, if that's an issue. Oh, and cases for this tab are abundant and adorable. It's all I wanted out of a tablet and then some!"

B01EUC7NPI,76,753,Multifunctional and Beautiful Tablet!,IgnoreIgnorance,5,Yes,17-Mar-17,2,0,"Where do I start with this review? In Beastmode, of course! This tablet far surpasses my ipad..sorry Apple! The split screen function allows me to check emails and surf the web or finish watching a movie simultaneously! I carry this tablet around to meetings to handwrite my notes (helps me better internalize and remember things than typing does) and i can draw whatever i need to on the page to give vision to my creatuve thoughts! I also use it for leisure and travel to stream movies or tv. Multiple writing tool sizes and colors available as a standard feature. You can write a note on the locked screen or a full pages of notes right from the homescreen which I love! I stream movies and watch sports on live tv using two separate apps simultaneously. I love this tablet! If i was in college or high school again, I would ditch the paper and go with this tablet only! Something you should know: I was not paid or given a free/reduced cost for writing this review so purchase it now and start living paperless! The earth Thanks You in advance!"
B01EUC7NPI,76,754,I love this device!,Bill B,5,Yes,03-Apr-17,2,0,"I recently upgraded from my 1st tablet, a Kindle Fire HD. Had it for several years and it was a good device. But I wanted something larger and definitely wanted several things it just could not do.

1) A faster, better processor. The limitations became more and more a real issue as it aged. 2) A larger screen. Love this 10 inch view. 3) True HD resolution. There are even better screens out there but, to me, not worth the significant higher price. 4) Amazon's OS was too limiting. I wanted greater access to a number of apps that it would not allow to operate. One favorite of mine is my Vudu account. Now, points 2 and 3 allow me to watch my movies on a large screen and in HD. 5) Expanded memory. The 16 gbs on the Fire was half gone with the OS and apps I did not want. Added a couple more and it was nearly full. This came with 16 and allows up to another 200. I now have my music library on the same device with lots of room left. I don't have to have my phone handy, which also has my music library.

This is a beautiful tablet that delivers on all the things the Fire started but could not finish. Yes, there is a fair amount of bloat ware on it that can not be deleted. I can live with that as I do not want to root the device. And I downloaded the Amazon app to keep taking advantage of the pluses of doing music and book purchases. One thing I would change is the speaker location. I would love to see them at the top and sides and activate based on device rotation. But, a minor quibble. The camera is not nearly as good as my Samsung phone but I do not expect to use it much, if at all.

It is a huge step up from the Kindle tablets. And provides a high quality experience with the Ipad expense. This has met and exceeded my expectations."
B01EUC7NPI,76,755,great,Stride,5,Yes,23-Dec-18,-,0,my daily driver. there should be more large tablets.

B01EUC7NPI,76,760,Good Tab S3 and I pad pro alternative in my opinion,Richard Jamar Boyer,4,Yes,27-Mar-17,9,0,"This tablet has a lot going for it!! In my household I use my tablets more then I use my laptop because it is less bulky. Originally I wanted a good stylus to take notes so I was going to get the new Samsung Tab S3 or the Ipad Pro but at $599.99 (an extra $100 for the stylus for the Ipad) they were way to pricey then I found this on sale here at amazon for $299.99. Here are a list of Pros and Cons I've found since using the tablet.

PROS
1) Bright Full HD screen
2) S pen and all the features that come with it (Also I love the fact that I can stow it away in the tablet so I wont loose it. VERY HANDY)
3) Fast and zippy so far
4) 16 x 9 Aspect ratio is perfect for watching movies
5) Perfect for drawing and taking notes
6) Price isn't to bad ( good Tab S3 alternative)
7) Great battery life
8) Slit screen capabilities

CONS
1) Hasn't been updated to Android N (Though it might be in the future but I can live with Android Marshmallow
2) No super Amoled Screen just LCD (but still sharp and nice screen none the less)
3) Experiencing a little lag from time to time
4) Speakers are just okay
5) A little on the heavy side

In conclusion I can honestly say this is a great product. One that I hope to Use for a long while."

B01EUC7NPI,79,784,I really wanted to love this tablet but it left me meh,Anthony W.,3,Yes,01-Dec-16,9,1,"I'll start with the reasons why I returned it. At first I thought it was my mobile Hotspot not providing fast speeds to this tablet so I switched it over to my work WiFi, it's the FAA so it's not ghe fastest, and thought ""well maybe the Internet is just being slow today"". So I tested it at home and it was still slow while my other devices, including Samsung, were zooming right along. It took over an hour to download from Google one 20 minute video, web browsing was frustrating, and watching videos on YouTube would buffer. I'm not sure what is wrong with this tablet.
It's also heavy, very heavy for day to day use while holding it.
Typing on a big screen was delightful; however, this 2016 tablet had no haptic feedback...seriously?
The bottom facing speakers is odd. For a 10"" tablet they should be on each side but I knew that upon purchase but the quality is poor and tinny.
The good of this device is that the screen is beautiful and very usable in direct daylight. The battery life isn't the greatest but you can get 2 days of heavy use in and still have 20% left."

B01EUC7NPI,80,791,Good tablet for the price!,Justin C.,4,Yes,30-Nov-16,9,0,"I received this tablet as a gift after picking it out. I compared this one to the Tab E and after reading many, many reviews and visiting sites, this one was the one that worked best for what I wanted it for. I use this tablet for Facebook, Pinterest, Amazon (ha.), and the occasional web surfing.
The only thing I have found that really bothers me is the touch sensitivity. I have adjusted the settings and it takes multiple times of me clicking on what i want for it to register.
When it comes to connecting it to Bluetooth, I have no problems what so ever. I use a Keyboard with it that connects to Bluetooth and it connects instantly. Same with Wi-Fi. I have a Google Chrome Cast and it connects 9X better than my phone does to it.
The sound quality on it is great as well. I have listened to music, watched news videos, and watch game play-throughs on it, all without any issues. You can even hear the breaths of people on this. Streaming quality is great, little to no lag unless my Wi-Fi is acting up.
The screen size is perfect for books and movies, without being a laptop size. I would even go a step further and say that it would be good for kids to play games on it, as long as there is a case. It's a little hard to reach the middle of the screen with small hands like I have, so a case is a must.

Overall: Very durable, great screen resolution, great sound, and only negative is the lack of touch registration at times."

Was surfing the internet quiet often and watched live videos on YouTube for about 2 hours. Not to forget that I listening to music on YouTube in between. The tab a 10.1 is very fast in everything I am doing and I am more then happy that I have purchased it finally, after watching many many reviews on youtube lol. I don't wanna talk about the price because, alone the quality of this tablet and how it's build , is much more worth IN MY opinion and easy on the same level like so many other tablets out there they much higher in price. Also I would recommend this Tab A10.1 with S pen without a doubt. !!!"

I only used twice and stopped using after I discovered there was an issue.
Also, I have had an issue with the tablet glitching periodically. It's like a blink that occurs while I'm using tablet. Im not sure what is causing that but I was using my sons Samsung 4 tablet before purchasing this and didn't have this issue."

B01EUC7NPI,84,838,Very nice but has some quirks.,Michael P.,5,Yes,02-Dec-16,17,0,"Nice screen res, like my Note 4 & Note 7 but on a larger platform. A lot of the nice Note 7 features were applied here.
16GB of internal memory is a joke and even though I have a 256GB card installed I am having trouble moving apps to the card because a lot of the pre-installed bloatware cannot be deleted or moved to the card.
Also I do prefer the s pen location on the Tab A 9.7 2015 which is at the top right side which extracts sideways. I found that to be a more logical location than the bottom right on the 10.1 as it feels more natural to reach the pen from that position and start to use it rather than to pull it out from the bottom of the device towards the floor.
One more gripe but this is true for any tablet ... has two speakers located at the bottom of the portrait position ... don't understand why they can't install one more speaker at the other side and set it up that it activates once the device is rotated into the landscape position when watching movies so you have stereo speakers regardless of the screen orientation ... simple and logical fix which solves the speaker location issue on ALL of the tablets (not just this one). Regardless, I don't want to leave the impression that I only have complaints ...this is a great device for my needs and even better since I purchased it when there was a $100 discount ($250 out the door!). I highly recommend it to anyone who takes advantage of the s pen features or is a Note (phone) fan that needs a Tablet."

This is a great, simple tablet for those who don't like a lot of extra stuff included with the tablet usage (except for the included bloatware, which I can turn off).

It will be a great tool to keep up with home when I will be travelling later in the year; a good way to stay in touch. Since I researched the best machine for what I needed and had intended in using, this works just fine. For the money spent, I'm very happy."

B01EUC7NPI,97,968,A nice tablet for the basics,BigD277,4,Yes,09-Aug-17,2,0,"If you are a Samsung Note 5 phone user, this is basically the same thing in a tablet version. Works fine, does what is supposed to do. A few cons:

1. SD card gives you extra storage, but you can't download anything on it. You have to manually move apps to the SD card, which is just a pain. Some apps have to stay in internal storage. Don't know why this is. Android thing? Samsung thing? Don't know. Don't care. It's dumb.
2. Buttons on the bottom are prone to accidental touch. It's not a big deal, but it is still a deal.
3. No ability to integrate Samsung Notes with Evernote. You can do it with S-Note on the Note 5. But not on the Tab A. Why not? Only God knows.
4. No easy way to get Amazon Video. Amazon thing? Samsung thing? Don't know. Don't care. It's dumb.

Otherwise, I enjoy Samsung products and have found them to be the most innovative and reliable wireless products using the Android platform."

I have to give great kudos to Amazon Customer Service -- most especially their floor Manager Nicholas. There was an error in the ordering system which caused a delay in my delivery of an older model. This had a minor impact to my work, but the solution created by Nicholas was one that will keep me a loyal Amazon Prime Member for quite a while. It is very nice to see that the Customer Experience is not lost with Amazon, and they invest wisely in their culture and business philosophy. I'm a fan! 5-stars and beyond for Nicholas and the Prime Membership team."

We charged, rebooted which only produced flickering logos and a continued black screen. We mailed it back for repair, which cleaned the device of all of my children's apps, and a few months later black unresponsive screen again! I ended up returning both for a partial refund. I just wanted to end the nightmare before I would be stuck with a useless device.

Also Google apps seem to stay linked together under a single logon ID even with multiple Google IDs set up on the unit such as E-mail and Google Hangouts.
Lightweight even w folding case - stand with a BT KB & mouse carried around. Wireless / Bluetooth only model no Cellular - this saved a few hundred on price + ongoing cell fees. About only real benefit I see in the cellular type is GPS while on the road, If I am riding as a passenger I can use my cell phone as a hot spot instead if I need internet + it has GPS in it."

For example, using S-pen shortcut menu, I can easily create a screenshot of stock chart. Then, I write my note over the screenshot and save in Gallery or Scrapbook for the future reference. Precision of S-pen makes this type of application very very useful. Writings created using other pads without the stylus are very thick and clumsy, but with S-pen Galaxy pad is so much more useful.
Another nice application is to use it like a white board. It is better than any whiteboard. If you remove S-pen before turn on the tablet, it is presented with black screen (like blackboard). You can draw, erase, change the thickness of pen. You can scroll the screen down for more writings(draw). ( it appears to be unlimited scroll down. I do not know for sure). Then it can be saved."

B01EUC7NPI,118,1172,My new drawing Tab,Gale L Porter,5,Yes,28-Apr-17,7,0,"I've been wanting a tablet to use for drawing for done time now, ever since the Surface Pro came out I had it in my mind to get one. But the price range was murder for my wallet, especially for an amateur artist I just couldn't justify spending ~$1,000 on a sophisticated drawing tablet. In comes my recent visit to Best Buy I stumbled on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, which came out recently. I could not put it down, that display has a handful of my drawings still. Well I went home determined to find an older version, or a used one for a fair price; $600 was still in that high end range but alot more doable.

I ended up finding out the Tab A was the perfect ""budget"" tablet, and it had a version that came with the S-Pen! I looked up reviews and YouTube videos to see how laggy the pen function was. I learned that Samsung recently released a Tab A 10.1"" with slightly upgraded specs, perfect! So I went from $1,000 to $600 down to $300, my dream is becoming a reality sooner than I expected. I was fine with getting a used one, saved me another $50 off the top and I just had to be ok with minor blemishes. Slap on Next-Day shipping for a measly $10 and poof, I'm the happiest amateur digital artist you could imagine.

I agree with most of the reviews although I couldn't find many regarding the newer version, showing how the S-Pen performed and any caveats one might run into. As far as my experience has gone, I've been pleased with my device it's outperformed my expectations. But in saying that I also have a few annoyances, such as the button on the S-Pen doesn't really have any purpose. In some apps you can use it for like an eraser, which I wish was the default for everything (S Note for example) or being able to customize it. Also they provide 6 nibs for the S-Pen, 3 gray and 3 white which supposedly are soft/hard but nowhere does it explain which is which. The speakers are not the loudest things but they do the job, surprising that there's two of them but they are relatively quiet.

I haven't tested the camera but I do like that there's a flash so I can use a flashlight when I don't have my phone. Multitasking also works great, better than my phone as I'm able to watch YouTube videos and draw with no lag whatsoever. I generally use the tablet for drawing and I'm getting better at it but I don't know how the tablet performs for other uses, if I do I will update my review but as far as drawing goes I would recommend it for anyone interested in getting into digital art.

It looks like the Tab A recently went on sale, I don't know if it will last but it seemed to drop down to about $250 - I believe it was the 9.7"" version though, I could be mistaken."

B01EUC7NPI,121,1208,Solid Mid-Range Contender,Ross Carrell,4,Yes,05-Sep-17,-,0,"This review is for the S-Pen version.

First, there is a size difference between the S-Pen and plain Tab A. If you're buying accessories double check the compatibility as the plain Tab A is the more common 'supported' option. I picked up a case and screen shield but both are apparently for the non-S-Pen version. Case was a complete waste but at least the screen shield 'fit' till i get the urge to buy the correct one.

I decided to upgrade from the smaller and less expensive Asus tablets I've bought for myself but couldn't justify the full blown 12.2"" Tab price. For a Galaxy device, i'm impressed.

There isn't really much bloatware. Of course you have the obligatory Samsung apps but they're easily ignored. This is a zippy device and offers significant speed increase over the less expensive tablets I've been using. As soon as i powered it up the upgrade to Android 7.0 was ready to download and install. Everything went smoothly and now i'm cruising along with everything i need the tablet to handle.

The battery is pretty impressive. From a full charge, with some very basic use and standby for two days i opened it up to 91% charge. Took about 10 minutes to top it off.

I've only had it for about a week at this point but it seems like a stable device. There are custom ROMs available but i'm not sure at this point if it'd be worth the effort since i'm more of a casual user than a power user. Time will tell."

Love the UI, it's more like Grace on the Note7 than Standard ""LagWiz"". I've been a Note user for a long time, and this tablet makes you feel right at home. I actually chose this over the S2 to have an S Pen. It's a little slow and laggy, but the S Pen is worth the speed cost to me. It is well worth the extra money over the regular Tab A . More RAM, better screen and the SPen. Note users understand I'm sure. It's not the top of the line,I knew that going in, but hey, you can buy several of these for the cost of an iPad 9.7"". Even two plus over the S2. Screen is as good or better than iPad too. Happy so far, runs apps okay, even used OTG and a Bluetooth keyboard with Office apps onboard. Makes a useable laptop in a pinch. I would buy it again.
Edit 1/24/17
Still think it ok, but have found it to be buggy. Software glitches often. OTG caused my mouse to do crazy things the second time I used it. S Pen really makes me miss my Note7. It's great. Have found that closing all background apps and restarting everyday helps, the minute you notice a lag or glitch just sloes all apps. Took one star away, it's still probably the best mid range tablet I've used, miles better than Lenovo, even Lenovo's so called premium tablets and laptops. Worth the $280 I paid. So far, I'm still happy. I knew what I was buying. Still, I would prefer a Snapdragon over the Eyxnos, but then again that would mean probably another $100+. Don't think anyone wanting something to mainly surf, watch YouTube, or do email will be disappointed, it's very capable in those areas. Probably would make a decent reader, I haven't tried that. Haven't tried gaming, though I wouldn't expect it to be very proficient in that department. I still would buy it again if I was on a tight budget, but still wanted a very useful and capable tablet. And it would be a magnificent student tablet, the note taking and drawing abilities are super. Even at full price,$349 retail, you can buy 4 of these vs 1 iPad Pro, minus the Apple Pencil. And they will support a 256gb card for all the storage you want."

B01EUC7NPI,136,1358,Great tablet for students,Thrifty Student,5,Yes,15-Mar-17,8,0,"Great tablet for students!

I had the last generation of this model. While I wasn't fond of the low resolution, the pen made writing notes in class a breeze, which was the main reason I picked up the tablet. This model fixes that problem (the resolution is now lovely) and the Android ecosystem has a lot of great apps that take advantage of the S-pen. Battery life is pretty good as well, and I can pretty much use this tablet all day (9-10 hours) without worrying about charging when I use it as a notebook. Watching videos/playing games will of course deplete the battery life a bit quicker.

If you're looking for S-pen apps, while the included Samsung Notes is pretty nice, I recommend Papyrus/Squid, and Sketchbook (if you're interested in drawing!)"
B01EUC7NPI,136,1359,Love this new tablet from Samsung.,Rick D.,5,Yes,22-Sep-16,1,0,"I've now owned several Samsung tablets over the years and for the price, you can't go wrong with this one. I upgraded from the S2 9.7"" to the Tab A. The Tab A is thicker and a little heavier than the S2, but the screen is just as good even though the resolution is not as high. Beautiful screen, actually. The Tab A is fast too. Might be faster than the S2, maybe not, but it sure seems that way. The only 'con' I would give it would be the format of the tablet itself. It is easier to use it vertically (like a phone) than it is horizontally. By 'easier' I mean that it's easier to type and it seems that most of the apps out there are designed with the phone format in mind so they work best in that format. All in all, this is a premium tablet from Samsung and I would recommend it to anyone."

B01EUC7NPI,138,1380,Great tablet for my son,Mark,4,Yes,18-Sep-16,14,1,"I bought this for my son to replace an iPad 2 that served us well but it was showing signs of age with the battery and the hardware slowing down the OS and software (plus bonus I finally got my son off of the last Apple product in our house, though now we're still calling it an iPad, working on that).

Since this was for a kid, I explored tablets and considered the Amazon Fire tablets. In regards to the kids fire tablets, they were just to low powered (spec wise, resolution wise) and required use of their Android implementation called Fire OS. It felt like a throw-away tablet, something I'd have to replace in another year. They don't have expandable storage either, which is a problem because we use this as a movie center on trips (YouTube Kids offline mode, movies, apps, games, operating system) and the low storage without the option for an expandable SD slot makes you play app/storage juggle to try to fit large media on your small internal storage.

So, sure 16GB with this tablet but pop in a SD card up to 256GB and you're fine, and those are pretty cheap these days.

Ultimately I wanted the freedom on Android with expandable storage and explored the mid-range level of tablets. To note, the A Tab 10.1 is a mid-range tablet, giving you higher resolution and specs than the E-series, but not as high resolution and specs as you might find on the S2-series.

Going from a 1000MHz dual-core 512MB tablet to a 5-core 1600MHz 2GB tablet, to a tablet that has 768x1024 pixels (132ppi) to one with 1200x1920 pixels (224 ppi) also makes a significant difference. Since almost every game and app he was playing on his iPad was available on Google's Play Store

For example Minecraft PE runs 10x better, loads quicker, much higher FPS, etc. Same with Angry Birds, Plants vs. Zombies. While the iPad had it, we now have better casting support via YouTube Kids, Netflix (Netflix kids UI on Android is much nicer). Anyway you get the idea. Those people going from a tablet 1-2 years old might not be as impressed or see as significant improvement as we do.

The only reason I was reluctant to give it 5 stars is the Samsung TouchWiz (do they still call it that?) OS modifications they make. I will say this, it's much improved since the earlier days, it feels more out of the way, more integrated and it has ditched a lot of the older looking UI elements. So far it hasn't been intrusive so I'm optimistic.

Now, my 5 year old son doesn't care about any of this, so if my son was writing this review it's a 5-star review. Maybe I'll come back and give it 5-stars in another month of use after I see how well the OS handles, if we get Android 7.0, etc."

B01EUC7NPI,139,1390,"Great upgrade from my Note 10.1, better than the Tab S3 at this price point!",HarryClarke1889,5,Yes,17-Apr-17,6,0,"Excellent tablet! The price is truly competitive, the device is sleek and built very well. It also comes bundled with Samsung's EMR S Pen that slots into the tablet so you'll never be without this handy tool.

I own a 9.7 iPad Pro, a Note 10.1 2014 and briefly had a Tab S3 to see if Samsung's newest was worth the upgrade from my Note. It wasn't. The speakers sounded terrible compared to the iPad, the S Pen had noticeable input latency and the fact that there was nowhere to store the new S Pen were all deciding factors in why I immediately returned that device. I couldn't justify the price for all of the tablet's shortcomings.

I was still searching for a worthy upgrade from my Note 10.1 as the device had begun to noticeably slow down with my drawing apps, and I believe that this Tab A 10.1 is the answer. To be fair, there is a bit of input latency with the S Pen, but I can justify it at this price point and it really doesn't detract from the user experience. Accuracy is dead on, the display has much better black levels than my Note and the overall experience of using the tablet feels like a welcome upgrade.

The speaker placement is a bit strange and naturally doesn't envelope the user like the note 10.1 or iPad Pro. They do get loud and are not too tinny, which is good and at the end of the day, they serve their purpose and are usable.

One last thing which I miss from my older Note is the ability to swipe in multi window from the right side of the screen. This was a really cool feature, and if anyone reading this knows how to enable it on this tablet, please let me know!

In conclusion, I would absolutely recommend this to someone looking for an excellent tablet to create art with and enjoy media. Priced against the iPad Pro and Samsung's own Tab S3, this one is a no brainer. Get it!"

B01EUC7NPI,143,1428,"Good tablet, Bad Case - made my tablet randomly shut down!",woodNfish,4,Yes,06-Apr-17,21,0,"This is a good tablet. I bought it to replace my Note 8 which died and I wanted the S Pen. This tablet has a larger screen and better resolution than my Note 8 had and cost a little less. I like Samsungs because they are well made have more sensors and features than ipads, come with the pen, and will take extra memory. The extra memory is a killer for ipads. I will never buy one of their crippled products.

WARNING! Many people who have bought this tablet have complained that it randomly shuts off. Mine was doing that too. I was going to return it but I discovered it was not my tablet, but the cover (KuGi Galaxy Tab A 10.1 with S pen case) that has a magnetic clasp in it. The magnet was affecting my tablet. After I removed my tablet from the case it works just fine. I never had this problem with a similar case I bought for my Note 8 so this was a surprise. But if your tablet is shutting down on you and you have it in a case with a magnetic closure, take it out of the case and see if the problem goes away."

B01EUC7NPI,145,1444,Great Tablet!!!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,06-Aug-16,10,1,"Bought the tablet A 10.1"" over the S2 just for the fact that I couldn't see myself spending an extra $125 for some minor upgrades and a smaller screen. Being in construction this is perfect for what I need to document job site work and great for meetings. Clash of clans runs great and Facebook is very easy to scroll through and write post. The battery is long lasting but does take a while to charge. I'm assuming this is to keep the battery heat down which will help increase the battery life. Not a con in my opinion. Quality wise; it's got a very solid feel. The back I'm assuming is plastic but let's be honest. Most of us will buy a case to protect this tablet, so unless you're a stickler on that sort of thing it's nothing to cause you to change your mind. Anyways this is a great Tablet and worth the money. I don't see many bad reviews on this product but the ones that are there. Don't let them scare you away as I'm very satisfied with my purchase and I think you will be too."

I also personally prefer horizontal design over vertical.

B01EUC7NPI,150,1492,Not too bad,Merle,4,Yes,12-Feb-17,-,0,"I have had a Lenovo 10"" for 3 years and made the mistake of letting it upgrade the o.s. and now it does not function fully so I decided to buy the galaxy tab a 10"" due to good reviews and a good price of 220 bucks. So far I am liking it and would have given a 5 star but I have a broiler with it not accepting my emtec micro SD cards. I have both a 32 and 64 gig and it won't format the 64, says it's Corrupt. It formats the 32 but then says it's corrupt. Both of these cards work on my laptop so I know they are good. Also it has a smaller screen than my 10.1 "" Lenovo, it's 1/4"" shorter and narrower. Screen resolution is nice however. I have a smart Samsung TV and the Smart View does not do a very good job of connecting to it. I got it to work once but has been iffy since. I think they need to do some more work on that app. Over all I'm happy with it at $220 but not at $289 regular price."

B01EUC7NPI,155,1543,Great tablet for the price,cheltea,5,Yes,13-Feb-18,-,0,"I am actually really impressed by this tablet. I bought it solely for the purpose of digital drawing, and this machine suffices my need. I use medibang for drawing, and it has palm rejection settings. Works pretty nicely except when it sometimes zooms out when my palm touches, but thats probably app software side thing. I haven't noticed the tablet getting hot or anything while drawing for hours. S pen is thin but long enough to not cause strains on my wrist. If your hands are big, then you might want to think of investing on bamboo stylus.

Be warned though, the charger charges very slow if you don't shove into usb port all the way in. I mean all the way. You may need to literally push it in a little more after inserting. This was never problem with my iPhones, so I was a little nervous when I saw it charges super slowly, but because the fix was so easy (not necessary obvious though), I'd say I'm very happy with the product."

The battery life typically last me about a week. I use it mainly to ready off files a couple of times a week, and YouTube a few hours a week. While it's not being used it stays on without being touched. Through idle time, youtube, news and pdf files the battery life is awesome. It does seems a bit heavy, but I don't think the intention was for someone to hold it for hours at a time. Smooth swipe actions and system runs flawlessly.

B01EUC7NPI,164,1633,Disappointing....,Christopher Thomas,3,Yes,19-Nov-16,21,2,"I previously had a Samsung Galaxy tab 4, and was looking for an upgrade. I liked the idea of one with a pen for note taking. I absolutely fell in love with the Microsoft surface pro, but couldn't swallow the price tag. I finally ran across the Tab A and saw the were coming out with a model with the stylus and with all the reviews stating the stylus worked amazingly, I went ahead and pulled the trigger.

I've had it for almost a month now, and I have to say I'm disappointed. Compared to the Galaxy tab 4, it's a moderate upgrade at best. A lot of the features I came to rely on with my previous samsung are not here. It does not have an Infrared blaster like my old tablet, so I can't run my TV like I used to. It doesn't have a magnetic sensor, so it won't shut off automatically when I close the case. I downloaded a third party app and created a rule so that it uses the light sensor to turn it off when I shut the lid, but now the tablet will turn off if I accidently move my hand over the sensor, or when someone turns the light off in the room.

The tablet is noticeably thicker and substantially heavier then my Tab 4. Technically it has a better resolution slightly more ram and a faster processor, but honestly in my daily use, it's not a noticeable upgrade for any of those aspects.

The layout is a bit strange. It's a 10.1 inch screen like my Tab 4, but it's stretched out longer, which makes watching movies a little odd. Along those lines, the home, back and multi window button are now on the short edge. This sort of works when working in landscape mode since the buttons are then easily accessible with your thumbs. However when typing in landscape, you really have to stretch your thumbs to hit all of the keys. The most frustrating is when you stretch and accidently brush against the menu button while typing (which has happened to me several times while writing this review!)

When using it in portrait mode which is optimal when taking notes, the home, menu and back buttons are in the way. I found myself accidently hitting the back button with my palm when taking notes with the stylus, which would close me out of the note in the middle of writing. I finally turned the tablet upside down when taking notes so that the buttons were then on top of the device, and out of my way. The problem then became the light sensor being down at the bottom which again resulted in the screen sometimes turning off while taking notes due to me accidently moving my hand too close to the sensor. I currently am using Microsoft Onenote for note taking. It's great that for the most part, the S-pen feature is smart enough to not register my palm resting on the screen when I'm taking a note. I do notice however that if my palm touches the very bottom of the screen, it pops up the keyboard, which is also very frustrating. I wish I could disable that when the stylus is out, or move the trigger point somewhere else on the screen. I do like the fact that the S-pen is smart enough to make my lines thicker/thinner based on the pressure I use. However the pen is a bit thin, and I find the button on the pen utterly useless. In fact, many times I find myself accidently pressing it while note taking, which simply brings up the shortcut menu for the S-pen apps. This seems pointless to me since the link to the same shortcut button is always visible on the screen once you pull the Spen out. So really all it does is interrupt my note taking.

The smart stay feature is worthless on this device. It doesn't seem to work at all in landscape, since the camera is now pointed at your hand and not your eyes. Even in in portrait, it seems to randomly work, and randomly shut the display off in the middle of reading.

I'm getting to the point now where I'm starting to realize Samsung is just overpriced for what you get. There are many other tablets out there with the same specs or better for much cheaper. The only thing this tablet has going for it is the S-pen. So my advice on this really depends on what you're looking for, and what your budget is:

1. If you're like me and really want a functioning stylus that recognizes pressure input, and allows you to use it effectively while resting your palm on the screen, but you're not willing to pay big bucks for the feature, then go with this tablet. It's not perfect, but it will work.

2. If you want an amazing stylus experience, and you're willing to swallow the $800 price tag, go for the Surface Pro.

3. If you just want a decent tablet, and not so much interested with a stylus, skip the Tab A all together. I would even recommend extending your search to other brands. Samsung has always been pricy, but they used to also back that up with exciting, innovative features. It seems the rest of the competition has caught up, and can now delivery the same features and more, at a much lower price."

Upon handling for the first time, I love the feel. This is a well built tablet, that has the exact same feel as my note 4 phone, only a 10.1"" giant. Performance is smooth, and I've been using it to play games and other misc setup, browsing, ect. for about 2 hours and only killed about 10% of it's battery. That's impressive, we'll see if that lasts past 100 charge cycles."
B01EUC7NPI,173,1727,OK,Craig,2,Yes,27-Dec-16,1,0,"Not bad for the price and it does have a Windows layout so I'm able to have multiple tabs, which is something my IPAD and IPhone have never been capable of providing even though the IPAD cost 4 times more and the IPhone 6 Plus was 5 times more. Spending less seemed better since my IPAD memory can not be expanded and the IOS was purposely made out-of-date and then better than an IPhone that was defective but placed on the market anyway.

Bad connection system to recharge. Because of this it no longer charges."

B01EUC7NPI,176,1752,So-so screen resolution keeps this product from being a standout,Charles Green,3,Yes,30-Jan-17,5,0,"This review is for the Samsung Galaxy Tab A with S Pen 10.1""; 2016 version (I noticed several reviews on here are NOT for this product. Why, Amazon WHY?). I am coming from a 2012 Galaxy Note 8 which also has an S-Pen. Though the screen resolution is supposedly better on this tablet than my Note 8, I am not noticing it (perhaps because the screen is 10"" instead of 8""). If kept on auto brightness, it's pretty darn dim, too. The S-Pen is much more tactile than the Note 8's. That and the size of the tablet makes it much easier to take notes with. And though a larger tablet, it's slimness makes it easier to carry around as I frequently do (the MoKo Slim Folding Cover Case, available from Amazon, with it's rough surface also helps with gripping it). Slightly heavier than my Note 8, but I really don't notice it. The positives: smooth, fast operation and the battery last DAYS! I've had it for two weeks now and I've only charged it once (I usually have it on at least 8 hours a day; that includes occasional YouTube watching but mainly surfing the net, checking email, and using the tablet to stream music/video onto chromecast). I was fortunate to get this product on Amazon at $243, so for that price, this is a decent buy. Any higher and I would have waited for the Galaxy S3 and Google Pixel tablets, and used a Wacom pen."

While I love both, hands down wish I would have bought the one with the pen from the start. There's so much function that it adds like being able to write on the screen, more precise drawing capabilities, and notes. I also like to use it to give my fingers a rest.

The camera is definitely not as good as my Galaxy S5 phone and it definitely needs a memory card as it doesn't really have a lot of space. The big screen and graphics are wonderful. I prefer it over my phone and computer for almost everything."

I have all my etextbooks on the kindle app, all my notes on the samsung notes app, all my papers on the Microsoft word app. The split screen functionality is especially usueful with the large screen."

But if you want a 10"" tablet with a decent screen average performance and is a bit bulky, buy this one. But keep in mind those other improvements are gonna cost you. This one was only $199 on Amazon. So this to me is very affordable. I have an Asus ZenPad. (Out for repair. I dropped it) It's got a better screen. It's faster. 25% thinner. And it cost $150 more."

It is very reflective so you may need to keep it out of bright areas with lights and the sun so they don't show in the screen.

This was purchased for my business for one of my Techs to start useing the next business day. Opened the product, packaging was as suspected. Charged the device and then turned it on to start setting it up over the weekend so Monday I could have it to my Tech. I am unable to use the device because someone else has already set up their Google account on it. So now unless I have their password I can't even get into it to factory reset it properly. Obviously this was a returned item that was then turned around and sold as new. Mis representation toits fullest!

It was slow, but more than that, it quit working in that I could not connect it to wi-fi, after only 6 weeks of ownership. Sent it back to Samsung for service, they sent it back after about 2 weeks saying it was fixed with a letter of replaced parts. Still had the exact same problem, got permission to send it back again. It showed up again 2 weeks later with everything I had loaded on the tablet in the way of apps still there. Samsung had sent it back to me without ever having checked it out, because the service dept. always does a factory reset before they work on anything. (they always have to ask your permission to do so ahead of time). I was ""upset"" to say the least. Another phone call and they said send it back. After 2 more weeks, we got an email from Samsung saying it had ""multiple issues"" that could not be repaired and was entitled to another tablet or a refund. Needless to say, we wanted a refund. THEN, the problem with Samsung customer service started. After getting approved for the refund verbally over the phone with customer service, we received an email for us to justify our request for a refund. They already had the tablet, knew the problem, and approved the refund. We were MADE to start the process all over again. To shorten this nightmare of customer service from Samsung, we made about 5 phone calls, got reference #'s for each time, and finally after 2 months, got our refund. Samsung customer service is awful. Never again will we buy anything Samsung !!!!!"

Now the reason for me that its only 3 stars instead of 5 or 4 even... The charger.
First of all, the cable is really short and stiff upon opening. Then when I plug it in this pops up. ""Youre in slow mode, please use the cable and charger that comes with the device.""

The pen is really handy and offers much more precision than fingers on the touchscreen. I'll often use it even if I'm just scrolling through webpages. The built-in handwriting recognition functionality isn't perfect, but it's pretty impressive, and it allows handwriting input in most places that would normally require typed input. The S Pen is also nice for drawing in art apps. The split-screen functionality that can show two different apps on different parts of the screen is quite handy--when drawing on the tablet, I was able to have a photo reference open on one half of the screen while drawing in the other."

Everything else about this tablet is amazing. the pen offers great accuracy in writing.
I use this for school at UC Davis to take notes, as someone majoring in Biology, and minoring in math, taking accurate notes is of the upmost importance. I let my girlfriend use the tablet a few times, and she was so impressed that she bought herself one, along with a keyboard, and flap cover combination thingy and completely replaced her macbook. All she brings to school now is her tablet.

The note taking software from samsung that comes installed in the tablet is amazing. I have also used the microsoft surface pro, and taking notes is more comfortable on this tablet. I also occasionally watch movies on it. Would buy again. The cameras are awful though."

B01EUC7NPI,196,1951,Big disappointment,TJB_MD,2,Yes,25-Nov-17,4,0,"I wanted to upgrade my old IPad 2 to a better tablet as Apple doesn’t support any updates for my old tablet. I was looking for a device with expandable memory, so that and the price ruled out staying with Apple Ipads. The obvious choice was a Microsoft Surface Notebook but again the cost was prohibitive for me. I did a lot of research and found the Samsung Tab A 10.1” tablet. It offered expandable memory via an optional SD card and you can access memory sticks (devices) up to 2 Tb, according to the ads and reviews. I purchased a Samsung 128 GB Micro SD card and the USB dongle to access an external drive. All set to go but couldn’t see how I could default to SD card for storage for new apps, data, etc. Ultimately, I found out you can’t because Samsung removed this feature. You can move some (10%) of your apps one by one and you can change your camera default storage to the SD card but that is it. A big waste of money for both the tablet and the accessories. I haven’t tried the external USB data drive yet but the documentation says it will only handle a max of 32 GB. Very disappointed with Samsung in general. Don’t buy this tablet if you are looking for expandability like me."

I was not aware there were so many people getting duds, until I noticed mine constantly crashing and rebooting from day 1. This went on for about a week until I decided to look into it further. Amazon sent me a new one and this one works like a CHAMP!!!! I love it. Just do not understand how there clearly is a bad batch out there. Good luck to all that buy. I think it may be like a 50/50 shot you get a good one, but it is well worth it for the price and features."
B01EUC7NPI,196,1959,GREAT PRODUCT EASY TO USE,Leah,5,Yes,08-Sep-16,-,0,"Love the Samsung T580. I decided to try it because a friend had one. The only thing that irritated me was that the price dropped $28 just a few days after I bought it, and usually stores will refund payment if less than 30 days. Mine was 10 days or less. I will still recommend the product because it is great. I had a desk top HP for years, and then I got the same brand laptop when I could no longer sit at a desk.

This Samsung is perfect for what I wanted it for, and it is a breeze to use. Thank you."

I did go with the newer model that boasts a slightly different / larger screen. I was always pleased with the things I could accomplish with my Tab A.

B01EUC7NPI,201,2001,Solid all around tablet,Amazon Customer,4,Yes,06-Dec-16,1,0,"Overall a very good tablet, although a bit on the bulky side by today's standards. I find that the writing experience with the S-pen is noticeably improved relative to the Galaxy Note 10. 1 (2014) model, even though that one is nominally a higher-end tablet. The screen resolution is also fine, even though the pixel count does not reach that of the Note 10.1 (2014). The battery life is excellent.
Two things to note: (1) One cannot only project this tablet wirelessly to a screen; no projection is possible through a cable. (2) The S-pen buttons cannot be reprogrammed at this point to work with your favourite drawing app. The button will start Air Command, no matter what one tries to do to disable it. This is broadly reported to be an unsolved issue under the current version of Android.
Altogether, I'm very happy with this tablet; it does what it promises to do."

There is a difference between the work I do on my desktop with a drawing tablet and on the Tab A, but overall I can do good work that doesn't scream ""was done on a lesser device."" The S Pen is convenient, but the size does make your hand cramp if you use it for a long time. If you use screen dimming apps, you're going to have to disable them every time you grant an app permission, though, which is annoying."

Got the same one back from them repaired, never was offered a hot swap unit to switch with the defective one, even though it was less than 3 months old.

First what I like - screen is very sharp and great size for movies and working on documents. It is extremely fast and responsive!!! The battery seems to last a long time and it charges fairly quickly with the supplied charger. I like the USB port on the top. What I was a little annoyed at was the memory size/inability to add more with the SD card as an extension. You can use the SD card for certain things but Samsung seems to have deliberately disabled the ability to extend the system memory into the SD card - had I known this I would have looked for a 32GB tablet. The other annoying thing for me is the permanent placement of the back/see all pressure sensitive areas on the bottom edge of the tablet. I like to use it in bed and it is too heavy to hold for an extended period so I rest it on my tummy. I don't have six pack abs so my flab is always sending me someplace where I don't want to be."

The down side is the bloatware on it. There are way too many apps that you can't uninstall that should be removable. Samsung for Kids!!?? The tablet has 16GB of internal storage, but the BS software takes a good half of that, not counting the actual Android OS.
Whether or not this is an Android flaw or a Samsung design flub, even though you can install an SD card for more storage, the tablet might or might not allow the app and app data to be stored on the card. I have 3 aviation apps installed on the tablet, and even though I can seemingly select to use the SD card in the app config, it doesn't always stay on the card. Very quirky. Now, if you just want to store videos and other files on the card, it will probably work fine. I just wish the OS would be more cooperative.
Even with the app crap, (hey, that rhymes!), it's still a great tablet for the money."

B01EUC7NPI,204,2036,Superb Hardware - marred by the software.,Louis,4,Yes,31-Oct-16,106,13,"Hardware wise, this tablet is unmatched as far as I know for this price point. The closest contender is the iPad Air 2, or perhaps even the Nvidia shield - both of which pale in comparison to the productivity and ease of use of the S Pen. The iPad Air may be lighter, and it may have a better screen, but it is outmatched in terms of processing power, price and ease of use (S Pen). The Shield is mostly intended for gaming - perhaps not the best choice for someone looking for a productivity and light-graphics tablet.

I wish I could give this tablet a 5. Despite its overall excellent design, screen (which is crisp, bright and colorful), and battery life (I nearly got 3 days out of it before having to recharge), the sheer amount of bloatware is an incredible irritant. Microsoft Office I can understand - Samsung Kids I can tolerate. But Samsung's inclusion of over 6 GB of bloatware (mostly in the form of Texture, CNN for Samsung, a plethora of microsoft and google apps) is intolerable. And to make it worse, it is all 100% uninstallable. Expect 9 GB of usable storage out of the box ( and that may be generous, considering caching will slowly eat up the rest of the room).

Samsung made, in my eyes, a good choice in dodging the 'adoptable storage bullet'- what appears as an appealing option to overcome the low internal storage is really just a major hit to performance. Their resistance to allowing users to uninstall the bloatware, however, has been somewhat of a nuisance.

Do not get me wrong - the pros of this gorgeous product outweigh the cons by a landslide. I don't think I could even recommend another tablet for this price point without misleading you. Ideally, wait until the root patch comes out, and then remove the irremovable bloatware - and pick up a launcher from the Play Store while you're at it, because Samsung's default is, much like the bloatware, made with good intentions but somehow incredibly annoying.

Samsung Notes plays wonderfully with the S Pen, and the inclusion of Office has been very useful - the rest of the software, however, can go."

If it is brand new, it should not be asking for a password in order to unlock it or for any other reasons. When called, Samsung couldn't resolve the issue and said to contact Google. Google said the tablet would have to be sent to them and will need a new mother board.

B01EUC7NPI,205,2048,Very nice tablet!,A You,4,Yes,05-Nov-16,10,3,"Very powerful tablet! Would have given it 5 stars but not sure about aspect ratio and or dimensions of product. If you use the tablet in landscape mode, there isn't much height which can be a little bothersome when trying to view web pages or draw. I wish Samsung had just enlarged their 9.7"" tablet to 10.1 or just gave the 9.7"" tablet better resolution. This might not be a deal breaker for some, and I am not sure if it is, or isn't, for me yet.

All that aside this is a very nice tablet. Very bright display, great S Pen integration though I would also get the Wacom Bamboo Smart Stylus for Samsung Galaxy Note (CS310UK) if you want to draw. It works and feels great on the screen and is the size of a normal pen. Just remember to remove the S Pen from it's cradle, or the Wacom pen won't work. Having an iPad Pro, this works just as well. Many apps come pre-installed, too many actually, so you will probably remove some. That also brings me to only having 16Gb of storage - quite ridiculous (and another reason for only 4 stars). So, I also purchased a 32GB micro sd card so storage should not be a problem now. Just wish there was a 32Gb version. Another downside, and it's not the tablets fault, is the apps. There are simply much better apps for the iPad. If the same apps existed for Android, many more would switch over for sure. Well that, and this tablet is about half the price of the iPad Pro 9.7!

Coming from an iPad Pro like I mentioned earlier, this tablet just seems geared towards being productive and not just playing around. Not that I am not able to be productive with iPad Pro, but the S Pen integration and the Marshmallow operating system, seem to really make it seamless and enhance productivity. Just my initial thoughts. It sure would be nice if Windows 10 was like this!

Lastly, for those who have the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition, this seems like the predecessor to it. Should you upgrade? Yes definitely. Why? Marshmallow operating system, better screen, more battery life, and a little lighter (if that matters)."

It keeps saying it is not connected properly to a charger but no matter what I connect it to it fails to charge or takes hours to reach a full charge. The service desk told me to hold down two keys for 30 seconds to reset the battery but after multiple tries that only worked once and then the problem started again in a day. This is the second time I have purchased this tablet. I had the same problem with the first one, but I had used it for well over a year so I figured it was just worn out. Now I know it is the tablet itself."

B01EUC7NPI,209,2084,Not worth upgrading from Note 2014 10.1 to Tab A with S-Pen,qq,2,Yes,26-Feb-17,17,1,"This tablet is mediocre and not worth the money except the S-Pen. However the unit I have has a huge area of the screen where spen pressure drops (%20 of the left side in portrait mode) drastically so there are quality control issues with it as well. This is different than usual pressure issues around the very edge of the screens.

The tablet is snappy and fast enough but in reality this tablet is slower than my 2014 Note 10.1 which is epic sad because Samsung came up with a notebook tablet that is slower than a tablet it produced 3 years ago. Well if the app you use utilizes multicore to death it might be faster but the cpu clock speed is lower on this tablet.

I tested with many drawing apps and this tablet was slower in most drawing apps except Artflow. However Artflow is generally faster with Exynos cpus anyways.

I will return this unit due to lack of speed improvement and faulty screen.

After setting it up again it proceeded to randomly turn off during use, one time causing me to lose the word document I was working on. After 2 weeks it shut off completely (at full charge) and wouldn't turn on. After Samsung finally decided to take it back for repair (in which they required me to pay for the box myself as they wouldn't take the original box) it was returned a week later with the same random shut-off issue and the added bonus of not accepting software updates and prompting me to contact a service center.

The screen was one of the main reasons I bought this tablet for him. Bright, colorful, and can't see any pixels. It is also faster, lighter, and smaller than my old Lenovo s6000-f (also a 10-inch), which I got some years back for the same price. The Tab-A 10.1's capacitive button placement is awkward; there is a tendency to accidentally poke them while holding them in landscape.

As for the device , it came with marshmallow OS out of the box so got exact same UI as my phone.I am glad Samsung did not include lot of boatware on the tablet.It is really easy to disable any inbuilt apps that are not used frequently.

The tablet comes with only 16 GB onboard storage , but with the expansion slot for micro SD card it is not an issue.The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because Samsung decided to disable the functionality of using the micro SD card as internal (adoptive) storage. However with a quick Google search my tablet now treats the micro SD card as internal storage making things easier.
Overall the built quality is very good and the tablet even though slightly heavy has a full HD screen and decent speakers.Great for reading and playing casual games.Battery should last couple of days with normal usage."

It's not like I'm new to tablets. This is forth we have owned and none of the others, one of which is Samsung Nexus tablet has given me this much of a problem setting it up.

This tablet arrived quickly and as described. I use it just for gaming. I wanted to get all my gaming apps off my phone and onto a bigger screen. This was just the ticket. No dead pixels. If you have used Galaxy android devices before, this will be very familiar to you. The battery life is certainly adequate for my needs. I play games for an hour or so, then back on the charger it goes. A product I'm happy with, at a price point I could live with.

Update: Oh man... 1 month later I realize this tablet is garbage! For whatever reason, Samsung disabled the ability to move your apps to SD storage! Oh, sure, you can move your photos and videos to SD. You can also move your app DATA to SD. But the apps themselves? Nope. So that 16G internal storage the tablet comes with? Thats all you get. And be advised, the tablet comes with all the bloat-ware that all devices are infested with, so that 16G storage is really more like 10G. Internet videos say there ARE workarounds for this problem, but it looks like you have to know how to root your device, and be comfortable with that level of techy screwing around. So if thats not you, you might want to rethink the Tab A. Nice job, Samsung... What a stupid thing to do!"

Not really, but it lasts through hours of video chatting, Netflix, and anything else draining. I facetimed with my sister for about 3 hours or so and only lost about 20% battery life.

The warranty on this device is a year. Mine lost its display, for no apparent reason, after 9 months. Try calling the number for warranty service BEFORE you buy this and see what being jerked around really means."

Great battery conservation
Great battery usage

B01EUC7NPI,214,2140,It just stopped working,KDG,3,Yes,04-Dec-16,1,1,We bought this tablet 4 months ago for our teenage grandson who lives with us. It just stopped working. Don't know what to do with it. He was happy with it while it worked.

B01EUC7NPI,215,2142,Good tablet but not sure where it's from,Tony C.,3,Yes,25-Jan-17,2,0,Great tablet but after 5 months my screen began flashing apps. I contacted Samsung support they told me it was under warranty and I sent it in. 4 days later I got an email saying it wasn't manufactured in the United States so it isn't covered and that it was being sent back to me unrepaired.
B01EUC7NPI,215,2143,I would have given this tablet a five but I ...,W. Ballard,4,Yes,28-Jul-17,-,0,"I would have given this tablet a five but I found out recently that it is wifi ""only"" meaning that you cannot go to a Sprint or Verizon store and have it activated because it does not have a slot for a sim card only an sd storage compartment. Would not have purchased it had I known that because I had wanted to upgrade from my Galaxytab 8 and wanted a larger screen on my sprint network. Learned my lesson."
B01EUC7NPI,215,2144,I love my new tablet,ERIC D. THOMPSON,5,Yes,28-Jul-18,1,0,"I love my new tablet, but dammit I paid $227 for this thing last week and I just found out Amazon dropped the price $38. My timing skills so suck, but it is an awesome tablet. One star here in the writing because of missing the price drop. Just pay attention to the actual stars above. I just have hindsight issues."
B01EUC7NPI,215,2145,Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 Awesome tablet!!! Just what I wanted!,Chris,5,Yes,09-Jan-17,2,0,"Picture is great and clear. Video and game playback is clear. Sound quality is pre-set to a ""safe"" range....is a little annoying changing it each time a video/game is opened. Not a big flaw though so no stars removed. Response from the touchscreen is great....very sensitive. Great tablet for a $200 Black Friday deal."
B01EUC7NPI,215,2146,It's ok,Jonathan,4,Yes,16-Jan-17,1,0,"Like it no problems so far....BUT, It's true the screen resolution for movies good enough but noticeably different.

B01EUC7NPI,215,2147,Perfect tablet for a college student,Sierra,5,Yes,13-Dec-16,33,0,"Perfect tablet for a college student. Inexpensive, powerful, and fast enough for my basic needs. The S pen makes this worth every penny. No lag time writing with it, the very fine .5mm tip and the palm rejection software means I can write just as I would on paper without having to deal with bulky bubble styluses or writing with my hand lifted up off the tablet. I use this to store all my notes in one place and use it just about every day. Overall a good pick for a pretty inexpensive tablet for a productivity device."

I had to send it into Samsung for repair in November 2016 because it would not load up-just a black-blank screen. I received it back in about 10days and it worked good for bout 5 to 7 days and did the same thing so I had to sent it back to Samsung for the second time. I have always used Samsung phones but I'm to impressed with the Samsung Galaxy Tab.. I wouldn't buy another one."

Not a happy person!!
B01EUC7NPI,216,2154,Fantastic.,Citizen K.,5,Yes,23-Feb-17,-,0,"Wow, this is a great tablet. Works very well.. smooth and quick. Even the speakers are clear/loud. Coming from a couple of lesser brands, since I mainly use my PC and phone, this is a nice surprise. Great quality and overall performance. I should have bought this much sooner."
B01EUC7NPI,216,2155,Piece of Junk,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,08-Dec-16,7,0,"Shoddy engineering by a shoddy company... within a WEEK of purchase, used only for light reading an in a case, the screen wouldn't display anything. Of course, I ended up repairing it myself, and in a month the same issue happened, over and over. Sick of sinking time and money into this product. This might just be a dud, but I will stick to consistent quality products from now on...

Don't be fooled by the nice price, you'll end up wasting your cash regardless... The low price is consistent with the low quality."
B01EUC7NPI,216,2156,"Nice tablet, amazing price!",Amazon Customer,5,Yes,19-Feb-17,-,0,Have been using this tab for a couple of weeks & it's doing everything I need it to do. Light weight & easy to handle. With an added micro SD card there's plenty of storage. Samsung delivers a lot for a very small price. Happy with this purchase.
B01EUC7NPI,216,2157,"Good tablet, great value",Brian Gott,4,Yes,04-Jan-17,1,0,I bought this because I once owned the 8 inch tab with a pen and I loved it. This tablet is a little thick but I love the s pen. The resolution and battery life are great and you can't beat the price.

B01EUC7NPI,216,2159,Lighting fast,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,27-Aug-16,-,0,"My new tablet works extremely well. It is light and fast.
The one thing that makes it much better is expandable memory. The additional cost of a sd card is worthwhile. You can most of your information on the card."
B01EUC7NPI,216,2160,But it's been a great tablet so far and I love using it for ...,Jacksons,5,Yes,04-Sep-16,1,1,I was a little nervous buying this since so few reviews were available online. But it's been a great tablet so far and I love using it for streaming movies and reading eBooks. It's also got some decent graphics chops for games. The battery is a little weaker than I wanted. It gives me roughly five or six hours of on screen time. But I have no other complaints. The build quality is really solid. I like the 10.1 inch screen.
B01EUC7NPI,217,2161,Excellent tablet.,PJ,5,Yes,20-Feb-17,4,0,"My first android device I received as a Christmas gift and loving it. Everything I put on it runs great, it isn't ""locked down"" or full of useless pre-installed apps like most other tablets, and the battery life is fantastic. Also being this is my first android I needed a little support from time to time and Samsung was excellent in their options and communication including live support with remote access to show you exactly how to do things. Would highly recommend."
B01EUC7NPI,217,2162,Great for the price,Louis Morda,3,Yes,05-Dec-16,1,0,"It's a 10 inch tablet, which is great for the price. But yeah if you can afford it, definitely recommend something better."

B01EUC7NPI,218,2171,$200 paperweight,Changed Later,1,Yes,26-May-18,1,0,"It only worked for 2 months.

I contacted amazon to get it repaired or replaced and they sent me to Samsung. Samsung told me to take it to a Samsung rep at best buy to get it fixed. The Samsung rep told me they couldn't help me because I didn't buy it in the store.

Total waste of money."
B01EUC7NPI,218,2172,"I got this because it got good reviews, what a disappointment",Cheryl Szpilzinger,2,Yes,27-Jun-17,2,0,"I got this because it got good reviews, what a disappointment. The photo editor crashes and I have to restart and the battery charge doesn't last for more than 12 hours even when I barely use it."
B01EUC7NPI,218,2173,Sent a previously-used tablet!! What?!? Replacement doesn't work either...,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,26-Nov-16,27,4,"12/6/16 update: Am I the only one having problems?!? Replacement finally in stock (New, sold by Amazon, fulfilled by Amazon.) Re-ordered and got it on time. I opened the box and wall charger and cord didn't have the usual thin plastic protectors on them indicating brand new. Hmmm. Tried to turn it on but no luck. Ok, I thought, just charge it (even though all other brand new Samsung items always came with some charge. Plugged it in, nothing,,,,except the flash lighting for the camera came on when it was on the charger. No sign of absorbing charge (probably because the flash stays on...) And then it started to get hot. Yikes. Will return and never ever buy electronics through Amazon again. Samsung products are usually great so not sure why this is fishy with two tablets through Amazon. Argh.

11/26/2016 review:
Package arrived on time, opened it, looked like brand new packaging. Turned tablet on: another user account was present! Couldn't sign in as it had her password. Factory reset wouldn't work due to security reasons. Not a happy camper."

I have already recommended it to many.
Your price, even with the conversion rate was far better than anywhere off and online that I had searched."
B01EUC7NPI,218,2176,Shaky wifi...,JOHN REHNER,3,Yes,28-Aug-16,2,0,"Nice but wifi drops out quite a bit.
I have an older Samsung tab, and it very rarely drops out."
B01EUC7NPI,218,2177,Galaxy Tab A - Fantastic!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,05-Mar-17,-,0,I absolutely love my Galaxy Tab A. The battery lasts for over 15 hours with continual use. I have used other tablets over the years but this one beats them all. The response is really fast. You can not go wrong buying this tablet.
B01EUC7NPI,218,2178,Excellent,Aligator,5,Yes,27-Sep-17,-,0,Wonderful. Love they stylus. If your going to get this pad definately upgrade with the pen if you have kids. Nothing keeps them quieter for an hour. Love.

My beloved Nexus 10 is getting tired in its old age, and I wanted a follow on. There are not a lot of 10 inch Android tablets out there. The screen on this tablet is slightly lower resolution than the Nexus 10, and I was worried I might not like it, but really the screen looks just as good to me as the N10 -- thanks be. Perhaps not as great as a $700 tablet, but great for its price point.."
B01EUC7NPI,218,2180,I absolutely love it! I can't see that well,natalie ann poe,4,Yes,18-Sep-17,-,0,"I absolutely love it! I can't see that well, I'm legally blind so I count on my tablet to do A lot for me! I use the camera to take pics of things to enlarge so I can see it and the camera on this tab is awesome! And the features to enlarge all the fonts on this tab is so much better than my last!"
B01EUC7NPI,219,2181,Two Stars,G Di Nola,2,Yes,07-Aug-17,1,0,"Older version of the tablet, heavier than an iPad."

B01EUC7NPI,219,2183,Good tablet-- far too much bloatware,Wayfinder,3,Yes,13-Dec-16,49,7,"I would give this 5 stars were it not for the incredible amount of BLOATWARE that comes with this tablet-- programs that I don't need and can't get rid of. I am single; I certainly don't need Samsung for Kids. I also don't use or need most of the other software Samsung has deemed so essential they don't let the customer make that decision for themselves.

Other than that, the tablet works like greased lightning. Super fast. I don't like the physical home button rather than a simple capacitive home button. The screen is sharp and responsive. It lacks some features (such as an HDMI out, radio or phone circuitry), but it doesn't advertise such. For a mid-priced 10"" tablet it works great. But that Samsung ""we say so"" bloatware is a royal pain that takes up far too much system RAM."
B01EUC7NPI,219,2184,Tablet has excellent quality but service and warranty department don't seem to ...,Roberto Salinas,2,Yes,16-Apr-17,2,0,"Had a software problem, sent it back to Samsung, it's been two months already and not able to resolve it. Tablet has excellent quality but service and warranty department don't seem to coordinate their customer service."
B01EUC7NPI,219,2185,Corrupts SD card data,Nick L,1,Yes,08-Jul-18,1,0,"This device can't handle a custom partition table on an SD card. I inserted a card partitioned half exfat and half ext4. On the first boot, my SM-P580 allowed me to mount the exfat filesystem and reported a separate ""corrupted"" SD card filesystem. On reboot, it reported none. I tried to use the card in my PC and nothing happened. When I inspected the partition table on the card, I found that it was deleted. The only device that could have done that is the SM-P580. I had to repartition and reformat, wiping the data.

The inability to mount ext4 in any form denies the user the ability to have full permission-controlled storage on the SD Card. Separately, the device has adoptable storage disabled, so you can't overcome the limitation of the 16 GB internal storage. Many apps are packaged, including most Google and Microsoft apps, so you're stuck keeping all of those and all their data on internal storage. The packaged apps cannot be moved to SD card even in developer mode, and even for their data or updates. That means the tablet is basically a brick, because if you have any reasonable amount of data in Google or Microsoft apps those will exceed the storage capacity."
B01EUC7NPI,219,2186,This device works well but it turns itself off any ...,MARK L GERSZEWSKI,4,Yes,02-Nov-16,2,0,This device works well but it turns itself off any time it isn't used for more than an hour. Haven't found any solutions online. It's a long start up process after it turns itself off.

I finally broke down and bought one after all my kids and grandlings each have one, right down to the 2 year old. I do wish I had ordered the one with the 32 GB hard drive though. I use a lot of apps and I tend to fill up the drive fast. I did put in a 64 gb micro sd card though. Problem is, not all of the apps will transfer to the sd card. I should have realized that before I bought it. I have a Samsung smart phone and my tablet is just like a giant phone. I can do a lot more stuff on it though because I can see what's on the screen much better."

Will not longer recognize my Irig UA device. Plus it takes forever to charge. I can connect to the charger with 60% left and leave it connected overnight. When I look at it in the morning, it is usually at 92%. I then have to remove the cable and reconnect and after about 20 minutes it might complete the final charging. I wish Samsung made tablets that performed as well as their phones. This is my second Samsung tablet - purchased the S2 and started having problems with that one with the screen and then with holding the charge. It may have just died yesterday. Working okay - just finished recording on it and then it went dark and I can't get it to do anything. These Samsung tablets have all the right ingredients for a good piece of hardware but somehow the final outcome is no where near as nice of a build as the phones (owned S2, S4 and now S7)."

The tablet updated all 18 apps in a few hours overnight. The OS was also updated. Now, I still have to wait dowloading and istalling Amazon app in more than 2.3 min (600 MB). I checked my internet connections, my speed, my 1 year old, updated router... What else should a consumer do more.

So, no, i am disatisfied. 2 stars for shiny glass. It.s a waste of time returning things.

I purchased the 128gb evo select sd card to go along with this tablet because there is only 16gb of space inside. The 1920x1200 screen is beautiful and bright with accurate colors. I mostly use my tablet with apps like Autodesk Skethbook, Artflow, INKredible and I'm very surprised at how accurate the s pen is over my old Note tablet.

B01EUC7NPI,224,2239,the program Samsung is using on this tablet to replace S Note is horribly limited.,K Peck,3,Yes,04-Jan-17,8,0,"I had the Galaxy Note 8.0 previously along with their S Pen and S Note program. While the S Pen is indeed included, the program Samsung is using on this tablet to replace S Note is horribly limited...almost like a ""lite"" version...you can create categories (aka folders), but not sub folders. Pen colors and ability to save pen configurations are limited, ability to create covers for your books is not there, paper/page templates pretty much gone...and on and on. I don't understand how they could release this tablet and included such a bad version of S Note, especially for those of us who worked with previous versions. S Note is such an important program for me (and use of S Pen) that I am only giving review 3 stars...with hopes Samsung will update this app. I am considering moving to MS OneNote as a replacement, but the S Pen is a little sluggish using this program on the tablet.

The tablet itself I must say is very good, much more responsive then my Note 8.0 (but it was getting a little dated anyway)"

B01EUC7NPI,225,2246,OK For Hardcore Android Fans,CrotchetyOldCynic,3,Yes,31-Mar-17,5,0,"I bought it specifically because of the S Pen. I have several other mid-priced Android tablets that I'm fairly pleased with (Fire 8 HD is really pretty good) but wanted to try one that was designed and built for pen support. Yes, there are apps that allow you to scribble notes and even do some drawing on ""non-pen based"" tablets but nothing that's a big improvement over pencil and paper.

I also own (at the moment) an iPad Air 2 and an iPad Mini 4. The Air 2 is my reliable, EDC tablet and the Mini 4 is the dedicated flight controller to a pair of DJI Phantom drones. My only objection to the iPads, of any flavor, is Apples refusal to permit adding memory through the use of micro SD cards. If it were not for that I never would have tried an Android tablet.

The Galaxy Tab A is significantly better than the other Androids I've tried. Add the S Pen to that and it's terrific. I especially like the ""real"" home button, and the two other dedicated virtual buttons that are always there and I don't need to swipe to see. The S Pen functionality is excellent. I find it quicker to scribble a search argument into Firefox with the stylus than to type it. So far it has gotten it exactly correct every time. The ability to write a note without even unlocking the screen is also great.

The only complaint I have about the S Pen is ""The S Pen"". It's adequate for some things but it is very small to use as a writing implement for any period of time. I bought the Wacom Bamboo Smart Stylus (Model CS-310U) which thus far has worked perfectly and at least delays writers cramp. I do wish they had placed the button somewhere else - very easy to press accidentally. It can't be stored in the tablet so folks on the go will need to keep track of one more thing.

From a price viewpoint one has to really, really want the S Pen. The MSRP for the new Apple iPad is $329 vs $348 for the Tab A with pen. The iPad has a significantly better screen, faster processor, fingerprint sensor (amazing how quickly one gets accustomed to that) and it's thinner and lighter. It also ""fills in"" for my iPhone if it's at the other end of the house. I can answer a call with the iPad if I'm on the deck and my phone's in the bedroom. But the iPad doesn't have a pen. The iPad Pro can be had with a pen but starts at $698. Complicated life.

I don't believe the Tab A will become part of my Every Day Carry gear so it's most likely destined to move on to someone who will hopefully love it more. It does let me make notes, draw diagrams, etc. but so does my trusty Moleskine Cahier. I'll stick with my iPad and iPhone and on a regular basis curse Apple for not adding an SD slot."

The battery life is even better! Everything I needed to do, whether it was watching media, checking up on job schedules, or even setting up miscellaneous things like photos was a cake walk that took nearly seconds instead of hours! Totally worth it and I never thought I would even purchase a tablet in my entire life that's for certain. I might even buy an even better one to see how much an improvement things have gotten!

It's big, i can type on it, it's perfect for what i wanted it for (writing). I'd be happy to give it 5 stars but for one glaring oversight. You cannot lock, disble, or otherwise control the guest user account (which has free access to all the files on your sd card, too). This means that if my children get ahold of this device they have total, free, and unfettered access to the internet with zero parental overwight or control.
Yes, i could root it (voids warranty), or disallow access on my router (which works until the neighbor has open wifi, or the kids take the device to a friend'S house), but I should not have to go to such lengths.
So, if you totally don't mind that your device is entirely unsecured (or dont want to use it for a business), by all means, by this tablet. It rocks. If you have kids though, go find something else."

Also, the screen is dim, and too reflective. If you want to watch a movie in low light, the screen acts like a mirror and all you can see is your face. As strange as it sounds with these complaints, I like the tablet, everything else is great. You just have to get used to its shortcomings. It is fast, and provided apps make it easy to move downloaded apps to the SD card (32 GB included!). Its screen ratio is perfect for movie watching, no black bars like on my 4:3 ratio iPad Mini 4.

I would buy again and recommend."

Screen looks great and CPU performance is fast. 16GB in memory might be a hindrance for you since only about half is available for use and although there is a mini SDHC card slot Android and App developers make it awful hard to fully utilize the card instead of the internal memory.

I got one awhile ago and then my boyfriend was jealous so he got one for himself too. I've had mine for 2 years and I have a toddler that uses it daily and roughly.... My two year old stands on it, drools on it, gets everything sticky you can imagine on it.... and it still works like the day I bought it. It's fast, the screen is reactive and TOUGH.

B01EUC7NPI,235,2349,there are better choices for the money,Matthew D. Snyder,2,Yes,01-Aug-17,1,0,"Although overall it is a decent tablet, there are better choices for the money. The only people who should buy this tablet are people who badly want the pen, and can't afford any alternatives.

This tablet gets mostly decent marks for just about everything for its price range. It has a nice display, fairly fast, and has a pen included. However, this tablet is just too thick and heavy. It is really a bummer to try and hold this in your hand and your arm gets tired. Its actually bulkier than the Galaxy Tab A 10.1 without the pen. Its rather strange that it is so bulky. Also, the pen just doesn't feel good in your hand.

You can get an Ipad for about this same price now. The Asus 3S 9.7 is actually cheaper while being a better overall tablet. Like I said, there is no decent pens in this price range for competitors, so that is really the only reason to purchase this model."

Also, the storage is a major issue, you can't move a lot of the apps to the SD card, so being able to install a 128 GB card doesn't help at all."

Unfortunately, the item didn't shop with a stylus as advertised. Be careful about that. Unfortunately, as it was purchased for the stylus and didn't come with one a huge function of the tablet is lost and Amazon doesn't appear to sell replacement pens. Hopefully, we can find one. As my daughter is extremely disappointed that she can't use it the way it was intended, the review is low."

I tried every conceivable option to get it to work, including go to the settings in the movie and selected SD card for storage, reformatting the SD card, and even doing a complete wipe and reset of the tablet. The tablet also crashes if you attempt to store an app on the SD card. If you can live with 16GB of storage, it is a great tablet. If you planned on using the SD expansion capability, YOU SHOULD PASS, and buy something else."

Q. Can it make me lose weight?
A. No.

Q. Can it make me happy?
A. YES

3 Reasons why I love this Tablet:
1) 10 inch screen. Borderline beautiful resolution for watching videos , great for watching plex and sling
2) Battery life, Literally lasts me the whole day doing almost everything from Gaming to making assignments and studying.
3) Powerful Processor, (i can do split screen multitasking yayyy). Have not yet experienced any slow downs on anything from gaming to watching videos.

TLDR: This tablet should be destroyed because it will take over your LIFEEEEE. 10/10 would buy again!"

Of the four defective units I have tried to set up, all would turn all the way off while in mid task. This happened time and time again. Also on two of the four, we were forced to reset to factory defaults after the tablet decided that some sort of critical error occurred. Meanwhile, after one week of fairly heany use, my first tablet continues to work flawlessly. So if you believe in small samples, only 80% of the tablets are defective.

B01EUC7NPI,250,2495,this ain't no galaxy note 10.1 2014 update!,@youcantseeme,3,Yes,04-Nov-16,8,5,"This is NOT a premium tablet. When the lauded Samsung Galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition tablet was released, the concern was --isn't it dating itself by including 2014 in its name?--yes!

Sadly samsung never really opted for a true update of that tablet. Make no mistake--that was and probably still is a premium tablet in terms of style, screen type, and support.

So, years later, this tablet comes out. With only 16 gig of storage on board and 1920x1200 resolution screen, nothing about it screams premium. Despite have a 10.1 inch screen it is a portrait, not landscape orientation. The micro-usb port, along with the headphone port is oddly at the TOP of the tablet, not the bottom. Both speakers are at the bottom and not going to impress.

Still this has an hd resolution screen and a working screen with wacom digitizer support. It includes some of the software styling of the note series of phones, although not nearly as polished as the now-gone note 7.

I thought I was going to like it...but..I dunno. Its not heavy but its not light either, and as I said this is clearly aimed as a midrange rather than top of the line tablet. But it has a more modern CPU and a lower screen res, so it will carry on better moving forward than the note 2014 edition.

But is it a TRUE update? No, it is probably a way for samsung to dump the stylus from the note 7 in a new product. The size and shape are just weird, its not thin, and the screen resolution is a jump down from the 2014 note.

I have not had it long enough to determine battery life, but it should be decent. It had better be given its not ultra thin like the galaxy s2 note series.

So..I might keep or might return. Not sure yet.

Its insane in 2016 to release a tablet with only 16 gig of on board storage, maybe the biggest sign that while this is tablet with a wacom digitizer, it certainly is not meant as a premium replacement for the 2014 note tablet."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Galaxy Tab A is an excellent tablet, albeit with a few caveats. I bought this to replace an iPad Air, and all in all it's a very good replacement tablet.

The Good:
The screen is very nice and bright, crisp and sharp.
The physical home button is great (as opposed to a non-physical button that provides no tactile feedback).
The sound quality is much better than I'd expected. No complaints there.
Build quality and the ""fit and finish"" are all top-notch.
The touch screen is responsive and nice to work with.
The micro-SD card slot is a great way to bump up the storage capability.

The Bad:
No matter what you do, you CANNOT play a video with the cover closed or when you lock the screen. I've tried everything, and as far as I can tell it just can't be done. This is a huge disappointment, as it one one of the primary reasons I bought the tablet. I like to listen to Youtube videos as I'm doing other things, so I want to conserve the battery by blanking the screen or closing the cover...but no matter what I try it does not seem to be possible.
Closing the cover and still playing a video used to be possible on the iPads, but updates to IOS from Apple have removed this capability completely (and closing the cover kills Skype calls as well, WTF?). Even the iPad Youtube app won't let you do it now.
So, I figured it was time to move to an Android tablet, which SHOULD allow you to do this simple task, but even this brand-new Samsung can't/won't do it. Samsung customer service confirms that is no way to disable the ""smart cover"" function and that there is NO WAY to play a video with the cover closed, period. This is an Android problem and *not* something unique to Samsung tablets, but in the end, it's still a problem no matter who's responsible.
(And before you ask, yes, I've tried viewing the desktop version of the site, tried enabling all of the various options recommended online, tried all sorts of tricky stuff trying to fool it into playing with the cover closed or in lock-screen mode. IT. WON'T DO. IT.)

It's 2017- we can put a man on the Moon and put metal in a microwave, but we can't play a video with the cover closed?

The table is also a bit heavy, but not so much that it would be a problem.

I'm undecided as to whether to keep it or not- it's a nice tablet, no argument there, but it just doesn't do the ONE THING that I want to do. Very disappointing. I'll update this review if things change, but for such a nice tablet, this is a very disappointing problem."

Same with Google play. These Google things just won't load. I've hard reset this thing at least twice. Internet searches on this problem looks like a bad Google update in February causes the hangup.

SHORT REVIEW
It''s a decent mediocre tablet with an S-Pen at an ok price. Decent, but not ipad-level, screen resolution. Rectangular 1:6 aspect ratio good for youtubing/videos. Long battery life.

LONG REVIEW
I've long wanted a true pen enabled tablet. This is a bit of a budget form of that. Priced at this moment at $348, it still falls below the lowest ipad pro model at ($599) and ipad mini 4 ($499). The 1920x1200 resolution isn't terrible, but by today's standards, far from impressive. If I look at the screen from up close, 6 inches away, I'll still see jaggy pixels. If I look at the screen from resting arms length, about 12 inches, it begins to matter less. It's okay but disappointingly mediocre. Personally, I think any tablet resolution below ""retina display"" is embarrassingly outdated.

The pluses of this is that it does have an s-pen, the thin, precise pressure sensitive instrument for writing and drawing works without power and fits snugly in the tablet itself. I wanted it mostly for sketch drawings. It is a thinner than normal instrument to draw with but I feel okay with it. I like that it attaches in the tablet, shows you a hover cursor, needs no power. I've briefly tried the apple pencil, and while it seems to do it's job, and senses angled drawing, it still needs to be powered, costs $99 extra, doesn't attach to the ipad, doesn't show a hover cursor over the screen, has a thicker tip. Pluses and minuses on both sides, but Wacom based technology S-pen still is the best stylus winner to me.

The aspect ratio of the tab a with s pen is about 1:6, more rectangular, vs the ipad's more square 4:3. This may be another mark against the tab a, as I'd feel more comfortable in drawing and web browsing in 4:3. Though if you think about it artistically, 1:6 may be a better framing mindset for cinematic compositions. Whereas 4:3 feels more freeing to sketch on because you think less about drawing to fit either tall or wide. Watching videos, youtube, however, the Tab A's better. And it's not bad.

The capacitive touch buttons don't illuminate, small detail, but kind of annoying in the dark. I mostly hold this tablet horizontally and accidentally touching the captivate buttons does happen. Fortunately, there are third part apps that can disable the captivate touch buttons. I saw a tutorial recommending the app ""All in One Gestures"" to customize/disable the buttons, and ""Simple Control"" to add virtual replacement buttons. Adding these overlays will affect certain app installations so be aware you'll have to disable them temporarily when prompted with an overlay issue.

OS, you'll be getting android 6.0.1, Marshmallow. Not bad. Processor exynos 7870 octacore chip 14nm. I did notice the battery runs pretty good. I think it was rated at 14 hrs. Android OS certainly gives a person more freedom to customize but it's more complex to setup and dig into.

Other candidates I considered were the Galaxy note 10.1 (2014), Galaxy note 12.2, Ipad Pro 9.7, Ipad Pro 12.2, Surface Pro 4.
Why I didn't opt for the others, has to do with price and whether it's up to date.
Galaxy note 10.1 (2014) - Dated, but with great 2560 x 1600 screen, and priced used at ~$250 (passed cause dated OS, Processor by 3 years)
Galaxy note 12.2 - Dated, but with great 2560 x 1600 screen, and priced used at ~$450 (passed cause dated OS, Processor by 2 years)
Ipad Pro 9.7 - Great screen, but lowest $599+$99 pencil= ~2x tab a with s pen price - $700
Ipad Pro 12.2 - Great screen, but lowest $799+$99 pencil= ~2.5x tab a with s pen price - $900
Surface Pro 4 - Also great screen but lowest $899+$110= ~3x tab a with s pen price - $1009
The latter ipads and surface are about to undergo refresh cycles first have of next year.

Or just get a $350 mediocre tablet. Damn you, Samsung. I want my premium Galaxy Note 2016-2017 tablet (that doesn't explode)."

TERRIFIC and also the battery, if you enable the saving functions

I purchased this product from Amazon USA because, in Europe, and not 'sold,

shopping centers in my area is not 'available even ordering it, and' the
Samsung Galaxy Tab A P550 S-Pen 9.7-inch, but the screen resolution and '
of 1024 x 768 2016. The 'really low! This 'made me opt for the' SM-P580
with absolutely best resolution !!

But then why '3 stars? For 'Care Samsung Italy and why'
It not 'sold in Europe:

?Inizialmente wanted to purchase the Tab A P550 available in Europe, call Samsung for Italy

The tablet and 'very good, 5 Stars, if I HAD SAMSUNG ITALY

- I took off a star for the 'Support Samsung Italy for cases

Samsung should start to these problems as' soon.

I would then like to make a suggestion to Amazon USA:

Assist Telefonica or chat, in the language

The first one received took 48 hour to charge only 60%. We got the replacement promptly (even before they received our return), but the replacement ""usually"" stops charging for no apparent reason. We have to unplug it and replug the charger, and sometimes we have to do that 5-7 times before it will start charging again...that 5-7 tries is to get one ""session"" of charging to occur.

B01EUC7NPI,256,2558,STAY AWAY! Awful device and worse customer service from samsung!,PHB,1,Yes,24-Oct-16,52,6,"Great Tablet!!!

I love this tablet, at first I was worried. Over the years I have owned many tablets. This includes: Original Galaxy tab 7.0, galaxy tab 10.1, motorola xoom, galaxy tab a 9.7, nexus 9, ipad 2, ipad mini, ipad air 2, galaxy tab 2 7.0 and a few random branded tablets. I had the nexus 9, but didnt really use it after about a year. It had to many issues. It ran slow and crashed often. I also own a ipad air 2, which I use mostly at work. I ended up selling my nexus 9 and figured I would just use my ipad. I then missed having my android tablet. I looked around, originaly wanting to purchase a google pixel c tablet, but did not want to shell out the money. I read a few reviews on the tab A 10.1. It brought back memories of how much I loved the original galaxy tabs 7 and 10.1. I deicded to spring for the tab A 10.1 It was around $270 and that was a decent price. I was expecting to be a little dissapointed, but boy was I wrong. I really love this tablet. The screen is gorgeous, and it runs better then I imagined. It does how ever stutter if to many apps are open. I use the device mostly for web browsing, twitter, instagram, facebook ec. I also love watching videos on it. While the screen is not the highest resolution on the market, it is gorgeous! The soud quality is also pretty good. I really dont care about the camera, I dont use any of my tablets to take pictures. I only have a few issues with the device. The first is that I would love for it to have a finger print scanner. Its a small detail but it is a nice touch to have. The second being storage, the device has 16 gigs on board. Of course the operating system takes up some of that. Yes, there is a mirco sd card slot for expanding storage, however you cannot move enough items to it for my liking. All in all I really love this tablet. I would highly recommend it for people who want a decent tablet and dont want to shell out a bunch of money.

Update: The tablet became a brick! The device continued to shut its self down. I contacted samsung and they were no help. Do not buy this tablet... so disappointed

Update #2: After sending in my tablet for service, it was returned to me. They DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. I am livid! Seriously stay away from this tablet!"

B01EUC7NPI,257,2569,Buy this one for yourself. Let the kids have an iPoo for a toy.,Ravalli Surfer,5,-,09-Jun-17,3,0,"I bought this on impulse when I was out shopping for a new table saw. OK - I had to go across the street to find an electronics store.....

This tablet is a replacement for my totally destroyed Tab S 10.5 - which died a horrible and uninsured death!
(Hint: buy the insurance!!! Really!!!) Pfffft! to $500.00!

Anyway - I am not disenchanted by this tablet as it has some better and some equal and some less than the Tab S Samsung - but it really makes up for any deficiency by doing more things than the Tab S did.

First - it's the PEN! This is ultra kewl and I cannot imagine going to a non-pen type tablet ever again.

The weight is a little heavier than the Tab S - but I like that part since part of the death of the Tab S was because I didn't feel it's presence and it got --- well, enough of that.

Battery life is incredible.
Resolution is pretty good - but not as good as the Tab S
The Micro SD size limit is outta sight!
I'm going to try the animation (gifs) tomorrow when I have some time.
Surfing the net is fast and almost intuitive.
There isn't a lot of nagware or pre-installed crappola. Hooray for that!
I ordered a nuc-proof case for it AND I bought the insurance!
Charging time is very quick.
I transferred all my Google accounts from the suicidal Tab S to the Tab A with the built in application.
I don't miss the NFC like my Nexus had (OK - I am not going there again)
Get the fastest SD-Micro card you can. It's no good to have a HUGE SD card and it be slow for read/write. Make sure the R/W is at least 100.
Both the cameras are top-notch!
The funny little package of what looks like a badly designed tweezers and some tiny plastic nails - is a tool for changing the tips as they grow old, get chewed off or get dirty."
B01EUC7NPI,257,2570,Excellent Performing Tablet with a Bright and Clear Screen,Coyote,5,-,25-Nov-16,4,0,"Got this for my wife and it works great. We're new to Marshmallow and Samsungs' implementation so it took a bit to familiarize us with where some things reside, but it wasn't too difficult especially if you like spending a little time playing around with a new device. The screen is very clear and bright without over saturation. After downloading and setting everything up it is working great without any issues. One thing that is impressive is the battery life. After about 11 hours of use it was showing almost 30% remaining on the battery. A well known consumer magazine reported the battery life as 15.8 hours, though they didn't mention at what per cent the brightness for the screen was set at or if that was being connected to the Internet the whole time.

Have only had this for a week, but have been using it for several hours every day and have not encountered any lag or disconnects and the processor seems powerful enough. Considering that this was under $200 including a 32 GB card it is a very good buy, especially compared to what an iPad costs. The only unknown is whether it will last, and that has been a problem with a few other tablets we've had that they didn't last all that long, though none were made by Samsung. Hoping that this one defies that trend."
B01EUC7NPI,258,2571,"Fantastic for every day use. S pen is useful, but could use some design improvements",Joshua Senecal,4,-,15-Feb-17,3,0,"This is my first tablet. I would describe myself as a casual tablet user. I use it to maintain my calendar and to-do lists, use it for email and some web surfing, taking notes and working with documents on Google Drive, and occasionally watch stuff on YouTube. I have loaded a few apps I find useful. My use is not pushing the limits of the tablet’s processing power, battery life, or graphics capabilities. Overall I find it to be a great tablet for everyday use.The 10.1-inch screen is large and is 1080p-capable. Brightness and clarity are very good. There are two small speaker ports on the underside of the tablet. Their quality is good enough for basic use, but nothing outstanding.

The internal storage is 16 GB. That sounds like a lot, but the operating system and preinstalled apps (“bloatware”) take up almost half of it. If you’re the type that likes to load lots of apps and music, or take pictures and video, you may find that space will get tight rather quickly. Since memory cards are so cheap now there’s no reason not to get a card and move as much as you can to it.

The main attraction with this tablet compared to a “regular” 10 inch Android tablet is the S pen. The S pen is a somewhat flattened stylus with a button on one side, and works like a regular stylus with some additional functionality. You can use it to take notes, draw a sketch, or make annotations to whatever is displayed on your tablet's screen. The S pen also seems to fill a space somewhere between a stylus and a mouse. If the tip of the pen is in contact with the tablet’s screen it behaves just like a regular tablet stylus (or your finger) would: you use it to make selections and swipe. If you lift the pen from the tablet screen so it hovers about a half-inch above the screen, a blue circle will appear, indicating where the pen is pointing. In some cases when you hover the pen over something on the screen a text box will appear, indicating what that thing is or does. While the blue circle is visible if you click the button on the S pen the pen menu appears. Click the button again and the menu disappears.

For instance, if you have a web page in a foreign language loaded, bring up the pen menu and select “Translate”. Then hover the pen over a word, and its translation appears. Select “screen write” and it takes an image of what’s on the screen, allowing you to draw or make notes on it. You then have the option of saving the image. Select “note” and a virtual notepad appears, allowing you to take notes in handwriting. If you load Google's handwriting input ""keyboard"" the Pen makes writing much easier than with a finger or rubber-tip stylus.

The S pen glides smoothly and freely across the tablet’s screen. Be aware that if you install a screen protector on your tablet the S pen, while still very usable, may not glide over the protector as easily and smoothly as it does over the tablet’s native screen.

It’s comfortable to hold, but the button is in an awkward place. When I hold the S Pen in a way that feels good to me, the button is nowhere near any of my fingers. SO have to hold the pen further up, which isn’t as comfortable. I’d prefer it if the button were located on one of the narrow edges (so I can push it with my index finger) instead of on the side."

Because I travel a lot, I like the flexibility to download content to view offline.

B01EUC7NPI,258,2573,"Screen looks great and performs very well. Build feels cheap, so a decent case is strongly recommended",EdFromOhio,5,-,14-Dec-16,3,0,"Let me start off by saying that I'm a bit of a budget tablet junkie now. I've had a few Dragon Touch (cheap Chinese Android) tablets of various sizes, and I've had every Tab A tablet larger than 7"". The Chinese tablets tended to be unstable, freezing for 30-60 seconds at a time and apps crashing on a routine basis. After trying my first Tab A, I was hooked.

A dear older friend needed a tablet, so I gave her my Galaxy Tab A 9.7"". Since I needed another, the choice was either another 9.7 or the 10.1 because my eyes aren't what they used to be. Given that I'm writing a review on this one, you know which one I picked although I bought it from a membership-based big box store because they had them in stock a considerably better price at the time.

The screen is higher resolution than all the other Galaxy Tab A line offerings, and it does show in reading text and images. Not a lot, but it is noticeable. Color is very nice. Performance is perfect for me, as I don't buy these to play games. If games are your thing, then the S2 line is more your speed. Don't get me wrong, this can play most games very well. But the S2 is that extra edge you need for demanding games, and you just can't beat the AMOLED display. Wow, that S2 has a beautiful screen.

The downside - compared to all the other Galaxy Tab A tablets, this felt cheap. The others have a much nicer fit and finish to them. This felt a lot like the cheap Chinese tablets I grew to hate. There's no solid metal ring around the screen for protection and there's no solid back like the other Tab A's have. It's a cheap plastic back which wraps around to provide very little protection from damage to the edge of the screen. If you're not into using a case for protecting your tablet, you'll seriously want to rethink your position or consider a more durable tablet. That's my biggest complaint - the cheap feel and inadequate screen edge protection.

The above being said, I always use a tempered glass screen protector and a smart case which negate the lack of stock protection. With those additions in place, I'm very happy with how this tablet looks and performs.

Recommended accessories:
Tempered glass screen protector: [...]
Smart, slim case with several color/pattern options: [...]
Good microSDHC memory card if you need the extra storage:[...]
Meko Stylus:[...]
Overall - a highly recommended product. But keep in mind that you'll likely want at least a decent case to protect the screen."
B01EUC7NPI,258,2574,Upgraded From Nexus 9,Vincent,4,-,09-May-18,1,0,"Owned a Nexus 9 since launch and now it has screen freezing issues. Decided to buy this as a replacement. Let's go over features of the Galaxy Tab A and some differences compared to Nexus 9 along the way

First thing to notice is the larger screen. Comes in a 16x10 aspect ratio instead of 4x3; so it's either really tall or really wide which is good for watching videos or viewing web pages.

Bezels are really small in both landscape and portrait mode. In landscape mode, its very easy to press the capacitive buttons and cover up the speakers, and in portrait mode its easy to press the side of the screen (unless you palm the bottom of the tablet with one hand). Unless you're going to use for a short time span, it's ideal to use a stand in my opinion.

Picture quality is really good at 1080p. If you're used to seeing 4k all the time, you may see some pixelation, but generally overall good display.

Speakers are on the bottom of the tablet (portrait mode), instead of front facing on the Nexus 9 which is a bit disappointing especially when holding in horizontal mode, but sound quality is decent for a tablet. It lacks in bass, but loud enough for youtube videos. If you want to watch HD movies that are surround sound compatible, or listen to high quality music on it; best to get a Bluetooth speaker or hook up a wired speaker/use a headset via aux cable if you want more immersion

Has physical home and capacitive buttons which is very convenient vs onscreen buttons (on Nexus 9) as it doesn't take up screen real estate. Downside, as mentioned before, you may accidentally hit the capacitive buttons when holding in landscape mode.

Has 10gb internal memory (6gb used up for processing/system memory), but has expandable storage up to 256gb via micro USB card slot

Battery life is amazing! Can last up to 10-12 hours depending on what you do with it. Does not support rapid charge so it takes around 5 hours to get back up to 100% from 5-10% battery life. Idle time for the tablet is really good though and can last up to a week without it doing anything or do minor tasks like checking e-mail once in the morning/night.

App drawer lower right instead of bottom center which can take a bit of getting used to. You cannot change this unless you download a custom launcher

Run stock Android instead of custom one like in kindle devices, so all apps on the Google Play works on it. Runs Android 7.0 vs 7.1.1 on Nexus 9 (essentially the same). Galaxy Tab A does have custom software options like blue light filter mode and customized battery save mode.

Camera okay. If you are spoiled by high end flag ship smart phones than you may be disappointed and never use it. seeing how large the tablet is it's hard to get a good grip and hit the snap/record button anyway. But it's good for skype calls/video conferencing, and emergency photo shots/video recording. Can also be used as baby monitoring or security device if you have the app

No tap screen to wake like on Nexus 9, but can wake via home button in front. Have to tap power button to put to sleep or let it sleep on it's own

Apps run fine with 2GB RAM. Should not be your dedicated gaming tablet, but most games run fine, but may get some frame rate issues on games that that run over 30fps, But most games nowadays on the Play Store don't go that higher than 30pfs anyway

Build is decent with a hard plastic body. A little weighty, but feels sturdy.

Overall very good all around budget android 10inch tablet. If you want the basics of Android with exceptional battery life this is the tablet to get."
B01EUC7NPI,258,2575,Read the 1 Star reviews - 10% of people got a lemon from Samsung,Amazon Customer,1,-,13-Jun-17,8,0,"I bought my Samsung Galaxy Tab A tablet (SM-T580) in December. Shortly after setting up the device the tablet started randomly crashes. I'd be on my tablet just playing a game, or reading a book, and then my tablet would just turn off. When I turn it back on, it still show my battery percentage as being between 90-100%. I would be on it again for five minutes or so and it turns back off and it keeps repeating the process.
Sometimes, it first freezes and then reboots, or just shuts down, but sometimes it does not freeze, but reboots/shuts down suddenly.

I tried to wipe the cache from the recovery menu, no result.
I started the tablet in ""Safe Mode"" to see if the problem still happens. Sure enough, same issue!
I did a factory reset and then didn't install any apps, but the problem remained.
I have no SD card installed.
I have sent it in to a repair center 4 times now under warranty, and they still haven’t fixed it. Each time it takes almost 4 weeks to get the table back. Each time they say it is fixed. This time I didn’t even bother to install any apps. I turned it on, and after 10 minutes- SAME ISSUE! I don’t think they even tested it before they sent it back.

Worst customer service ever!

I call and have to explain the problem every time I call. Then they always transfer me- every time. Sometimes I get to talk to someone, but most of the time I’m just on hold until I give up!
They always act like “I” did something wrong when I call- like it’s somehow my fault the device is defective. In looking to find a way to fix the problem on my own, I’ve found hundreds of people with the same issue! Samsung refuses to acknowledge the problem (like no one else has ever reported the this issue). Give me a break! Take responsibility already, and give us a refund or replace the product!"

I felt compelled to give a clear review, though as a REGULAR amazon customer Who appreciates how it is when looking for insight on a product before buying.
In searching for information about this tablet, one frustration with these reviews is they were mixed together with the 8"" tablets...so In my heading I put which model I am referring to--to avoid the confusion I got....:-)

This tablet deserves a 5 star rating. Fast with an octa core processor and 2 gb ram and ANDROID MARSHMALLOW 6.01. Hoping for the update to Nougat...we will see.
Here is where I want to qualify why I gave it 4 stars:

If you want to hold this tablet...there ain't much room on either side of the screen to hold it in portrait mode...like when reading a book.....
In landscape mode you have some edge to hold but you have to contend with your thumb hitting the control button....ugggh that gets--watching a video and hitting the back button....or while reading....Apparently they designed it without testing it...nice slim design but wow...this plan was not thought out....have to spend 400.00 or more for that I guess with the tab s....

Right hear on amazon. Pro Case. Not leather but it makes it easy to hold and its a nice soft leather feel to it and comes with a stylus pen.
Awesome deal!!
Although this is not a s pen tablet, I found a note taking app on amazon Underground: NOTEPAD+...Its Free!! and it lets you write with a regular stylus....Not to bad...

The display is gorgeous and very clear. I am an Android user and this tablet has the feel of an Android phone which I like. Very user friendly and I love using the S Pen. I don't notice any delay when drawing with the S Pen. All the apps I use on my phone seem to be available for this tablet and the look great with a few exceptions like some banking apps but I can always just use their mobile wesbites. I included a photo so you can get an idea of the size of the tablet and pen, (sorry photo is kind of dark, it was early morning). If you are a casual user of technology you will love this tablet! It also has apps like Microsoft Word that I haven't tried but I am impressed it's even available. I use my tablet for social media, reading e-books, email, practicing music (I use the app Yousician where it creates lessons and you play along to learn) and viewing photos that I have saved online. This tablet is a major upgrade from my last one, a Gpad 7.0, so I love it! The front facing camera takes photos that are kind of pixelated but whatever and the regular camera on the back looks better and is pretty nice for a tablet camera. I love this thing very useful!"
B01EUC7NPI,258,2578,"This wonderful Tab A 10.1 Tablet was a gift to me, I love it. My detailed review.",Daisy S,5,-,04-Mar-17,2,0,"This Tab A 10.1 (2016) was a gift to me and I really have been enjoying it for so many reasons of the very generous screen, it has almost replaced my laptop! So I decided to review it.

PROS of Tab A 10.1:

1 Clear and bright screen with excellent colors. This tablet has a nice PPI (Pixels oer inch) at 224 PPI. So this makes tbe screen much clearer than the older Tab A 9.7 in my opinion. Very easy to read the screen when reading an ebook or in my Kindle app, easy viewing on the Internet, all is crisp and clear.

2 Adequate Internal Storage... Sixteen gigs of storage, however, after Samsung placed OS and apps, I started with about 11 gigs. I was able to install Facebook, Twitter, Kindle, and a quite a few more apps. I have about 6.3 gigs left for adding apps later.

3 WiFi is easy to setup and I receive 4 to 5 bars no matter where I am in my home. WiFi on this tablet has never dropped while using this tablet at home or other places.
The WiFi I find fast also.

4 Super Peppy and responsive...no lagging at all.

5 Very large clear screen, slim design, small bezel...thus Tablet is mostly screen, no wasted space! purse or bag. Screen to body ratio is 74.8 percent...excellent!

6 Camera is 8mp and has a flash. I took outdoor and indoor pictures. Both types super clear. I was happily surprised.

Do I recommend this larger tablet?
Yes, IF you want a large and easy to read tablet that has good internal storage.
No, if you want a smaller and easier to carry around tablet, but I still suggest this tablet as it is so trim and slim....I placed it in my purse easily."
B01EUC7NPI,258,2579,Quick Web Browsing,yeahOK,5,-,19-Oct-17,3,0,"I bought this from BB, but wanted to leave a review. After years of buying budget tablets and being disappointed with their speed, I paid a little more for this one and it has been perfect. Web pages load very quick which is my main use for this tablet. I like to browse the web while watching TV and this fits the bill with good battery life too. Very nice size also. Full size web pages look good and everything is sharp compared to the cheaper and smaller tablets I am used to. Compared to a budget tablet, this one can cost 100-150 more, but it's worth it in my book and I'm glad I splurged. Definitely one of the better tablets in this price range."
B01EUC7NPI,258,2580,Cool tablet,B. Salge,3,Yes,15-Sep-16,1,1,Great tablet but returned because broken wrist caused it to be too heavy.
B01EUC7NPI,259,2581,One Star,Vhangs,1,Yes,13-May-17,1,0,I gave this 1 star because the Audio doesnt work well
B01EUC7NPI,259,2582,Almost!,J. S. Johnson,3,-,19-Sep-17,1,0,"This really is a very nice tablet. Even though it has a 10.1"" screen it's narrower than the Galaxy Tab S3! The S Pen that comes with it is great and works really wall but this tab also works with the new S Pen that comes with the Tab S3 so WIN! The SD card slot is easy to get to without needing an ejector pin. And oddly enough, the top mounted charging port is surprisingly useful. It's easier to use while plugged in that way. Oh and this tablet is only $300! You get A LOT of tablet here for $300.

But there are some drawback that have me saying ""bye-bye"" to this tablet. #1 by a long shot is the weight. I know, I know...""it's a 10.1"" tablet, what do you expect?"" But it was between this and the S3 for me. This tablet is easier to hold in the palm of your hand but because of the extra 1/4lbs of mass, it's no more comfortable to hold than the wider, slipperier (is that a word?) S3. There's only 16GB internal and 3GB RAM. Pretty meager stats at this point in the game. And there's also no fingerprint scanner and no USB Type C. Seriously? This tablet was released in 2016 and no USB Type C? Sigh.

Great tablet and I highly recommend it if weight isn't an issue for you. But get the one ""with S Pen"". It's worth it!"
B01EUC7NPI,259,2583,Awesome tablet,Richard Salva,5,-,22-Jan-17,2,0,"Design question: I’m not sure why the camera lens on the back of this tablet is raised. By doing so they ensure that there will be more wear and tear at that point of the back of the tablet, where it is laid down, than at any other point. It’s a puzzle. I guess it’s a selling point for buying a protective case for it. Cool icon while charging lists the exact percentage of charge. A Quick Start Guide comes with it and highlights the key functions, the location of the S Pen and how to remove and use it, how to connect to Bluetooth, apps, etc. I’d say this tablet compares well with iPads for clarity of graphics/screen resolution and ease of usage and especially for battery durability. No problems setting up with the Internet or email. The S Pen is really cool and I like its functions, whether for drawing or for cropping or highlighting a segment of a photo or image. Comes with replacement tips for the S Pen and a tool for removing the used tips. The battery is supposed to be super long lasting, and it certainly seems to take a good while to drain a charge. It also has an app to help you move all your stuff from an old tablet to this one. I like the options to expand memory with an SDTM card and using Quick Connect to transfer a TV movie or show from a Smart TV to the tablet. With its versatility and mid-range size it can be used like a laptop or eReader, play games or watch movies, load apps and do your work on it. What’s not to like? Really, this is an awesome tablet. If you’re looking for an alternative to an iPad, I recommend this one."
B01EUC7NPI,259,2584,Where have you been all my life?,JesusIsLord,5,-,08-Aug-17,1,0,"One of the best purchases of my life!

I went to the Sprint store to add the Hotspot to my line because I do not have wifi in my home. They informed me it would be better for me to purchase a tablet and just pay about $30 more a month which would be about the same price if I added a Hotspot. So that's what I did and purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 inch and it has been EVERYTHING. It was between this tablet and an Ipad and I chose this one because it's setup just like my phone (Note 5) and operates on the android system so it was easier for me to get right into it. Things that I have setup on my phone was able to transfer over to my tablet through my gmail accout which was a selling point for me. I've had this tablet for over a week now and have used it for mostly everything so I'm going to try and do a thorough break down so you get a clear picture of why this is a 5 star review.

WIFI - I got the unlimited data plan so I can use my tablet the same way I would use my phone, just pick it up and go. I have had no problems with internet connection thus far. Wherever I go, this tablet goes and it has worked well in all settings I've been in (home, work, church. etc)

MOVIES - I have Amazon Prime and with that comes millions of free movies of which I never really took advantage of using, until now. I've watched 2 full movies, one in Prime and one I rented (in SD) and they played perfectly. Sound is also good, just don't expect a surround sound type of thing. No skipping, no blurriness, no interruptions.

MUSIC - I have tons of music and love the way it sounds on this tablet. My Prime music transferred right over which was very convenient. Speakers are great and the sound reaches a good level.

BOOKS - Great for reading books. Keep in my mind this is a 10.1 inch so its huge and it just makes for great reading. I read The Bible on here and love how everything is much larger.

INTERNET - I use the internet on my tablet more than on my phone now because it just seems more efficient. It has basically replaced my desktop. I've applied for jobs, changed my FB settings, manage accounts, etc. all with no problems. I do recommend the unlimited data plan, you won't have to worry about running out of gigs.

GAMES - Good for any games. I've played phase 10, Bible trivia, Word games, etc. on here and they are all great!

OVERALL - To be honest, there's no going wrong with this tablet. I hope I was able to help somebody who is considering purchasing one of these because I'm here to tell you, you will NOT be disappointed. I already own an Amazon Kindle Fire 8 inch and this does circles around it. So if you're thinking is this better than an Ipad...YES! You can do so much more on the Android system. Definitely worth every penny. Go get yours NOW!"

B01EUC7NPI,259,2587,Compares Well With iPad Air,takingadayoff,5,-,09-Jul-16,17,0,"I've been using an iPad Air for several years now, but have been looking for an android alternative, just so I'm not so dependent on one operating system. I've used android a little on smartphones, but am still much more comfortable with iOS. I am comparing the Galaxy Tab A 10.1 with the iPad Air (1st generation).

The first thing I noticed is that the Galaxy Tab is narrower than the iPads, 6.1"" vs. 6.6"". This made a huge difference to my small hands. I was able to hold the Tab comfortably even though it actually weighs a little bit more than the Air (Tab=1.2 lb., Air1=1 lb, Air2=.96 lb.). It's also a little taller than Air (10"" vs. 9.4""), which makes up for the loss of screen width while still remaining comfortable to hold.

The resolution looks good, but the specs indicate that iPad has a sharper resolution. I could not tell, but I use the tablet mostly for reading books and web surfing, so there may be a point at which more resolution simply won't be noticeable, at least by me.

The camera has front and back facing options and takes great photos, but again, this is not an area in which I am especially picky.

One plus for the Galaxy Tab is the microSD reader. This could come in handy for transferring photos or other data, or for stocking up on videos for a trip. In any case, being able to offload some high data files onto a card is a very handy option. In fact, it may be more than just handy since about a third of the available memory on the Tab is taken up by content already preloaded on the device.

So far I am quite satisfied with the Galaxy Tab A 10.1, it's as good as the iPad Air in most ways, seems to sip battery power more slowly, and is more comfortable to hold. Limited memory is offset by the microSD option, and the price for the 16GB wifi only model is lower than the comparable iPad Air2."

Original review-
I like the small size which is convenient, but when doing just basic browsing i frequently tap again thinking the tablet didn't register the first tap, only to have it finally stop lagging and then I'm someplace totally different than where i needed to be. I bought two of these and both are the same. In fact, even while just typing this review it freezes around every 10th keystroke or so which becomes maddening after a while. If im not checking each word then i often don't notice it skipped letters as it became laggy. These are ok for very basic browsing but i wish I had not purchased these."

1. There was a sound glitch that happened around 3 times within a week. A very loud static noise happened while my headphones were in. It was so loud that it actually hurt my ears. This has never happened with my headphones before, and happened on a few different apps. It hasn't happened since a few weeks ago.

2. The tablet didn't turn on recently! At this point I wanted to return the tablet but it was past 30 days. It's not MY fault that your product has issues that don't show up right away. I am very gentle with my electronics and yet I'm the one who has to pay for the defects, apparently. Anyway, I got it to turn on my pressing the power and volume down button.

3. The home and back button are easy to press on accident, which is annoying until you get used to it.

4. The speakers aren't very loud and are only on one side. It isn't a huge issue for me since I almost always use headphones.

Pros:

1. The screen is smooth to write/draw on. I don't experience any lag with the drawing app that I use (Medibang.)

2. The pen is a good size for my small hands/fingers. I also like that it can go into the tablet itself so I don't lose it.

3. The battery life is really good! I can be on it all day and not have to worry about charging it.

4. Price. I needed a tablet that I could draw with as well, and this is a LOT cheaper than apple products....-_-"
B01EUC7NPI,260,2593,"Excellent for art, great quality for the price.",LisaC,5,-,15-Dec-17,-,0,"As an Apple user, I was hesitant to get a Samsung tablet. I went for it because it's so much less expensive than the iPad pro with the pencil, and I'm so glad I did! I wasn't sure how the screen resolution would look in person as it was lower than some other tablets I read about, but it doesn't look pixelated at all. It's great for art and very realistic. For example, the colored pencil option gets darker the more shading you do, and when you ""paint"" with different colors they smear together just like real paint does if you mix multiple colors. You can rest your palm on the screen when drawing with the pen (unless you accidentally press a button) so it feels natural to use. Because of this natural positioning when I take notes on it, my handwriting looks as good or better compared to taking notes on paper. I like it as much as more expensive tablets I've tested. I

t's also very convenient that the pen doesn't require charging and isn't overly pricey to replace if you (or your kid) lose it. The user interface is intuitive. The battery lasts a long time, and there are lots of great apps available through Google. The option to add your own memory card saves a ton of money. I bought a 64 gig micro SD for only $19, whereas tablets that don't take a removable memory card charge way more for an upgrade in storage space. The card also makes it easier to transfer files between the tablet and a computer if you don't feel like using a cloud or emailing everything. The only downside to this tablet that I've experience so far, which I think may be why it is available at such a great price point, is that it feels a little bit thick compared to some devices nowadays. It's not overly heavy and still looks nice, but it just isn't super sleek."

It's OK for taking notes (get the stylus version) but moving OneNote files to a safer place (like PC and backup) involves jumping through hoops. It would have been easiest to be able to email OneNote pages to yourself, but you can't. The Microsoft Cloud has limited storage but is OK for the one thing at a time you are working on. Powerpoint would be a more stable and versatile platform in some ways but is installed with limited page formatting options (landscape only). OneNote has limited cut/copy/paste/save and drag/drop capabilities. I hope they improve the software. Also comes with Samsung Notes software. Will report back on that. OK. I'm back. The Samsung Notes app is terrific. Although the thick wedge pen is not so great, writing is easy. You can save your page to a retrievable, emailable file (for safekeeping). You can have two windows open at once so that stuff retrieved from the internet can be plopped into your Notes page. You can lasso things and they get saved to Gallery, from whence you can insert them into your page. You can print to a pdf file. So all this makes it great for class note taking or research.

I bought this device with the sole purpose of being able to digitally draw & paint while mobile and have yet to be able to enjoy that aspect since a precursor to my taking expensive electronics out into the public is to always travel well protected. Well, their are a ton of 'slim' 'folio' case options for this device but I dont find them to be particularly effective. My style of case preference has always been the Otterbox Defender series cases and I have pretty much purchased one for every tablet/phone device I have owned. While the Otterbox cases appear to be available in the 8.0 and 9.7 Tab A sizes, there are none at the moment for the 10.1 size. I keep hoping that they will make one or that at least some other company will make a comparable rugged case for the 10.1 Tab A WITH S PEN so that I can finally use this device the way I had intended but so far I really dont see any suitable options available. The little bit of drawing that I have done with it at home so far has been enjoyable but entirely gratuitous considering I have a fully equipped desktop workstation with all the latest software and peripherals. I really wanted to be able to get out of the house with this. Sigh, I even sold my Note 2014 edition with Otterbox case for this as an 'upgrade' but Im sorta missing it now. Anyway, I realize my review is mostly about the case rather then the device so take it for what its worth, its just something I do consider when purchasing something like this. -1 star for lack of case options."
B01EUC7NPI,260,2596,Great Tablet for a great price.,Joe,4,-,22-Aug-17,-,0,"I bought the tablet to replace my older Galaxy Note 8 as the battery was dying and I couldn't upgrade the software. I bought the tablet at Costco for a low price. I wasn't sure at first but after reading reviews here on Amazon and Youtube, I bought it.

The tablet is a little heavier than my Galaxy Note 8 and its a 10.1 inch vs an 8 inch. The screen is bright and big. It does get plenty of finger smudges but its easy to clean with a micro fiber cloth. I didn't get a screen protector unlike my last tablet. I haven't noticed any scratches since buying it a month ago.

The sound is low. I have to raise it to medium just to hear the music and voice. I hope Samsung will fix the problem.

My main problem is the micro card reader. I've never had a problem using my micro card with the Galaxy Tab Note 8. My mom bought the same tablet as mine and she has the same issue. The micro card reader fails after a few hours. I tried everything. Reformatting the card, rebooting the tablet and downloading apps that could fix it. All failed. So I decided to buy a micro card USB reader. Now my tablet can read everything on the card.

The tablet comes with only 16gb memory but its less because of software and apps. Use a micro sd card or duo USB drive to expand memory.

The tablet is fast and I've had no issues. The battery is big and last's a long time. Wished Samsung had offered a bigger USB recharger Vs the standard one you get. It takes a couple of hours to recharge to full. Glad the charging port is on top Vs bottom.

The tablet came with Android 7. I'm very happy that Samsung decided to upgrade the software. Hopefully Samsung will upgrade to 7.1 or 8.

This is a great tablet to own."

On a business trip i decided to go light, ""Hay"" i though ""I can leave my notebook at home because my Tab T580 can run the meeting."" I plug it in the night before, next morning it was dead as a brick. None of the local repair shops would even touch it. IPads, Kindle - yes Samsung tablet NO! Than God i had a backup on the SD card which I pulled and put into a brand new notebook i had to buy an hour before the meeting!"
B01EUC7NPI,260,2600,Best Tablet for this price range.,Stacey Joldersma,4,-,25-Jul-17,-,0,"This tablet has by far the best specs and features than any other tablet at this price range. I highly recommend it.

However, there is one thing that I wish were different. The tablet layout is in portrait mode which means the buttons are in the way when using it in landscape (I very rarely use it in portrait, so this is a big nuisance to me). I am constantly hitting the back button or the recent apps button when using the tablet. It happens so much, that I had to dock a star in my rating. The portrait layout also means that the speakers are on one side of the tablet when using it in landscape :( considering this is how most people watch videos, it is disappointing.

I don't want to end my review with that one complaint, so let me list some of my favorite features: split screen - love love love this capability and with 3gb of ram, this feature works flawlessly; user profiles - my son uses my tablet all of the time, so I like being able to control what apps he has access to, there are also ways to hid and lock files within your user profile, just in case you want extra protection; s pen - now I use s note and I had to side load this app because this tablet comes with the new note app (Samsung Note), but either app is awesome especially with the s pen, I use it to journal, jot down quick notes or lists, and Iove to use it for drawing too. There are many more features that I love, but this review would get too long.

To summarize, I love this tablet and have learned to overlook the one thing that I don't love about it. The price is well worth the loads of features you get for this brand name product!!"

Isn't the whole point of these things to fill them with media and take it with you everywhere? Then on occasion play that media on bigger screens? I'm so unhappy with my purchase. I wish I never bought this.

Last time I trust Samsung to make anything good."
B01EUC7NPI,261,2602,"Superb Tablet, Especially for Note-Taking and Reading!",squall-leonhart-8,5,-,23-Jul-17,-,0,"Prior to this tablet, I owned a Samsung Tab S. I mostly used my tablet for taking notes in college classes and for reading on, but I did play games every now and then on it (including Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, Modern Combat 5, Final Fantasy, Plague Inc., and The Amazing Spiderman 2). I tried a variety of different styluses (including regular rubber-tipped ones, small rubber-tipped ones, disc styluses like the Musemee Notier V2, and various active styluses from Adonit such as the Adonit Dash 2) with the Samsung Tab S for note-taking, but nothing worked quite as well as Samsung's S Pen I had tried in stores and was familiar with from my Samsung Note 3. Thus, I decided to upgrade to a Samsung tablet that came with the S Pen, and I settled on this one despite my worries about the processor and pixel resolution being a slight downgrade from my previous tablet.

I have now owned this tablet for about half a year and used it for notes through a semester of college. It is mostly designed as a productivity tablet for things like note-taking versus a performance tablet for things like gaming, and I can say that it definitely comes through on the note-taking part. The Samsung Tab A is a far better solution to note-taking than my old Samsung Tab S with even the Adonit Dash 2 was. The true palm rejection that the S Pen gives is a dream for note-taking. I have not noted any slowness or lagginess in this aspect. Also, while I do not play games often, I have tried playing Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and The Amazing Spiderman 2 (both pretty graphics-intensive games) on this tablet, and I have only noticed a small amount of lag with the games. However, it is not enough to be a great distraction or to ruin the games. I have also not noticed in everyday use the loss of pixel density compared to my own tablet - it is possible that it would be more noticeable if comparing side-by-side, but just using it on its own I have not noticed anything. I have watched a YouTube video of the old Tab A that showed it to be pretty laggy, but with this 2016 edition Samsung has significantly improved the specs. While the 2016 edition Tab A definitely does not have top-of-the-line specs, I have found it is easily enough to play games on sometimes and by far enough to do things like note-taking and reading without any lag.

Overall, if your main goal is to do things like take notes, read, or browse the internet, this tablet is a great choice. Especially for the $300 price point, it is hard to beat. Especially consider my primary purpose for using my tablet in the last few years has been to replace a pile of notebooks for school, I cannot recommend this tablet enough. If you want something that comes as close to the feel of pen-on-paper as possible for a great price point, this tablet is hard to beat. If you need more power and have extra money to spare, I imagine the new Tab S3, closer to $600 in price, would probably be what you want. However, I would definitely consider this tablet before get the S3, because for a savings of $300 or so you get a tablet that isn't much shabbier. The one upgrade I did make in the last few months is to get Tab S3 S Pen on its own for about $50 (it now seems to be closer to $40 - https://smile.amazon.com/Samsung-EJ-PT820BBEGUJ-Galaxy-Stylus-Black/dp/B06WD1GVM3/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1500830699&sr=8-3&keywords=samsung+s+pen). I greatly recommend this S Pen because it feels much more like an actual pen and not a twig like with what comes with the Tab A, plus many cases come with a holder for a stylus (I personally recommend Moko cases - https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MA1L49U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). You do have to remove the stock S Pen in order to use the Tab S3 S Pen with the Tab A, but I have found that you only need to pull it out a little ways instead of all the way. This lets me use the stock S Pen as similar to a button to turn the S Pen capability on and off, and then I don't need to worry about where to put it while I am writing with the Tab S3 S Pen. One warning if you are looking for S Pens: There is an ""S Pen with Eraser"" that I bought from eBay before the Tab S3 S Pen came out, and I ended up never using it because I preferred the stock S Pen to it. The S Pen with Eraser seemed to be slippier than the stock S Pen, and it also seemed to have fewer pressure levels. Thus, I would warn anyone looking for a replacement for the stock S Pen to avoid it. I highly recommend the new Tab S3 S Pen that just came out, or you could possibly try Wacom styluses, though I have no experience with those so cannot recommend them or warn against them.

Overall, this is a great tablet for productivity activities like note-taking, reading, and browsing the internet, and it can even hold its own on graphics-intensive games with just a small amount of lag. Though I was initially worried about the downgrades compared to my own tablet, they do not seem to be a problem and this tablet is perfect for what I use my tablet for. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
B01EUC7NPI,261,2603,SIX MONTHS OF USE AND STILL LOVING THIS TABLET!,Anne Withanee,5,-,04-Mar-18,-,0,"First off, I have owned, and used, this Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T580NZKAXAR 10.1 inch tablet for over six months now.

Admittedly I am far from a tablet expert but as one of your ""average Joe"" tablet users, I find this tablet awesome! First and foremost the battery life is extraordinary. On standby, the charge lasts for days on end and although I have never run the battery down completely, I find that it recharges very quickly. I find the response time fast and when switching it on it connects to my Wi-Fi in a blink of an eye. I have used this tablet for streaming video for six, seven, eight hours connected to an external bluetooth speaker and the battery lasts with plenty of power left to spare. I find the sound from the built-in speakers to be quite impressive on their own as well. The 10.1"" screen is a great size for streaming videos and the display is extremely crisp and vivid.

I really haven't experienced any problems with this tablet over the past six months and am very, very pleased with my purchase!"
B01EUC7NPI,261,2604,I picked this one up from costco for a good price and figured I would give a shot,LoveMyToys,5,-,19-Dec-16,1,0,"I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 as replacement for my iPad Air, which I accidentally dropped in the toilet (don't ask!). I didn't really want to spend another $600+ for an iPad (need at least 64gb), so I started looking for alternatives and wanted to stay in a budget. I picked this one up from costco for a good price and figured I would give a shot. I have always used android phones so, the switch from the iPad to the galaxy tab was not a big deal to me. The Galaxy does basically everything the iPad did for me and just as well. Although the screen isn't as sharp as the iPad on paper, the difference between 1080x1200 and 2560x1500 really isn't noticeable on a 10"" screen. You can't see the pixels on either without magnification. The colors look great on both and the wider screen 16:10 format on the samsung is better for watching movies than the 4:6 on the iPad. Battery life is very good--no noticeable difference from the iPad, but it does take longer to recharge. On the whole, it's a solid tablet for the money and I see no need to spend the extra money for an iPad--particularly if you're not married to the iPhone and apple ecosystem."
B01EUC7NPI,261,2605,Samsung disabled the Android's adoptable storage feature,Randolph Wang,3,-,18-Jan-18,2,0,"This tablet has some major short coming.

1. The three standard buttons are not software buttons, it is on the tablet itself. The big problem here is when you rotate your tablet to landscape mode these buttons are in a very strange position. I guess this is not limited to this tablet. My last tablet was a Amazon Fire and it had a software buttons and I never thought of this issue until I start using the Samsung.

2. The SD card, Samsung disabled the Android's adoptable storage feature. In other words you cannot ""extend"" your 16Gbyte internal storage. You can only use it like an 2nd hard drive. When you have enough apps that do not allow you to move on to an external sd card (which is the majority of Android apps) you are stuck."
B01EUC7NPI,261,2606,"Awesome tablet, unneccessily short on storage",Amazon Customer,4,-,05-Jan-17,-,0,"I mostly use my tablet to read/listen to books, web surf, manage household (calendar, memos, lists, grocery apps), take quick pictures (I don't currently have a smartphone), and stream video when traveling. I also have a few games I play in my down time (Monopoly, solitare, Phase 10, Trivia Crack).
The very first thing I noticed about the tablet is how nice it feels in your hand. It's light and balanced. The back is flat and smooth, if it weren't for the camera it would be completely flush.
The bezel is skimpy and before I had a case I was constantly, unintentionally activating the back button, pulling up the recent apps and swipping the screen. Speaking of cases the lack of acceptable ones is frustrating. I really would prefer an Otter Box (or similar) my last tablet took a fall. I ended up with a bulky EVA foam one marketed to kids. It's functional and comfortable but not really attractive.
This is not my first super skinny, giant smartphone shaped tablet. My last tablet was the same way and for the first few months I hated it, ugh. Now, I see the benefits, it's great for viewing media, and reading e-books and holding in my hands. I can even hold it in portrait mode and type with my two thumbs. I still don't love it for games but for most things I do it's fine.
Battery life is AMAZING. I used to have to charge my old tablet every night; this thing is a beast. I can charge it a few times a week and be fine. Of course it, does take time to charge because of this but I value battery life over fast charging.
It's speed is great and it never lags. I'm never waiting like I was with my last tablet.
The biggest flaw is the unbelievable lack of storage space/preloaded bloatware. My last tablet was 16GB and I had a 32GB card for photos and my tablet was 25% full. It came with Google apps, Walmart and Sam's Club apps, VUDU, an Adobe app or two and a word processing/office suite.
This Samsung Galaxy Tab comes with Google Apps, Samsung Apps, Microsoft Apps, CNN, Samsung Kids, Samsung Plus and something called Texture. As far as I can tell I can't get rid of any of it. I don't even have all of my apps from my old tablet yet and this new one is 75% full!
I would have never imagined that I would need to buy an SDcard and use that as primary storage but apparently that's in my future.
I don't know if my old tablet was Jellybean or KitKat but I know it was basic, not customized by the manufacturer. So, when things are different, I'm not sure how much Marshmallow or Samsung is to blame. I can tell you I LOVE the high-visability keyboard, but most of the rest of the little things annoy me. The folders on the home screen have impossibly tiny icons, rather than a slightly askew stack. (At least I found I can color code the folders but even color choice is very limited.) The large text accessibilty option doesn't make as much text large on screen as I had hoped. I have vision impairment and have been using a computer for more than 30-years, I've never had to use specialty screen readers, I could always get by just by changing the screen resolution and such but as far as I can tell I've activated all of my options and I am still having hard time reading the smallest text.
I've also downloaded Google clock rather than use the Samsung clock. I do like the Samsung calendar app, though. It's hit and miss with the basic stuff.
Overall, I still think it's a 4-star tablet and worth the price I paid (which was less than the MSRP/list price, yay open-box sale). I'm not familiar with tablets that aren't bargin priced to begin with so I can't say it's as good as or better than an iPad but I suspect it must be prety good. I am still very happy with my purchase, would do it again and would recomend this tablet to others looking for a mid-range large screen tablet that isn't so cheap it won't function it a year but it's so expensive it breaks the bank."
B01EUC7NPI,261,2607,Delighted with product,Grackal,5,-,01-May-17,-,0,"Tablet arrived on time and in excellent condition, as described. I was a little worried because this is the first sophisticated computer technology I've bought from Amazon. The small box containing the tablet arrived in a box with some plastic air pillows for cushioning, but this seems inadequate for this type of device since the small air pillows slip all to one side and allow the device inside a small box to bang around in the larger box. Need either a smaller box or better cushioning.

However, I'm delighted with the product, very pleased that it arrived safely, in new condition, and with all accessories promised. I was not expecting the several replacement S-pen tips, much appreciate these. The device was not difficult to set up. The basic initiation of use, registration, etc., is pretty straightforward. I was able to get my supplementary apps downloaded and installed without trouble. Pleasantly surprised to see the Microsoft Office software installed (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), which didn't expect. Resolution is excellent.

The S-pen is fantastic, been wanting one for years, and it's easy to figure out and put to use. I love that I now have the tools to create art with the tablet, anything from doodles to cartoons to 'painting'. I also love that I can use the S-pen to hand-write notes as an alternative to keyboarding. I'm glad Samsung moved the charger port to the side of the device instead of the bottom, this is an improvement in the product design.

Overall excellent purchasing experience, thank you!"
B01EUC7NPI,261,2608,Died in 53 weeks,senor mud,1,-,29-Aug-17,3,0,"I loved this unit for 53 weeks of light use (fabulous video) and it went dead. All kinds of you tube videos on how to fix it, so it is a common problem. You have to break it open. Apparently collects corrosion on the connectors inside, losing the ability to charge or draw power. I don't want to play doctor, I've got plenty of projects already. I didn't expect such low quality from Samsung. Too much $ for a one year product. . I bought one for my wife for Christmas, now we can't trust it either. Very disappointed"
B01EUC7NPI,261,2609,A Really Solid Budget Tablet,Eric DU,5,-,13-Jan-18,1,0,"Owned this tablet for less than a yea. Have been using it mainly for web surfing, video / audio streaming, and also light gaming. My verdict is it perfectly satisfies all my needs and is worth every penny.

Pros:
Nice performance. The Exynos 7870 + 2GB RAM combination packs some punch. It’s by no means a behemoth but provides more than enough processing power for everyday tasks. Never overheated.
Excellent battery life. The 7300mAh battery it comes with allows you to not need charging for a week or so if you spend ~2 hrs daily on tasks listed above, based on my experience. Lifesaver.
Smooth Android OS. Able to upgrade to 7.0. Monthly security updates avail.
The screen is crisp. It does not have vibrant colors compared to an IPS screen but still nice for viewing.
The plastic body is really sturdy.

Cons:
A tad heavy. If you get a stand this can be mitigated.
The navigation keys are sensitive and can easily be triggered by mistake, bringing you to the homepage / recent apps list. Had this happened to me on multiple occasions.
Some other glitches that might be platform- / OS-specific. e.g. with auto rotate off you still can change in-app orientation by rotating the device.
None of the cons are really a dealbreaker to me."
B01EUC7NPI,261,2610,I am glad I have a decent Android tablet to augment my ...,MJ,5,-,28-Dec-16,-,0,"I am still learning to use my Galaxy Tab A with S Pen, but so far I am liking it a lot..

I've figured out how to move apps from Internal Storage to SD card which was the big seller to me on this tablet. NOTE - some apps cannot be moved, such as those that are provided by Android or Samsung. Most apps I have downloaded can be moved or at least can be configured in the app to use the SD storage instead of the Internal. Since Internal storage is only 16G (of which the OS and built in apps use at least 4G) this is an important factor to consider. I have installed all the apps I intend to use the most and have already used up 8G of the 16G the device has internally. I don't think this will be a problem for me, but I do wish Samsung had offered a 32G version of the tablet as I would have got it just to be sure I had enough space. My iPad Air 2 has 128G and I have used only a third of the space, but the iPad does not even have the option of using SD external memory.

Overall, I am glad I have a decent Android tablet to augment my mobile experience. I can use the iPad for iOS specific needs and the Galaxy for Android things. I do have some cross over apps like Netfilx, Kindle, Audible, Adobe apps, Facebook, etc.

I would recommend purchasing the largest SD card you can afford (upto 256G) and take advantage of being able to have some if not most of your apps use it instead of the limited 16G Internal memory.

I have found the tablet to be fast - very fast for an Android device.

The tablet comes with a USB Power Adapter and a short Micro USB charge&sync cable (maybe 3 feet). I ordered a 10"" charge&sycnc able from Amazon to use instead so I am not so tightly tethered to the adapter, but the provided cable is adequate if you don't mind it's length.

Sound quality is pretty good thru the tablet speakers, though using earbuds is probably my preference. Sound it good.

I was able to easily cast to my Chromecat in Netflix and Spotify from the tablet.

The screen size is 10.1"" diagonal. Its length appears to be about the same as the iPad Air 2, but its width is narrower by about an inch, which gives the display a typical wide-screen 16:9 dimension as opposed to the iPad which has a 4:3 dimension. So technically, the screen size of the Galaxy does appear to be smaller in this regard. It is more than adequate for a tablet this size and does lend itself better than the iPad for Wide-screen video in my opinion.

I really like the Stylus - a feature that the iPad Air does not have natively. The iPad Pro does have a wonderful Pen, but it is an add-on cost. The Galaxy Stylus has a nice integrated place for it to be stored in the tablet. It is light weight and is a pleasure to use. I love how good some drawing apps exploit the use of the stylus very well. Samsung does provide a set of extra nibs for the pen - I just hope I don't lose them. I will need to get a case where I can keep all these little extras with the tablet.."
B01EUC7NPI,262,2611,Great for most purposes but to write equations you need more,Paul J. Werbos,5,-,04-Jun-17,-,0,"Fantastic for most purposes but not if you want to type equations.
I bought the Galaxy Tab A a year ago because, after a cataract operation, I needed a way to read books and papers without straining my eyes, without the unworkable bother of using glasses. The Galaxy Tab worked out much better than the paperwhite, especially the new paperwhites, not only because of the size of the screen, but because the android software was more tractable. Reading equations was no problem, at least after I learned to go to application settings and not let the kindle app stop me from reading pdfs. The ""memo"" app and the gmail app turned out to be more useful and important to my life than I had expected, although the wifi (in last year's version) is very choosy about what it will allow and for how long. (Works well in houses I visit, but not in hotels with weak wifi.) The free office app has also been very useful to me.
HOWEVER... to type equations or even mathematical characters, the available apps all are a disaster. Some promise a lot, and deliver next to nothing, at least by my standards. If you need to type equations, an android system won't do the job. If that's important enough to you, the extra cost of Apple or Microsoft tablets might be better, but for myself I plan to use pen and paper and desktop for such activities for now."
B01EUC7NPI,262,2612,I bought this because of the expandable sd memory card ...,none,1,-,04-May-18,3,2,I bought this because of the expandable sd memory card slot. I found out afterwards samsung has disabled the feature to allow using the sd card as internal storage. The ad card is only for storing picture and videos taken with the tablet. The operating system takes up nearly a 3rd of the storage.
B01EUC7NPI,262,2613,I don't understand all the positive reviews on this product. Speaker placement is a deal breaker!,Horsebytes,1,-,10-Apr-17,4,0,"I purchased this at Best Buy (who matched the Amazon price which was lower) and returned it the next day.

First off (and the deal breaker that I failed to notice in the store) is the speakers are only on the bottom of the portrait edge so if you watch a movie in landscape you can hear the sound from either the left or the right side - depending on which way you lay the tablet. The effect feels (or hears) like a speaker is out. Secondly, say you are laying in bed and you decide to watch a movie in portrait mode (to try and hear sound from both sides) and you rest the tablet on your chest or stomach - the speakers are muffled because they are on the edge of the tablet and not on the front or the back.

Deal breaker #2 is the picture quality is horrible! I know the specs say the resolution is ""up to 1920x1080"" and I was impressed in the store by the demo of the resolution in the store, but the tablet I got had horrible washed out resolution which was worse than the 1280x800 resolution on my old tablet that I'm used to. I don't understand this so maybe I got a defective tablet.

Deal breaker #3 - is the pen does not make as thin of lines as in the demos. The S pen I got started off off pretty thick and could go thicker but not as thin as the thin lines in the demos. Again this could be a defect in the tablet and/or pen that I got.

So, my search for an acceptable tablet continues. Sigh!"
B01EUC7NPI,262,2614,Shuts Down Repeatedly,Luke L,1,-,11-Jan-17,3,0,"Within a day or two of getting this tablet it started shutting down for no reason. Sometimes it would shut down immediately after turning it on, other times it would shut down after using it an hour or so. At times it would shut down up to five times in succession before running for a while. Other times it would lock completely and require a hard reboot. At Samsung customer services suggestion, I did a factory reset but that did not help at all. Since nothing worked, I decided the tablet I had must be defective so I exchanged it for another one. The second one had exactly the same problem. Both tablets were basically unusable as they kept shutting down for no reason. Samsung customer service suggested taking it to Best Buy, even though I didn't purchase it there. I chose not to do that and instead returned the tablet for a refund and will shop for something else that is more reliable. I would avoid this model completely."

I purchased my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 in May with the S pen included and I have to say that it is absolutely terrible. The 16 GB is more like 3 GB and I had to purchase a 64 GB memory card. The S pen is also terrible and it is impossible to calibrate. It never writes where you want to write and so taking notes on it is horrible. I was recommended to purchase new S Pen tips, so I did, but those didn't help at all. The S pen wouldn't can't even write a straight line!

I contacted customer service and they said to change my tips and It isn't the tips. I'm a student and I need to take notes, but can't on this deceivingly unreliable device.

Do yourself a favor and get the newer iPads unless you want a low to medium quality tablet. I am not even a fan of apple products; I use a Samsung galaxy phone, but I'm so disappointed by the S pen on this tablet that I needed to vent and say my piece. Thank you."
B01EUC7NPI,262,2616,"Great value, ease of use",Verita,5,-,29-Jun-16,9,1,"I'm pleased with this tablet. The screen has good resolution. It has two cameras with good lenses and aperture. (I learned the hard way that high megapixel cell phone cameras don't always produce sharp pictures.) Pictures are sharp, without distortion, even in indoor lighting. The rear camera has several settings, such as Sports, Portrait, multi-shot, panorama, automatic and Pro (manual). The front camera has a few, as well. It's very easy to set up if you back up your phone, e.g., online. It just downloaded all the same apps and I bluetoothed over a few pics and documents, although Samsung's Smart Switch app didn't work on my newish Android phone, so I couldn't use that. I had to Bluetooth my documents over, but it was easy enough, anyway. It's great for streaming movies. I'm very quickly getting used to the 10"" screen, LOL. The volume of the tablet alone is loud enough for private viewing without headphones, if you don't mind the limited sound quality. I found it easy to connect Bluetooth keyboards. I tried two different ones and both were fine. It has a split-screen feature for two apps at once. It arrived with the battery at 62%, and charged to 100% within about an hour. It came with a white cord and charger, even though it's black, so I'm wondering if I got a slightly used or test version. No matter, it's a review product, but I would hope the ones they sell come with color-matched accessories. It's easier to keep track of your chargers and cords that way. I'd recommend this tablet as a great value and very easy to use if you have any experience with Android.

Here's an important update: I tried to use a Sandisk micro sd card and it lost some of my photos. I have since read that Sandisk sd cards don't work well with Samsung tablets. I'm going to order a Samsung micro sd card instead, which Amazon has for 9.99 for 32gb.

Edited to add: I'm also impressed with the battery usage of this tablet."
B01EUC7NPI,262,2617,Great Hardware- Software Sucks if you want expansion room for lots of Apps!,Just a Customer,4,-,01-May-17,2,3,Unless you just want to have a VERY FEW apps and not much else on this tablet forget it--- The 6.0.1 version of Android will not allow moving the bulk of your APPS to the SD card! Yes you can move a few apps to the SD card; I've move all I could and still ran out of room the 2nd week I owned this Tab A. You have to root the device first in-order to be able to move most of the Apps to the SD card. Rooting is not for the average consumer.

I just wanted to add that when my child dropped the tablet off the bed and the screen suddenly went out, Samsung customer service was amazing about repairing it. We had bought it at Christmastime, so it was only six months old, and the phone call went well, no interrogation, they sent a prepaid return label, and then returned it back to us within two-three weeks.

I'm just so thankful bc it seems most people don't care at all about you these days. We bought this at Best Buy, not Amazon, but Samsung will take care of you regardless."
B01EUC7NPI,262,2619,Very good tablet with a so-so camera,C. Ang,4,-,21-Jan-17,-,0,"This is my first android tablet after several iPads. The tablet features are pretty good. It's fairly easy to get it up and running. The controls need a little getting used to given that it has three main buttons vs. an iPad's one main button on the front of the device. This tablet though has a Micro SD card that allows you expand its memory. The battery life is quite decent for regular use. The screen is big at 10.1"" and is very sharp. The touchscreen works really well and the S pen is a nice added touch. To be honest though, I am not a big fan of using the S pen but some people may find it beneficial.

There are only two things that I did not like on this tablet. First, the tablet is a little heavier than my past tablets (except maybe for my Gen 1 iPad). So if you are looking for a lightweight tablet, this may not be for you. The weight comes with the large size of this tablet. Second, the camera does not seem to shoot really sharp pictures even in well-lit situations. The pictures are a little grainy."

I did not know that Samsung has turned off the ability in Android to use the data card as contiguous memory with the device, meaning you cannot install programs, or move them, to the data card. This is referred to as ""adoptable storage"". As a result, I would not buy this again."
B01EUC7NPI,263,2628,"No Compass, Sensitive Bezel, Poor Button Positioning, Weird Speaker Position, Heavy",Isabella,3,-,23-Nov-18,-,0,"Cons:

This device has GPS but no compass. So while you can find your location, you cannot know your heading. Besides making the tablet completely useless in traveling and hiking, a whole lot of apps simply can't run without a compass because they assume such a basic sensor would exist. The hall sensor on the specs is NOT a compass.

Furthermore, despite the thick bezel, you cannot hold it like a normal person would. Touch events will misfire on the main screen when you grab the bezel.

The capacitive buttons are horribly positioned. I cannot hold the device in landscape because my thumb and palm will easily trigger the buttons. I cannot rest it nicely in portrait either, because my palm will again trigger the buttons.

The speakers are located at the bottom, so I cannot watch videos in portrait mode on my bed otherwise the sound will be muffled. (Use case: video on top, lecture notes bottom.) Watching movies in landscape mode won't work well either, because then the sound will point towards the side.

This tablet is also very heavy. And I do mean very.

Pros:

Processor is fast enough at this price point.

Cheap. Really cheap. I bought mine for less than US$100 during promotion from purchasing another Samsung product.

The S Pen is very useful and user-friendly. Aside from actual artists, I can't imagine anyone would buy an Apple Pencil that alone costs more than this tablet. A while ago my friends were ""amazed"" at the magnetic charging of the new Apple Pencil and how it improved from the (stupidly designed) previous version. Then I took out my inductively charged S Pen..."
B01EUC7NPI,263,2629,Touch screen unresponsive; internet really slow,Julie,1,-,11-Feb-18,1,0,"This tablet has problems with the touch screen, which very often is unresponsive. Takes forever to load web pages on the internet, regardless of connection speed. I regret having suspended my long standing boycott of Samsung products and purchasing this tablet, though it works fine for ebooks -- so far. Judging from some of the reviews though, appears to be only a matter of time before this product presents major hardware problems."
B01EUC7NPI,263,2630,A Gem of a tablet that to me has been dramatically overlooked.,Geoffrey Lyons,5,-,01-Dec-16,-,0,"8 months after my first rating, I finally noticed an update has fixed the big issue. So now I'll review in detail with several months of use. In short, for $250 this tablet is superb. The only limitation is the main drive size, but that's only because Samsung blocks the unified memory option in Android. The stylus is great, and I use it to take notes on PDFs for classes and lecture. I've found Xodo the app rather more convenient than others for this but your mileage may vary.

Pros
1920x 1200 screen: many budget tablets are less than this, but this in the minimum resolution I personally require across all devices. 4:3 Would be better for notes.
S-pen. It's just a few mm longer than that on my note 3, but more comfortable for my larger hands. The S-pen is the key purpose of the tablet. For me, going back to a device without an S-pen is like driving a car that can't go above 70 mph: it can still function 80% of the time but I'd want to get a new car asap. Samsung's use of I believe induction to power the active stylus of the S-pen VS the normal use of a battery operated pen creates a rather great experience. I primarily bought this for note-taking in class, and while I'd love to have a Microsoft Surface device, the cost benefit just wasn't there for me. For half the cost of the decent spec models of surface, I can buy a better spec'd laptop and this tablet and sync files via Google or One Drives. Several of my classmates can afford the Surface, and while I envy them, every once in a while I'll hear of someone having device issues with their stylus. Meanwhile I've actually lost a stylus, temporarily, but simply grab the one from my phone to continue taking notes, no syncing or pairing required.

3gb or ram, with widgets to help reduce waste. My typical use occupies about 2gb and includes typical Netflix, web browsing etc as well as reading long books, and taking notes in class. Not much of an android gamer.
Battery life: excellent. If I'm reading something and really want the battery to last I can turn everything off. My typical usage of browing several hour a day, Netflix/ YouTube a couple videos/music while cooking, note-taking in a couple classes/meeting, has actually lasted a couple days without a charge, although I don't let it get below 30%most of the time, and usually charge it daily.
Expandable memory: while newest high end devises are finally adding 128 gb regularly, the16gb of the main drive is quite limiting, but a $30 micro SD card on Amazon quite easily makes up for it. Most of the music apps can store on the external card as well as Prime and Netflix for offline viewing making everything that much more convenient.
Sound: typically good, decently loud when needed, but not too much. If needed, I simply sync and pair with Bluetooth speakers for additional volume.
Design: I rather like the design. Adequately thin with a comfortable heft when not in a case. The volume rocker and power button are next to each other on the 'right' side, and I have locked the device when trying to change volume. Likewise the power and earphone jack are on the 'top' edge next to the logo, and the speaker grilles and spend on the 'bottom'. It allows the 'left' an unbroken edge to place the tablet in landscape for video watching.
Dual pane apps/widget like apps: again, something I'm used to from note 3. It's not always useful, but then again it's nice to listen to YouTube while browing and not having to pay for YouTube red. Likewise pulling up a calculator while taking notes is convenient.

Bad:
Primary storage: 16 gb is rather limiting, adding twice the storage would have been a negligible cost difference except marketing and margins would probably add $100 to the user cost.
Speakers: one sided in landscape mode. Just why?
Online user community is nonexistent, and tablets aren't frequently on modding sites, so there isn't always a solution to be found online.

Wear and tear: I tried a couple of screen protectors, glass and plastic, and eventually decided to go without. The screen size just makes it difficult for me to apply cleanly. Actual at one point the glass protector was actually throwing off the s-pen accuracy as it warped. I'm still unsure of the particular physical reason, but weeks of frustration were solved by a naked screen. Otherwise I use a portfolio case that covers the screen when not in use.
The worst issue I ever had I was probably the cause: I was cleaning the screen after removing a protector, and used too much cleaning solution thatgot under the Tobe and bottom edges of the screen. The short and medium term effects were the multi window button being spammed making the tablet unusable, and the top several rows of pixels being unable to recognize the capacitance of my fingers, so I can't swipe down to affect the seeing bar when in portrait mode. It still recognizes the Spen, as those sensors are a different physical layer, but my solution has been to browse with the tablet upside down. It doesn't impact my note taking, and I caused the problem initially.

Observation: it's interesting that Samsung released this tablet at all, and I'm glad they did. The spen feature probably cannablized some sales for their later released galaxy tab s3. Meanwhile as not a top tier device many of the review sites had minimal coverage of it. My local best buy never had a display version to examine in person, and didn't even carry it during the Christmas of its release. The price I paid was the initial price after release and started out $100 than its list price. Apparently Samsung thought consumers would conflate the note 7 battery issues with the spen itself. 8 months later there's decent cheaper 3rd party cases, but Samsung itself never seemed to have any accessories for it.
Original
Glaring flaw that allows another person to create a new user account from the lock screen bypassing the lock. I'm too busy right now to research solution but will update when I've found a fix or Samsung pushes an update. I think the idea of multiple users is great, it's a terrible flaw to allow a bypass to a password. Samsung support is too invasive to complain, so let's see how well amazon review works.

Also had a longer review that got wiped with an accidental page refresh. Summary: bought for s pen and larger than phone screen, and s pen delivers for the price. Grill speaker on one narrow side, so crappy sound balance on movies. Whatever, affordable active stylus. When security issue is resolved I'll be more in depth.

Looking through reviews, Amazon really needs a better system to sort by device type"

Nearly a year later, it is still on Android 6, and the last security update was Dec 1 2016. While over this period Google has announced all types of vulnerabilities.

I'm addicted to this. It's a lot different than using a regular Wacom Intuos tablet and I like it much better. I also wish it had much more on board memory due to the face that it only has 9 GB left on it out of the box, so I have to be picky about what I put on it. Fortunately is has an SD slot so some apps can go on there. The pen works well in my hand and I find myself drawing for hours with it.

It has literally turned off and then back on while it was just sitting on my table, with nothing touching it!

B01EUC7NPI,264,2636,Very Good option,Amazon2 Customer2,4,-,26-Jul-16,7,2,"Excellent Tablet. This is a very portable and light weight tablet. It is thin and easy to
handle. The only down for me so far is that is WIFI only and for some this is ok. I would
have prefer an option for a 4LTE model.

Features: The size (10.1) & color (black) is great for business and the use of expandable memory even better. It looks like a giant version of my S7. I can load documents and other files in microsd for use on the tablet. No need to poke a hole for the sd.

Camera wise: I am not a big fan of tablet cameras and most people arent. The back is 8.0 MP and the front is 2MP.

Battery : Battery life is great in my opinion the size is 7,300 Ah. It holds good unlike my Samsung Note 10.1 tablet.

Memory: It comes with 16GM of memory but with the ability to expand with sd solves
that issue.

As for apps and games. I haven't downloaded any games so no experience there but most basic app. It works great.
Bluetooth works great I have pair it with other devices and seems to connect fine. Dual Speakers are at the bottom.

Overall It is a great business option."
B01EUC7NPI,264,2637,Nice Tablet,SandyCB,4,-,03-Aug-16,3,0,"We are using this tablet with four accounts for two adults and two teenagers. We have cable internet access and a fast router.

Overall we’ve been pleased. The graphics are good for regular use and are apparently wonderful for games and YouTube videos and movies, given how much time my teens devote to them. The larger display is great for web browsing and e-mail. Basically we find ourselves using the tablet instead of our smartphones for these activities.

The battery life is fantastic. Not only does it take a long time for the battery to lose a charge, but you can unplug it and it will hold the charge for an unbelievably long time. It seems a bit heavy and awkward to hold, but it’s worth it for the larger display. The camera and video work well and are easy to use.

The only real negative is that touch sensitivity is all over the place. Sometimes nothing you do can register, but at other times the lightest accidental touch starts programs you never intended. While annoying, this problem is intermittent and not enough to prevent daily use. We’ve had some success in minimizing it by adjusting the settings.

Overall, the biggest problem we have with this tablet is keeping it out of our kids’ hands so we can use it ourselves. That’s not such a big problem when you realize it saves on our teen’s smartphone's data overruns."

I was happy with it for just over 90 days, right after Costco's warranty expired, when I went to use it in the morning and it would not turn on. It had been working the previous evening when I used it and plugged it in to charge it. Finally we called Costco's online number as thankfully I had purchased their extended 2 year warranty and they were able to connect us quickly with Samsung. They are sending us a return box and will repair it but now I will be without a tablet for who knows how long? This is my third tablet - the first two were Asus ones. The first crapped out just after 90 days as the screen became cracked - I had been travelling with it and possibly something too heavy was placed on the bag that it was in, so I take responsibility for that one, but the second one crapped out after two years. It just became really slow and did very weird things - acted like a loose connection - so I finally gave up on it.

I took it to Best Buy and was told ""Sorry out of Warranty"". the Tablet at this point had less than 100 hours of use, so I felt Samsung might be interested in the customer service, and reliability aspect of their product. A call to Customer service went down hill quickly. No warranty, No help, unless I spend $175 to open an assessment appointment. Then I would get to pay for time and Materials to repair it in addition.
I would like to think these large companies would be more interested in their ""Brand"" than I have seen demonstrated here. Does being a Giant really make them numb to their customer base?

Just make sure when you get yours that there isn't a long delay in screen rotation. If it goes longer than one Mississippi to rotate screen once you rotated camera you may want to get a replacement.

Defective. I got two Tab A 10.1 tablets. I thought it was buggy when it came to auto rotate. I confirmed it when I was setting up the other one for a Christmas present. The other one a black one works way better than this one. This one would be slow on rotation, sometimes would need to flip several times to get it to rotate. Sometimes it would not rotate.

This one works fast and hand writing / drawing works great, as I expected.
The screen resolution is high therefore the display is crisp and clear.
The only thing I could not do is to connect it to PC via USB to transfer data. Already ask this question, hope that someone can show me the trick."
B01EUC7NPI,266,2651,Worked fine for only about 3-4 months,Brian,1,-,08-Aug-17,1,1,Purchased my tablet about 6 months ago and now I've been having issues with screen not functioning properly. I literally cannot push anything on the screen. Another problem I have frequently now is that the tablet will just randomly restart and then do a restart loop. Not sure why I even purchased another Samsung tablet after having issues with my previous Samsung tablet. It is my fault for trusting that Samsung would have fixed their product. Never again. We have a 1st generation iPad that works way better than this piece of junk.

Very few applications allow you to move them to external storage so the only thing your expanded storage can do is really hold media. I only have a few games, some apps, and netflix loaded players and I keep having to remove things just to do updates on existing preloaded apps.

FYI...yes there other ways of moving things around but the complication is not worth it. I want to be able to just use it. I moved from an iPad 2 because I also have a Samsung phone and I'm totally disappointed."
B01EUC7NPI,266,2653,so bad.,Amazon Customer,2,-,21-Aug-18,2,0,I bought this after my last one stopped working after two years. Wanted something cheaper and basic just to do the job.

The screen is very nice, crisp, clear, and bright. Compared to my old note 10.1 this is very fast. The reason I give it just 3 stars is the lack of a bezel on the device. No bezel makes it very difficult to hold the table with one hand. I find that I often have a finger on the touch screen. A case makes it a little bit better; but I still consider the lack of a bezel a major flaw in the design for a large tablet. I see no positives for the lack of a bezel."

I sent it in which is great and fine, easy enough. Get it back quickly, sweet. Too bad they didn't send the charging adaptor back with it (they told me to send the tablet with it), sent me a different cable than what I sent them, tore off the screen protector (why did they need to do that for a port malfunction?), and the sd card is missing. They also wiped the entire tablet. When confronting them about it, they basically blamed the courier and did not admit any fault whatsoever. I will never buy another samsung product ever. Customer service is horrible and the people they used to fix their products have a 2 out of 5 rating. Now it doesn't surprise me why they sell exploding phones."

B01EUC7NPI,266,2659,"Great, but LACKS CONNECTIONS & other cons **AVOID Android version NOUGAT! ***",Ruthann Smith,4,-,27-Mar-17,-,0,"07-09-17 Edited: Check the Android version...Avoid NOUGAT! I regretfully updated from Marshmallow to Nougat and it RUINED EVERYTHING.

This is/was a great a tablet (NOT NOUGAT version), but in my opinion a bit overpriced, although the S PEN is worth the extra $ (see bottom for comments)

In order to make this review a little bit more helpful , I've decided to focus on the cons.

So far, there are just a few things that are better than my $88.00 RCA Viking 10 Pro tablet: VERY LONG BATTERY LIFE & much faster speed.

Here are some 'Cons' to consider before spending the money. I will update as I go along.

- ****LACK OF PORTS/CONNECTIONS ** !!: SACRIFICE for a SLIGHTLY THINNER & LIGHTER Could have been a 5!
The Samsung ONLY HAS 3: power, headphone, and MicroSD (& microphone). They have adapters for the HDMI & USB etc., but they are not cheap. Plus you can't keep them plugged in all the time because they stick out. You have to carry them with you and are easily misplaced or lost. I haven't seen any covers that would keep them, plus it would have to be fat.
I have an RCA Viking 10 Pro tablet. It has all the bells and whistles but unfortunately the battery is really short and the tablet is slow. It has all the connections you need: HDMI, USB, Headphone, Micro SD card, and Camera. The sacrifice of a slightly thinner and slightly lighter tablet.

- SYMBOLS: On the 'ABC' screen, SYMBOLS are VERY LIMITED
Symbols are only available on the number keys plus 2 keys on the bottom. Unlike other keyboards the other symbols are not available on the letter keys
The only symbols on the screen are:
On the number keys: - @ # / % ^ & * ( )
The 2 keys on the bottom: , ! . ?
This is done by pressing and holding a key, let's say you want the ' @ ' symbol, like regular keyboards the ' @ ' is located on the '2' key.
For a tablet for business, this is less efficient.
On my Samsung s7 smart phone, when you press & hold the period ' . ' key, a popup displays the 10 recently used symbols.
SUGGESTION for all mobile Keyboards - have option for Numeric keypad same as the option for symbol keypad

- SPLIT SCREEN: Most apps DON'T SUPPORT IT . Real DISAPPOINTMENT - basically USELESS.

- VIDEO/SCREEN: Personally I don't see much difference as my RCA Viking Pro 10 and my old Kindle.

- VIDEO/SOUND: Not impressed. I was watching Person of Interest which has very impressive, as well as distinctive music for it's characters, including bass (what I really like about the show). I connected it to my 'Creative' speaker, which works great, but the music was kind of flat, not very discernible. It does have advanced sound settings and an equalizer, but 'normal' should at least be satisfactory.

MINOR
- Wish the docking port for the S Pen was at the top of the tablet rather than the bottom.

- Wish the S Pen was a little bit longer.

- Camera on the back is not flat. It would be better if it had ‘feet’ that would lift the tablet to make it level, or was inset.

- The back and the application viewer at the bottom of the tablet are pretty sensitive.

S PEN is EXCELLENT !
Just to name a few things:
-Available from the keyboard.
-Starts when you take the pen out.
-Write to text is great. The recognition is SUPERB! , even when using combined writing of cursive and print for one word. You don't have to perfet penmanship.
-It's intuitive
-When the tablet is off and you remove the S Pen the tablet basically becomes like a chalkboard. You could write anything you want right away instead of having to open & unlock the tablet, then open an app.
-The S-Pen will also allow you to 'Smart Select' to copy text on the screen when it is allowing you to hold to highlight text to copy."
B01EUC7NPI,266,2660,A real love/hate relationship,Pam Mahony,2,-,07-Oct-17,2,0,"I want so much to like this tablet but i can't. I am sure that others have written about its virtues, but mine seems to have a fatal flaw. The screen gets larger and smaller at random times. At first I thought I was hitting buttons at random, but, no. It was the computer ""doing its thing"". It suddenly took me back to a prior site as I was reading a book. When I tried to get back in, it had locked me out and showed that I had not read anything. I could go on, but you get the idea. I am taking it back tomorrow, with much sadness, but I cannot deal with this anymore."
B01EUC7NPI,267,2661,Gift from Husband,Shae,5,-,24-Mar-17,1,0,"My husband surprised me with this tab. I absolutely love it. I use it to read my books and magazines from kindle. I also play games - Covet Fashion and Kim K.

The magazines load so much easier and better than on the kindle fire which i was using. I only wish it came with 32GB memory"
B01EUC7NPI,267,2662,BAD Decision,jh,2,-,21-Feb-17,-,0,"Mine from Samsung's Web-site.... If you want LESS than half of the space advertised, buy it. If you want Samsung apps you cannot remove OR control, buy it. And the problems with making simple modifications...WOW! Go ahead, buy it.... It is a very nice device; just a very bad approach with the proprietary crap/control. Anyway, rooting mine soon...making it a better product...in my opinion...."
B01EUC7NPI,267,2663,Stand broke immediately,Jodi H.,2,Yes,11-Apr-17,1,1,The stand broke immediately. I don't recommend this case.
B01EUC7NPI,267,2664,I love this tablet,James Daneke,5,-,28-Apr-18,1,0,I love this tablet. I tried the Galaxy Tab S3 and for less than half the price I prefer this one. I got this at Costco for 189 with 32GB memory card. Hard to beat such a deal. I got a great case from Amazon and now good to go.
B01EUC7NPI,267,2665,"First month was great then I began getting a ""weak charging"" warning",TeacherMac,3,-,21-Apr-17,1,0,"First month was great then I began getting a ""weak charging"" warning.
Battery charge draining while tablet is on but not in use.
Used 3 different chargers with different cables without any change.

B01EUC7NPI,267,2666,This tablet is worth the money.,LouP,5,-,24-Nov-17,1,0,I had the 7inch for two years and I love it. But this one is 10 times better. Its big and really thin. I don't understand why people spend $400 to $700 for a Ipad.
B01EUC7NPI,267,2667,Would be great if wifi was working,Kerim Bajramovic,2,-,13-Mar-17,-,0,It's a solid tablet but unfortunately it's wifi is horrible. I have to constantly turn off and on wifi because this tablet does not connect to internet after waking up. Come to think of it this was also problem with Samsung Galaxy s4 that I have owned. Tablet with Internet issue is like having a brick on your table...dead weight....useless.
B01EUC7NPI,267,2668,GALAXY TAB A REBOOT MYSTERY. BUYER BEWARE,Big Ron,1,-,09-Feb-17,-,0,This tablet was working great for the first few weeks. Then it started randomly rebooting when streaming movies from Crackle and Netflix. It has gotten to the point where it reboots 1 to 2 times a day! I have a new 128gb Sandisk SDXC card in it. Movies downloaded from Netflix are saved on the SD card. What a huge disappointment Samsung!
B01EUC7NPI,267,2669,Bought at costco when it was less than $200. ...,Amazon Customer,3,-,03-Mar-18,1,0,"Bought at costco when it was less than $200. Tab is awsome, but i can't recommend it due to google pop up ad lately. Google pop up ad keep popping up whenever i am using it such as reading and viewing moives. I can't turn it off. It is driving me crazy. Going to buy ipad."
B01EUC7NPI,267,2670,Can't playback 4K videos (in general) and videos recorded from my Note 4,Alex,1,Yes,18-Nov-16,10,0,"1. Cons: Can't playback 4K videos recorded from my Note 4 (or from other sources) -- the GPU struggles to the point where it just freezes, tried VLC Player, the built-in Video Player and MX Player. MX/VLC try to, but uses SW (no HW renderer available to decode) to render the video and it's very jerky. The built Video Player doesn't have the codec Samsung uses to create 4k videos on it's phone. You get ""Unable to Play video. Unsupported Video Codec."" Then it tries to play the audio portion of the video file. Good stuff here. Also, even though I closed a video, when I try to open another, I get, ""currently unable to play video. stop the other video and try again."", Huh? Wow. Junk.

My two year old Tab 8.4 Pro can playback all my 4k recorded videos perfectly. This may have an Octo-core CPU (but in general, also feels sluggish compared to my Note 4 phone and Tab 8.4), but the GPU performs like my old Tab 2 7"", meaning, it doesn't perform at all.

2. Screen Display: While generally very good, with no toning issues (pink/red/greenish hues), it is slightly dim/darker around the edges of the display. Sort of like Samsung TV's sets from 2013.

3. Performance is not what I expected from an Octo-core processor (and no, power saving is not turned on) It's feels a little sluggish, when compared to my Tab 8.4 and Note 4 phone.

4. Very slooooow charge. Mine came in at 54% charge, and it took about 4 hours to get it 100%

5. Charger on top of the tablet? Huh?

Pros.
1. For $189, it's not a bad deal, esp. if you don't plan on playing back 4K video (which in this case, it's useless, don't buy it.) You won't feel too bad that simply because the battery is dead and can no longer charge in 3-4 years (while everything else works) you have to throw it out, as good luck finding a battery for it, let alone the cost to ship it and replace it with a dubious non-oem battery. Kudos to Apple for OEM battery replacements even out-of-warranty for $99 (but that's the only thing I give to Apple.)

2. Large battery (7300mAh), but also a con because it takes so long to change.

3. LED Light on back, nice to have as a flashlight, esp. at night.

4. Very nice frame and feel to the tablet, feels sturdy.

Bottom Line:
If your goal was to playback 4K video from this device (in addition as having it as a general media device), avoid it, it doesn't work. Otherwise, it's a cheap decent media device. Yes, I know, it's not a 4K screen, but the device should still be able to do downscale playback. After all, most people with newer 4K capable phones, are recording in 4K now; there's no point to film in 1080P when you have 4K."
B01EUC7NPI,268,2671,Great tablet,Amazon Customer,5,-,09-Mar-17,-,0,"I loooooove this tablet! It is light, screen is super big, which is a good thing for my aging eyes. It has great resolution, it's a very fast tablet. Especially like that it has MS Office installed. Im anazed at how long the battery lasts. I've using it for 5 hours and it is still at 95% I'm very happy with my purchase"
B01EUC7NPI,268,2672,Best tablet ever,Cheese,5,-,09-Aug-18,-,0,"I bought this for my older brother. it made his old one look very small. gonna buy another one this upcoming payday for myself.

After nine days it began turning itself off after between 1 and 15 minutes of use. Spoke with Samsung tech support twice and they wanted me to send it in for repair. After 9 days of use! Returned it. Seen a lot of other reviews with similar stories so it appears Samsung had some lousy quality control this Christmas season.
B01EUC7NPI,268,2674,Value Tablet,Kona,4,-,10-Jan-19,-,0,"Overall, it's a good tablet for the price. Some gripes include being heavy, poor audio quality and inadvertent screen changes. I use it mainly for web browsing and email."

B01EUC7NPI,268,2678,Great tablet,AmazonCustomer,5,-,11-Aug-16,1,1,"Great tablet for everyday use. Resolution is great, speed is fast, easy to hold.

However it feels more like a large smartphone instead of a tablet. Before moving to the Tab A 10.1, I had a Note 10.1 (2012 edition, the old one). The Note's software felt like it was built for a tablet, whereas the Tab A feels more like my phone. This isn't a huge deal, and you will feel at home if you like the smartphone feel."

B01EUC7NPI,268,2680,Overheating of tablet and cord/plug.,Bonnie Codrey,3,-,31-Mar-17,-,0,"My husband bought me the tablet for Christmas and I do like it very much but I have some concerns. The tablet gets very, very warm when I am using it. When I plug it in, the cord gets very warm but the plug in the tablet gets too hot to touch. I do not dare to leave it plugged in unless I am using it because I am afraid it will will catch on fire. My husband also has a Galaxy tablet and his does not heat up like mine nor does his cord or plug get hot. His is a newer version in that it has built-in wi-fi."
B01EUC7NPI,269,2681,Buyer Beware,Michael Everett,1,-,09-Mar-18,-,0,"It was OK while it worked, but after about 3 months, one day it just wouldn't accept my sign-in and also voice had turned on, not that it rejected my password, but the sign in itself was not responsive. I phoned an Samsung tech who said ""no problem -- when it reboots, it will start fresh again"". But how do you reboot if you can't pull the battery out? There's no way I know of to force it to run it's battery down without rebooting, so I let it sit for a couple of months till the battery was dead, then plugged the charger in, but nothing had changed. So Samsung took $350 from me for 2 or 3 months use of a tablet they don't know how to fix. Live and learn. I'll get an Apple to replace it, and they stand behind their products."
B01EUC7NPI,269,2682,Not very good.,Hugh A. Caldwell,2,-,06-Apr-18,-,0,This a very awkward device. The borders are too small to hold it comfortably and the speakers are just about in the worst place imaginable. It also seems very slow to load websites with Firefox.

I can't get over how responsive and precise the pen is. We haven't had any problems with it. My kids have been able to navigate it very easily and so far it is holding up well with their use."
B01EUC7NPI,269,2684,Not as good as my old Galaxy Tab,Misty Rodriguez,4,-,26-Dec-18,1,0,"This table is in need of a software update with bug fixes. Windows minimize by themselves and the touchscreen isn't quite accurate. I also can't get it to save files on the external card. Battery life is good, display quality is good and sound is very good."
B01EUC7NPI,269,2685,Poor manufacturing of video cable / port and poor customer service,momof4avndale,1,-,28-Jan-18,1,0,"The tablet is overall ok in terms of performance etc; however, it has serious problems with the loss of the display due to an internal connection failure. While under warranty (1 year) Samsung fixed one, then the other failed and they wouldn't fix (13 months). I opened to try to fix and the internal connect for the video cable just crumbled apart. Search the internet for Samsung black screen and you'll see plenty of posts. There are times that it needs a reboot and I accept that as an occasional issue, but failure due to a poor connection inside I don't. I even asked when the first one was getting serviced and they said there will be no problem with the other two...well screen 2 is now bad and Samsung won't do anything about it because now it is one month past warranty. It is an obvious poor component (manufacturing) cause. Class action people -- take a look.

I would't buy this series at all...if you do, go too Costco for their 2 year warranty....bought 3 and in 13 months, 2 have failed...you do the math."

B01EUC7NPI,269,2687,Solid tablet but you shouldn't be paying $600.,tpkatsa,5,-,14-Feb-17,4,0,"Hard to believe the price here... I got mine at Best Buy for $229 - $70 off sale, normally $299. And Amazon is charging $600? That's crazy.

Anyway this is a very solid tablet for the money. It's probably as fast as the Dell 5050 I had. The connector is positioned at the top center of the tablet so I never need to take it out of the case to charge it which is very convenient. The only minor complaint so far is that sometimes it doesn't play my movies (I have to reboot it then it works) but that may be a problem with the app VLC I'm using, not necessarily with the tablet itself. The display is vibrant and crisp at 1920x1220. Just have to be careful with that connector. Seems like they've strengthened it a bit from the last Samsung I had where it broke (the Tab 3), but you still don't want to jostle it or knock it around too much."

B01EUC7NPI,272,2719,Samsung tablet just OK - I use it everyday - but its not as good as my older tablet,R. Silva,3,-,26-Dec-17,2,0,"Update 2019 - Use it every day. Got accustomed to its limitations. A lot of the bugs I mentioned below seem to have been resolved. But its still lacking in features and forces me to delete numerous Apps due to lack of memory - even though I have added an SD card it doesn't seem to take advantage of.

I got a Samsung SM-T580 tablet for Christmas to ""update"" my older tablet with newer technology. So far I am hating this Samsung product. I often get brown-outs on the Samsung screen which I cannot explain or recover from. I don't know what causes this. The screen will suddenly go very dim and no touching the screen face will bring the brightness back unless I quit the app and relaunch it.

My main product feature issues (crashes aside) are the lack of a compass and gyroscopes in a rather pricey tablet. I'm also finding that the slightest touch near the edge of the screen can have unexpected results. This makes it very difficult to hold without causing some unexpected window to pop up or the app to disappear completely. I own several Android devices including a TV Box running Android 7 - a new Android TV and an older Android tablet running 4.04. So I am not a novice. I have compared the same apps running on both the TV Box and this new Samsung tablet - both running Android 7..It looks like parts of the screen image on the Samsung are missing on some of my favorite apps (perhaps a mismatch between the Samsung aspect ratio and the apps design? - However the missing menus are there on my Android TV but not the Samsung tablet.

My old tablet - unfortunately is no longer supported and is stuck at Android OS 4.04. Even though supposedly outdated - it still outperforms this Samsung Galaxy by a mile. (One of my favorite apps is a sky view program which cannot be supported by the SM-T580 due to its lack of a compass. I'm so disjointed that I intend to return it ASAP.."

It's been a very long time but I feel that the few minutes I'm taking now are justified by the sheer frustration this device caused me tonight. I'm tech-savvy enough to know nothing I did was the source of my frustration with this device. I spent hours trying to sync (through various programs and apps) my contacts from an iPhone. The touch screen worked intermittently and frequently froze. Other times certain areas of the screen would freeze and others wouldn't. The tab frequently asked me to sign into an account (through different apps) I was already signed into and then upon filling out the sign in prompt it would tell me I was already signed in. Stay away from this awful product. Also there is no way to send or receive iMessages (which I assumed was a problem we shouldn't have in 2016) so if that has any bearing on your decision I would recommend more heavily than I already have to stay away.

And I am really glad I bought it from there. I had the same issue with two tablets:
1st tablet -
Opened the packaging to find a new shiny tablet.
Directly plugged it into its charging brick and let it fully charge (from an initial 2%). Charging took over 3 hours (maybe the first sign of issues to come).
Once at 100%, disconnected and booted it.
Greeted with the standard language section (English was the default selection)
Selected all the basic stuff, got on my WiFi. a couple setup pages took over a minute to transition between (odd).
Once Android booted the process of connecting my mail accounts, and the like work as expected until...
Black screen. While typing away the screen went black. Push buttons, home, volume, power... boot screen shows; it was off.
Once rebooted I was typing away this time doing an OS update. No issues. Reboot as required.
Once rebooted, after OS update, 5 minutes later while working on the tablet, BLACK SCREEN.
Power button and the device is booting up.
This black screen while using the tablet happened at least 10 times before I gave up and headed back to the BoxStore to exchange it (glad to not have to ship it back anywhere).
Exchange was easy.
Back home, unbox it.
Noted that the protective cover over the tablet is made of a different material and the tab to help lift the device out of the box is pushed under the device; not useful. Why is the material different? Why is the tab not out as designed?
Oh well. Power the device up with its brick. Starting at 57% this time (odd, why different power levels device to device?)
Charge to 100% takes a couple hours, Ok I guess.
Power on, First screen, language selection is defaulted to Spanish. Why was the first one defaulted to English?
(I noticed a bit of rough plastic around the edges on this device, but the screen glass is set evenly all around the edges, something I noticed the first one was a bit off all around the edges but I figured it was just a manufacturing issue)
Oh well, next setup screens proceed as the previous device except no pages are delayed like the first one. Ok, maybe this one will work better.
Nope!
Within 15 minutes of use, BLACK SCREEN. power button to boot the device back up.
30 minutes later BLACK SCREEN again!
boot
45 minutes later BLACK SCREEN!
boot, I went into setting and selected Factory Reset, wiped its HDD (yeah I know not a ""H"") put it back into its protective sleeve, put the power brick and cable with it in the box and I will be returning this one and getting my money back.
What a disappointment.
Is the stock at my local store counterfeit?
Is this Samsung product just a terrible model?
Is the true manufacturer of this model have terrible QC?
Either way, I am going to check out other Android tablets (and maybe have to bite the Apple and get an iPad :-( )
Hope this helps future buyers."

B01EUC7NPI,279,2784,Very nice for the price,AdventureInUtah,4,Yes,14-Aug-18,51,0,"I was looking for an inexpensive tablet that could perform a few tasks. Here is what I wanted and how this tablet performs:

1. Office applications - This tablet does a great job of allowing me to open and edit Excel spreadsheets and Microsoft Word documents. I also am able to use PowerPoint presentations on this tablet in front of customers. It works well for my needs.

2. Email - It handles my Outlook (exchange) account as well as my personal GMail account. A simple task, handles easily.

3. Movies/Video - I use it a good bit for Netflix and videos on planes. The picture is HD quality and works wonderfully.

4. Web browsing - works very well even with multiple tabs open.

5. GPS - I use this tablet in my Jeep on offroad trails. I use the Gaia GPS app to navigate on trails. It is able to receive GPS signals without the need for cell signals/wi-fi. It gives me a nice large map and is very accurate for my backcountry travels.

6. Remote desktop - This is one of my favorite things to use this tablet for. I have a computer at my corporate office that is logged into our internal system. I am able to use the remote desktop app to access that computer from anywhere. It actually works better on the tablet than my laptop.

Now, let's talk about looks. It is a very attractive looking tablet. The screen is vibrant and works well. I have no idea if the back is metal or plastic, but it is high quality and looks great.

Cameras - They are ok, but my iPhone 7+ is far superior so I have not used them much. I do use the camera to take pictures of receipts when I ma traveling. I would say the cameras suffer in comparison to most high end cell phone cameras.

The screen is really odd in that it picks up a lot of fingerprints. I thought that it was just the nature of the beast, until I put a tempered glass screen protector on it. Suddenly, the fingerprint issue went away. Now the screen stays relatively clean and clear. I would recommend this one:

My other accessory purchase was a small bluetooth tablet keyboard. A great accessory if you are doing work on it.

Overall, I'm really happy with this inexpensive tablet. Is it the best for ""power users""? No, but for me it is good enough that I can leave my laptop home on some business trips. My only regret is waiting so long to buy one.

Edit: After owning this tablet for a month, I love it. It actually has me considering replacing my iPhone 7+ with a Samsung Note the next time I upgrade. The only reason that I chose this tablet over an iPad was the better GPS capability and being cheaper was a bonus. I don't think the iPad would have been that much different in daily use.

B01EUC7NPI,279,2785,I love the s pen,El,5,Yes,03-May-17,28,1,"So I got this for two reasons: digital art and watching Netflix. I love the s pen, it works great and I'm finally able to get into digital art which I'm really pumped about. Hooray! :D"
B01EUC7NPI,279,2786,I LOVE it!,victor demise,5,Yes,27-Sep-18,1,0,"This is my first (real*) tablet, so I have little to compare it to, but it has a really GREAT picture, nice, loud speakers, the front camera takes pretty sharp images, it comes with a good selection of apps, it's pretty fast as far as loading pages etc, and it streams video pretty flawlessly. Overall, the OS/interface is easy to use. Things like adjusting the settings is easy enough to master.

My only issue is the SIZE.
I thought BIGGER would be better, and it is, for watching movies etc. It's just a bit awkward to hold when typing, in both the horizontal and vertical positions- nothing terrible, but my wife has a smaller tablet that feels pretty ""right"" when typing on it. My hands are pretty average sized. Someone with larger hands would likely find it more comfortable than me. That said, the size is not a deal breaker by any means- and really, who doesn't appreciate a larger screen?!

Overall I really love it!

I do suggest purchasing a nice case for it.
After doing WAY too much research on cases, I bought the following (link below), and it's fantastic!
It covers the screen (book style) when not in use and serves as a three-position stand. Made of quality leather and a nice custom fit for the Galaxy Tab A (the one with NO PEN!).

B01EUC7NPI,279,2787,"Thick and heavy, but fast and beautiful screen",Mike Tarrani,5,Yes,31-Oct-18,2,0,"I upgraded from my old Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4-Inch, and the difference is like night and day. This is a fairly basic tablet, but much faster than the Tab Pro, and the screen is exponentially nicer.

Do know that this is not some slim, light and trendy tablet. It's surprisingly thick and heavy. However, it is not so thin that it will bend like yet another Samsung that I own - a Tab Pro 12.2.

The 10.1 inch screen has a lot more real estate than the 8.4 this table is replacing. The major reason why I rated this so highly is the price, combined with the obvious difference in both speed and display. It's not cutting edge, but is a workhorse."
B01EUC7NPI,279,2788,Excellent Tablet,S. Farrell,5,Yes,19-Feb-17,5,0,"I've had iPads and several factors of Kindle Fire. I like the Kindles but wanted a little more power and a tablet that has access to the full Android ecosystem I bought the Galaxy and an NVIDIA Shield while I like them both I Love the Galaxy it's large screen and light weight are perfect my use its even powerful enough to take advantage of top quality drawing apps it performs every bit as well as an iPad If your looking for a good value in a tablet, this is it"
B01EUC7NPI,279,2789,Love this tablet!,Silver Tantara,5,Yes,06-Oct-17,4,0,"I love this tablet. It's easy to use & navigate. I mostly use it to play games & watch Netflix & HULU. The screen is gorgeous. It make movies look fantastic. I wish the speakers were a little louder sometimes, but you can only do so much with the speakers in a flat tablet. I have an external, travel speaker I can plug in if I need more sound."
B01EUC7NPI,279,2790,Better price tag than similar apple products,Don Holmes,5,Yes,16-Mar-18,1,0,"Like the pic quality, sound is decent, but i almost always use sennheiser wireless headphones anyway. I use it just for checking email and watching movies when I'm bored. Had its cousin years ago, but it grew legs or something and left home never to be seen again. I can only compare it to RCA version, and really i think either one would have been okay. I chose this because of battery life and, my other samsung pleased me well. It communicates with no issue to my headphones and my wifi, and i like the on-screen prompts it gives when notifications, etc, arrive. I did upgrade the charger to a great after market because it charges faster, but the stock one will work too. I am Appleized in all electronics except this, but if being connected across all devices is important to you, you can use drop box and likely other apps for that. Music use from iTunes may be possible, but its not a large concern for me as its not my everything device."
B01EUC7NPI,280,2791,Love this tablet sometimes,Val,3,Yes,14-Nov-17,7,0,"Love, love, love this tablet. I did a lot of research before purchasing. It is very user friendly, easy to set up and navigate. Provides a much larger viewing screen than my Kindle. I also have an ipad and much prefer this as it seems easier to use for me. Camera takes good quality pictures, and it comes with word etc. Installed, programs I use pretty regularly. Highly recommended.

Update: Revising my rating to 3.5. While the tablet works well when it works, it has started freezing on me. I have to hold in the power button along with the volume button for it to reboot. Had I not gone back to check others' reviews, I would not have known how to get it rebooted. It's happened twice since I purchased this tablet and that's disappointing as it shouldn't happen at all."
B01EUC7NPI,280,2792,Handy Tablet,Bestsontheroad,5,Yes,06-Jan-18,1,0,"We are a Samsung Galaxy Tab family, and this addition did not disappoint us! We bought this one for my husband and he absolutely loves it. He literally uses it constantly and since it is newer than mine, I borrow it occasionally. It has clear resolution, he shows videos to kids, takes a ton of pictures that he posts to Facebook, and keeps his Google Drive organized.

Both of us love the 10.1 because it isn't too small that you can't see what you are doing, but it is not so large that it is cumbersome. It just seems to be the handiest size available for us."
B01EUC7NPI,280,2793,Excellent tablet at an excellent price.,JR,5,Yes,17-Oct-17,2,0,"I use this tablet all the time. It's replaced my laptop for basic internet browsing and email. I do a lot of online shopping with it, too. It's probably not the fastest or most feature-filled tablet available, but it handles all the basics with ease - including most android games. For the money, this is a great machine."

B01EUC7NPI,280,2800,Beautiful 10.1 Tablet!,BubbleMilky,5,Yes,08-Oct-16,14,0,"Beautiful tablet. Gave this as a gift to my sister for her birthday, she absolutely loves it. Everything is snappy fast and the marshmallow update was done right when the tablet connected to WiFi. Beautiful screen, perfect for watching videos. Love that the charge port is a micro USB, universal with all the other devices we have (less chargers to lug around when going on vacation). If I had to complain about something, it would be I wish it came it internal 32gb instead of 16gb. Luckily my sister doesn't install much apps and puts all her videos on the SD card, so it doesn't affect her usage.

--Edit--
I bought the S-Pen version love it! Battery life is absolutely a beast! Does everything I need, came with Nougat installed. Screen resolution is fine for the videos I watch."

I have used it for noting during the class with either samsung NOTE or One-note.

B01EUC7NPI,289,2887,An Aritst's Review: Awesome for drawing but go buy a stand too.,K,5,-,17-Apr-18,2,0,"I've had this tablet for two years now. I got the white one.

I bought this because I wanted to do digital art better. I previously used a computer and mouse, which is nothing like real drawing. As for those USB drawing tablets, they felt unnatural, and I prefer to look directly at a surface on which the lines appear as I draw them.

Pros:
* Drawing is easy. I use the apps Medibang Paint as well as Flipaclip for animation.
* The S Pen includes pressure sensitivity, which allows you to make fluid line art and coloring.
* The tablet itself is not laggy. It runs fast.
* The S Pen is stored inside the tablet and can be pulled out, Nintendo DS style. It's not separate so you won't lose it.
* Then S Pen does not need to be charged unlike the Apple Pencil of the iPad pro.
* A much cheaper alternative to creating art on an iPad pro or Cintiq (plus unlike the Cintiq, it is portable.)

Cons:
* The only big con is that the tablet itself can be heavy. Not saying it will weigh you down in your backpack, but you certainly cannot just hold it in your hands and draw/browse for more than 10 minutes without your arms tiring out. This is especially apparent if you have a case on.

To fix this, I recommend buying a a tablet stand. I personally got this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BNML5S5/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

A stand will allow you to draw without eventual neck or back pain that you would get from looking at the tablet flat on the table or down in your hands. I don't recommend a case that folds out into a stand if you're going to draw. The angle is not high enough, and you cannot prop it up to draw in portrait (vertical) mode.

Check out the art I created on my tablet!"
B01EUC7NPI,289,2888,Had for 2 years!!,Jackie,4,-,30-Nov-17,1,0,"I’ve had this tablet for two years and I love it! I only have one problem with it. The screen resolution is rather low for being a newer product in the past few years. Watching shows, videos, and movies looks completely fine. It’s when you see words on the screen or wallpapers, basically anything on the software you can see pixels. It is a fantastic tablet and has not slowed down in two years. Great battery life I say it worsened after a year and leaving the tablet idle would kill the battery. Great sound and runs smoothly. Like I said videos and stuff like that looks fine, it’s more like words and software visuals look pixelated."
B01EUC7NPI,289,2889,Stuck with an essentially 10GB memory TAB,Soupayan Sarkar,2,-,16-Feb-17,-,0,"First of all, I did not buy this through Amazon. I bought it from another vendor.

The graphics, clarity, ease of use, S Pen everything is very good.

But, there is a limitation with the memory. You will have around 10GB memory on device for your files.

You may add SD cards, have your songs, movies etc over there. But you cannot install your apps there. Nor can you move your installed apps on the SD card. Nor you can move the apps data on the SD card through any option. You can however move the files from the device to SD card manually through My Files. However I am not sure how that might affect the function of the Apps.

I surely would have preferred the point on ""Expandable"" memory more accurate."

I wanted to buy it and so I read the reviews.
I was very disappointed to read this accumulation of defects until I realized that tablets concerned with another screen size, or other models with other screen resolutions, different memory size,
Samsung has several factories where they manufacture different models and even have models made in two or more different factories.
Commenting on Samsung tablets as if they were all the same, will not find it useful to anyone.

Went through customer support to trouble shoot, trying to reboot it, but no luck.

I build websites for a living and needed to see what other users experience.

Pleased with the picture, sound, and build but disappointed by the overall performance, it's a little slow. I finally had to turn off the keyboard clicks because they were a beat behind my taps.

A few things:

• As of December 2018, this device runs Samsung Experience 9.5 with Android Oreo, with possible performance compromises

• GPS does work offline with downloadable maps, though you'll need WiFi for Waze, live traffic updates, etc.

• This model does not have an FM chip so it cannot tune in over-the-air broadcast radio, but you can get radio streaming via WiFi

Bottom line, this is still a viable machine for your Kindle reading, casual surfing, and email, but save your sheckles for a newer model, if you can. You might be glad you did."

B00DVFLJKQ,1,1,Will not do system updates or download newer versions...,A. M. Caldwell,1,Yes,17-Jan-18,6,1,This tablet will not download newer versions or do system updates.

B00DVFLJKQ,1,2,one year old and it still is the one to beat even thru 2015,Kindle Customer,5,Yes,10-Nov-14,23,0,"i recently purchased the nexus 9 and was disappointed with the quality of the tablet. i returned it and as usual amazon proves to be the leader in customer service. so on the hunt i went for a tablet. i gave my dad my nexus 7 2013 about 6 months ago and he fell in love with it. i was playing with it a cpl days ago and realized how much i loved this device. so much so that i bought one for me (32gb) there is no other tablet in this size that can beat the quality, specs and value. it feels and fits so well in one hand. it is a solid tablet, nothing cheap or plastic-y here. simply holding it will impress you. the screen is bright and colors are rich and balanced. this screen is a true 1080 HD screen. snappy performance with a quad processor that handles multi tasking and games effortlessly. speakers are nice and have good sound. yes, the bezels on the top and bottom are thick but the first time you hold it in landscape mode, you will thank google for it. no worries about your thumbs being in the way. i thought bigger would be better but this size is great for travel. the trend seems to be bigger and bigger with these items but imho, this size fits my needs so well. on to value: in about 1 week this device will get the new 5.0 google os. so you'll have a 2015 (it's almost here) os before any other device. on top of that, you will be first in line to get any updates or bug fixes. as you look around, notice how many devices with higher prices are running 2 yr old android versions. i suggest the 32 gb because apps have grown in size and they can fill up easily esp if you add music and movies. a 90 to 120 min hd movie can take up 1 to 1.5 gb of storage. but if you can live with the 16gb, i will say its quite a steal also. pure clean android that you can build and trick out your way. you will not find another device with the quality build, screen, processor and cutting edge android software. im holding on to this gem until she gives out. (see screen shot of usable storage after unboxing and updating to 4.4.4 including a dozen app updates such as gmail, google music, maps, drive etc)"
B00DVFLJKQ,1,3,"In mobile, count the cost carefully",William Meyer,3,Yes,21-Jan-18,3,0,"Was a nice device, worked well, but with issues. Android pushed updates as though they owned the device, and that is a concern. But just three weeks before the end of the warranty, the device (rebooting after one of those updates) bricked itself. ASUS fixed it, but still... Then, a couple of months ago, I had to have the charge port replaced, because the design of the tablet does not afford adequate protection, and the shell had become deformed. Got it back ($85 later!) and the touch system was messed up. Took it in again, they reseated a cable, and that resolved the issue with the touch system, but just two days later, it bricked itself, and the service center declares it unrepairable. It was too expensive in the first place, to be so poorly supported. It has put me off ASUS, at least, for mobile devices, and the service company they license to make repairs."
B00DVFLJKQ,1,4,It was the right choice for me!,Dale K.,5,Yes,06-Mar-14,76,0,"I bought one for myself and two more for my girls that live at home,

Originally I had planned on going with the kindle fire hdx 7"" because of the faster processor and graphics card but decided against it for a few reasons.

Kindle fire hdx 7"" would be a great pick for someone deeply integrated in the Amazon ecosystem. Please do not get me wrong, I love Amazon with all my heart, that is why I buy almost everything here. It would also be a great purchase for the first time tablet user or for someone who is not very tech savvy for it has a cool feature called ""Mayday"" button that takes you to a live Amazon support individual on your tablet screen. It has good speakers if you do not plan on using headphones or ear-buds. It is also one of the only tablets that allows you to stream your free Amazon Prime videos.

-I bought a Nexus 7 2013 version because I can always have the newest version of android when it becomes available first.

-Google play has more than amazon does for apps. You can get the kindle app from Google play if you want to utilize your kindle library.

-I do not have to unlock or try to manipulate the Nexus into trying to make an app work, they just do.

-Chromecast is cool, so is Miracast that is on the Kindle. I just do not want to go out and buy a new television to be able to make Miracast work. We are PC gamers in this house so we do not have Playstations to run this through either.

-I like having a front and back camera on the Nexus. Yes if you Skype a lot maybe you will want the 720p front camera on the kindle but you do not get a rear camera on the kindle.

-The Nexus captures 1080P video, that is a cool tablet feature.

-The kindle can be set up as child friendly. The Nexus can have multiple users. When you create a user profile you can you can restrict the mature content and set what applications that user will have access to. Not to mention the numerous apps available for helping the parent monitor and restrict if you deem this necessary it is all available on googleplay.

-I like having the choice of what browser I want to use (firefox being my favorite) and I know that firefox works on just about every site. I also have the option of Google Chrome. I am not limited to just the kindle browser ""Silk"" which is not a horrible browser but I prefer knowing that when I use firefox under the right settings that I have a little privacy.

CONCLUSION:

What it boils down to is both of the tablets are great. Most of the time they are the same price. The kindle you will have to pay an additional fee if you do not want to see their adds every time you wake it up or unlock it. Most kindle users do not mind the adds and some like them. I have just found that for what I do the Nexus is a better buy for me. This is with the sacrifice of a little slower processor and video processor, I have not noticed any difference. If you are not in a huge hurry then maybe wait a little longer to see what the Nexus 8 is going to have besides a little larger screen. I believe that tablet is coming out sometime in 2014 (probably the 2nd or 3rd 1/4). Like I stated earlier I bought three of these and they are easy to set up and I have not had any problems in the last month of using them. I will gladly update this post/review if I do have any issues.

I hope this review did not confuse you or make it harder for you to make a choice, the tablet is built by ASUS as well which this in itself is a bonus in my opinion.

Thanks for reading my review

UPDATE/EDIT: 4/29/2014 Still running strong, all three of them. Love playing games on them and I love streaming Netflix in High Definition. Lots of rumors flying around out there about the Nexus 8. I still love my Nexus 7 2013 but I cannot wait to see what the next Nexus tablet has to offer.

UPDATE/EDIT: 5/4/2015 The tablets are still operating just fine. Two of the three started having problems with the charging port. The charging port begins to get loose and sloppy. It will not charge after awhile. It is not that hard to fix if you do not mind opening up the back of the tablet and working with small tools. Eventually you can only bend things back into shape so many times before it fails. I did not bother buying a charging board replacement because they are expensive and there are two versions and you need the right one. I opted for a Qi wireless charging pad that I did a review on and it works great. Besides the charging port going bad the tablets have worked perfect.

Thanks for reading my review and this update."
B00DVFLJKQ,1,5,A durable tablet indeed,Wedge,5,Yes,22-Nov-18,3,0,I have owned this tablet for five years now and I must tell you that it is pretty damn amazing! It works as expected and even outperforms several of the tablets that my brother has purchased that are newer than this one. How I wish that they would make a newer Nexus tablet but I have no qualms or issues with the one that I currently have!
B00DVFLJKQ,1,6,Nexus 7 Tablet not worth the problems.,LFlat,1,Yes,07-Jun-18,2,0,"When this tablet worked correctly, it was a pleasure to use. It fits very nicely in your hand, and has great visual quality. This is my second Nexus 7 tablet, and unfortunately both had similar problems. The first issue had to do with the tablet arbitrarily shutting down for no reason. Both tablets have this issue, and when the tablet shuts down I lose the work I have on screen. That alone is very annoying, but it also is very slow to restart. Over time the shutdowns have become more frequent, and the current tablet is now shutting down almost every time I use it. Secondly, the touch screen has been losing sensitivity, and doesn't always respond to touch. Third is an issue with recharging. Both tablets reached a point where they wouldn't recharge, although the recharging cords and connections worked fine on all my other devices. On the first tablet I ended up having the battery replaced, and this seemed to help that particular issue. It did not help, however, with the random shutdowns. I had the first tablet for close to four years, before these problems overcame its usefulness. The current tablet is barely 6 months old, refurbished, and had a one month warranty. In retrospect it would have been better to not purchase the refurbished product since I really haven't saved any money. I contacted ASUS to address my problems, but ASUS did not have any record of this refurbished device's serial number. In other words they didn't warrant a third party refurbishment. Since I did not receive any information on the refurbishment with my purchase, I couldn't follow up with that approach. A fourth issue with the current tablet is the screen brightness. The light arbitrarily dims and returns to bright. Much as I enjoy this tablet when it works, I'm going to have to find a more reliable product in the future. I like an analog system, but haven't really seen any tablets that match this device for the size and convenience."
B00DVFLJKQ,1,7,Google Nexus 7 2013 32GB Tablet vs Asus Zenpad 7c 16GB Tablet,Buckeye_Knight,4,Yes,13-Dec-16,1,0,"I purchased the 2013 Google Nexus 7 tablet refurbished in 2014. After about 15 months of daily use, the tablet was not keeping its charge well. So I purchased an Asus Zenpad 7c to replace it. Both tablets are made by Asus, but the ZenPad tablet is not quite the quality of the Nexus 7. And after about 10 months, I started having the same drop in battery time as the Nexus 7. Just in time, I found a local place that replaces cell phone and tablet batteries. For $48, I was able to get the battery replaced in my Nexus 7, so I have moved back to that tablet. The Nexus 7 is faster, has a sharper display, and better cameras. Here is a quick comparison:

Nexus 7 2013

- 2 GB RAM
- Quad-Core Snapdragon Processor
- Display Resolution: 1200x1920
- 5.0 Mega-Pixel Rear Camera
- 1.2 Mega-Pixel Forward Camera (Screen Side)
- NO micro-SD slot
- Stereo speakers (1 on each end for horizontal stereo sound)
- Android (upgraded to version 6)
- Paid: $190 Refurbished

ZenPad 7
- 16 GB Storage
- 1 GB RAM
- Quad-Core Intel Atom Processor
- Display Resolution: 1024 x 600
- 2.0 Mega-Pixel Rear Camera
- 0.3 Mega-Pixel Forward Camera (Screen Side)
- micro-SD card slot
- Stereo speakers (2 on top side)
- Android (upgraded to version 5)
- Paid: $87 New

So there are primarily 3 advantages of the ZenPad 7 over the Nexus 7:
1. micro-SD Card Slot: Expands memory (I use a 32GB card that costs between $10 and $20) that can be used on other devices.
2. Interface: Asus' ZenUI interface that runs on top of Android was much easier and flexible to use. However, there are several interfaces that can be downloaded and installed on Andriod tablets.
3. Price: Currently you can get the ZenPad tablet on Amazon for about $77 NEW. So you can buy 2-3 of these tablets versus a Nexus 7 tablet. Since the Nexus 7 is no longer manufactured, a new Nexus 7 2013 32GB tablet goes for quite a high price.

Overall, I like the Nexus 7 better, which is why I opted to have its battery replaced instead of the ZenPad. However, I really liked having the 32GB micro-SD card slot on the ZenPad. For the money, though, this Asus Zenpad 7 tablet is well worth it! But if you can get a good deal on the Nexus 7, go for it. There are micro-USB thumb drives that allow use of a micro-SD card. I use that with my Nexus 7 tablet.

I also wanted to note that my 1st tablet was the first Kindle Fire 7-inch tablet. That tablet only had 8GB storage (way too small), and most of that was earmarked for Amazon media only. This limited app and file storage quite a bit! Newer Kindle Fire tablets offer more, but I understand that they still do not allow Google Play Store. That is a major issue with me, as there are so many more apps available on the Google Play Store. Those issues being the case, I will not purchase a Kindle Fire tablet until those limitations are lifted. I can easily read my Kindle books on both the Zenpad and Nexus tablets, so no big deal there.

Enjoy!"
B00DVFLJKQ,1,8,DISSAPOINTED IN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THE PRODUCT,Annabelle Ceja,1,Yes,14-Sep-14,4,1,"I would like to say I purchased the newest Google Nexus 7 tablet (2014 model) on Feb 16 2014 as a birthday present for my daughter (Her birthday is in March). The product worked for about 3 months. My daughter brought it to me to charge because the battery had fully died. I left it to charge overnight. The tablet never turned back on. All that happened was a blinking white light. I tried using a different nexus charger I borrowed from my niece who also had a Nexus and nothing. I finally went online and found out that several others also had this issue. I tried contacting google and they stated I had to contact Amazon since I purchased it from them. They were NO HELP. Person I spoke to on the phone stated I could return the item but there was no telling what my refund would be. WHAT?!?!? I informed the person that my daughter had really enjoyed the product I just needed an exchange or for them to fix it, being that I had only purchased it a few months prior. She just kept repeating herself that Amazon would return item but no telling what I would get back until they recieved it. I tried speaking to google once again. The person I spoke with at Google also tried blaming me (or my daughter that is) for letting the tablet battery die all the way. He said you should never use the tablet until all the battery is gone. He also stated that if I sent it to their tech people to ""fix"" the problem it would be close to $200 ((WOW)) might as well buy the same product again (well actually I would never purchase a google product again). Not after this experience. Needless to say I am VERY DISSAPOINTED that Google did not stand by their product and that Amazon could not assist me any further. To this day the tablet is just sitting there with the protective case that I also bought from Amazon to protect the tablet from any damage. ***Those of you thinking about buying this product please research the issue online about the tablet not turing back on once the battery has died completely and the blinking white light.***Silly of me thinking that once you plug in the charger it should ACTUALLY CHARGE the tablet."
B00DVFLJKQ,1,9,Can't beat the price,E-J O,5,Yes,18-Feb-19,1,0,"My old 7 was broken and the digitizer wasn't working correctly so I replaced it with this inexpensive (1/3 of other offerings). I was slightly disappointed that the input mic wsn't working and called the supplier.
Excellent service told me I could send it back for full refund or I could get a discount. We opted for the discount as we use it to read books and surf the web and are patient enough to type in searches instead of using google's assistant.
I recommend this seller."
B00DVFLJKQ,1,10,and it was a wonderful little tablet for three years,Highway,4,Yes,01-Sep-16,1,0,"This is my second Nexus 2013 device. I bought a new one at Google in 2013, and it was a wonderful little tablet for three years. The only problem I had was that the touch system did not work well as delivered, and I was initially very disappointed. However, the problem straightened out over time via automatic SW upgrades. The first device died March 2016 shortly after the Marshmallow upgrade. Other people had similar problems.

I then bought a Nexus 9, which is a sweet device, and I bought another Nexus 7 from Amazon as ""used like new."" It seems clear to me that the latter had been refurbished. There was an evergreen needle wedged in one corner of the back. I was able to remove it and finish seating the cover properly.

Initially, the unit had some crazy behavior from the touch screen. I could touch on the left side of the screen and activate a link on the right side. Over time that has been resolved by software updates, more or less as for my original new unit. The touch capability on my used unit is just okay, but otherwise it is a fine device. It makes a great reader and a good backup for my main tablet, the Nexus 9. Nexus 7 battery life is good; display quality is great.

If you buy one of these, you have a whole series of historical software updates to do, and they will probably have to be done sequentially."
B00DVFLJKQ,2,11,Perhaps the best truly portable tablet ever made,Dennis Eichenlaub,5,Yes,02-Dec-15,3,0,"My Android phone died after 4 years of use. Instead of buying a new smartphone, I decided to separate the three main functions. My old pocket camera takes nicer pictures than a smart phone. A cheap flip-phone works as well and sounds as good as a smart phone. A tablet has a larger display and gives me access to my calendar and contacts. If there's Wi-Fi, it gives me access to email and the web.

There are two different Nexus 7 tablets. The 2013 model has a much better display with 1920 x 1200 resolution. Google Chrome lets me request a desktop page. The amazing display let me see everything clearly. A Minisuit Bluetooth Keyboard Case for Google Nexus 7 FHD 2nd Gen 2013 (Rubberized Non-Slip Grip) keyboard-stand-case makes it easy to use. It's all in an amazingly small package, easily fitting in my cargo pocket. It's too bad Google stopped making this tablet. Be sure and buy yours before the disappear forever."
B00DVFLJKQ,2,12,Movies on here look awesome! For the price and for the pixel geek,Nemesio C.,3,Yes,19-Mar-16,1,1,"For the person who uses an IOS device and wants an Android Tablet thats cheap but still worth the money:
The OS sometimes skips or stutters given i have used only a third of its memory.
Its fast but sometimes can take a while to open up apps when you've just started the tablet up.
Sometimes its just easier to use IOS apps for some tasks and others Google's OS/Android.
The battery is my only concern. I have used many battery life saver apps and apps that terminate apps when its sleeping and it still seems to drain when not in use. I might use it at 100% at the beginning of the day, leave it, and pick it up at the end of the day with 92%.
Its not a big deal, since what i manly use it for is to drive my plex and to watch videos. The screen is a huge PRO. Its possibly the main reason you want this tablet. Movies on here look awesome! For the price and for the pixel geek, you need this tablet.
If you want to share data across platforms, im sure you know how to do it and there are different apps that allow you to send files cross platform
The swipe across text feature is great since i sometimes wish i had it on my IOS device.
Its great for reading books - if you have the playbooks on there, you can just ask it to read it out loud if your too lazy to read like myself
All other cloud storage apps seem to work smoothly although can stutter at times.

Overall the tablet is great as a secondary device that can compliment your overall needs. Its of course secondary, so if your thinking about doing some hardcore editing docs, loading up a ton of apps, using google maps etc. this isnt for you. This is a tablet for small tasks like watching youtube, browsing the internet, checking email, movie cast lookups, news, plex etc. Also, you can torrent apps (ssshhh). The tablet is great for my needs and should be for you as well if the condition above apply."
B00DVFLJKQ,2,13,From an iDevice guy - I can't believe how much this has improved!,J. Hicks,4,Yes,27-Mar-14,4,2,"I have had an iPad 1 and 2, currently have an iPhone. When I found that I was using the phone more and more and the iPad less and less, I wanted to use a cheaper, lighted pad for reading and some tablet-y things. So I sold the iPad and got a 1st gen Nexus 7. I hated that device. It was frequently laggy, the screen flickered and it was just a displeasure to use. I sold that for a Kindle Fire, which I promptly returned. No Google Play, and the restrictions that lock it in make the Apple Universe seem liberal in comparison. I then got a refurb Nook HD which I liked very much. A good e-reader with pretty good tablet skills. I didn't like the nonsensical UI though, but because it had a microSD slot, you could add (for 10 bucks) an AndroidForNook card which allows it to dual boot CyanogenMod. I can't say enough about what a great product that was.
But I kept hearing things about the Nexus second gen tablet.
The build feels good. It is light and thin, almost feels like nothing in your hands. It is fast, no lag, no screen flicker. MKV files play absolutely smoothly and without stutter. The screen is beautiful and feels big. Page rendering on the web is fast. It has dual band wireless support.
I don't game a lot on it, but it runs a side loaded version of The Walking Dead game beautifully.

One star off for the reading experience. The screen doesn't darken as well as the Nook, and like the first gen of the Nexus, the screen is just plain old too bright in a dark room, even on the lowest setting. I shouldn't have to use Screen Filter to further darken the screen for night time use.

My other gripe is not the Nexus' per se but the OS itself. Various options are scattered throughout the Settings, and can be hard to find. It is still hard to understand in any given program what the ""Back"" navigation button will do.

I have always been comfortable with iOS devices, but even a Fanboy can have trouble justifying a device that costs twice as much as the Nexus 7. This device (and the OS, and the Play store) have matured enough that it is now a pleasure to use, and an excellent deal as well."
B00DVFLJKQ,2,14,Screen sensitivity problem,Donald E. Fulton,5,Yes,05-Jun-15,1,2,"(update 3, Apr 2016)
After a year still loving this tablet. Playing an hour or two of games daily got me though the New England winter. It's best feature I find is the excellent sound from the speakers. I'm a fan of streaming radio 'Organ Live', and organ music sounds great on this tablet. Streaming radio will play in the background of games (two sound sources add) without the play of the game being affected. My earlier problem with the screen becoming unresponsive I am now sure is not a hardware problem. It is due to system resources becoming overloaded. A power down/up reset fixes the problem every time. The Nexus 7 case by JETech is great, highly recommended, flip it up and Nexus 7 suspends. My only annoyance is that the black sound buttons, which are exactly the same color as the case, are nearly invisible and hard to find even by feel.
----------------------------------
(update 2, Oct 2015)
The problem I was having with the screen not responding reliably to touch has pretty much faded away. I think the main problem is not physical, but the response time of the OS. When the screen starts to become not fully responsive, which happens regularly after using my tablet for navigation, I just power down/up, and it nearly always it fixes the problem.
---------------------------
Screen touch sensitivity problem (update)
I have had this tablet a month now and spent many hours playing games with it, but yesterday I gave up in disgust because the screen was responding so poorly to touch. Playing Candy Crush, Temple Run and Solitaire I often had to tap the screen 5 or 10 times to get it to respond. I have the exact same games on my 7"" Nook, also an android machine, and its screen is always responsive, and the games play smoothly. I'm an engineer and I've noticed that the Nexus screen sensitivity varies from day to day, like it's sensitive to humidity or temperature or finger oils or something. Sometimes it's as sensitive as the Nook and games play cleanly, but on other days the screen ignores repeated taps and swipes with some regions of the screen being particularly bad. I've found resetting the tablet doesn't help. This is a serious problem. I've lowered my rating to two stars. It appears that Nexus in pushing the screen to very high resolution has traded off it having a reliable, robust touch sensitivity.

Tips
At first power up the home screens on my new tablet were not clean. More than half the space of the center home screen was occupied by a ""My Library' box and the home screen to the right had a large ""Recommended for"" box. To me these are just annoyances. I have not figured out how to delete them, but there is a way to minimize them and move them out of the way. I don't see any discussion of this in a search of the reviews, so I thought I would write up how to do it.

A long press on these boxes will eventually show an outline box. Play around this as it is a little tricky. The edges of the outline box can be dragged to make the boxes considerably smaller. But even better a long press on the minimized boxes will allow them to be moved to other home screens like any app icon. I moved them to the outer home screens giving me three clean center home screens for my icons.

How to hide the keyboard --- when I searched, all I found was recommendations to swipe the keyboard, but that doesn't work on my Nexus 7. What does work is hitting the left back arrow, which changes from pointing left to pointing down when the keyboard is on screen."
B00DVFLJKQ,2,15,A POCKET ROCKET! (revised),Benjamin Janssen,3,Yes,24-Nov-13,4,0,"My tablet started as 5 stars. Down to three as the days go by.

I was getting intermittent wifi drop-offs. I thought it was my elderly router.
But it happens at my local Starbucks and at my cable company's wifi hotspots all over town.
(Brighthouse/Time Warner).
I also tried insecure (no password) configurations and finally restored the Nexus 7 to factory.
Still happening, no joy.

The tablet freezes after unresponsive screen gestures in various apps. (e.g. OfficeSuite Pro 7)
Sometimes when apps crashed, I would wind up at the home screen, frozen.
Another nag is a sudden pause in Chrome where there would be a delay in responding
to entered url's. I call those ""mini-freezes.""

I returned the tablet.
A shame, since the screen is so beautiful and it's so darned quick (when it's working right).
Maybe it's a hardware problem or the KitKat OTA upgrade.
Some people think that the RAM is to blame. Rumors are that Apple cornered the market
on the high quality RAM. Again, rumors, but very plausible.

I've already owned a defective 2012, and 2013 Nexus 7, and I won't go down this road again.
What are the odds of getting a defective Nexus 7, 1st and 2nd generation on the first try?
There most certainly appears to be a problem with these tablets. That's been my experience.
And according to user groups, Asus and Google don't provide good customer support.
Do an internet search and verify this. In fact, research the heck out of this before buying!
Don't take my word for it. See for yourself.

This purchase has a high likelihood of being a time-consuming, and regrettable experience.
I cannot recommend this item to anyone in good conscience.

At least I dealt with Amazon and they cheerfully refunded my money.
That's what earned this item at least three stars.

I try so hard to avoid Apple products. These experiences make that notion difficult.

Happy holidays to all."
B00DVFLJKQ,2,16,Better than what I expected !,iajarmeh,4,Yes,30-Nov-13,4,0,"I hesitated before ordering this tablet because of the bad reviews.... finally, the price was really good so I ordered one from Amazon (32G for $229). I have been using it since 4 days and everything seems to be working as expected.... I tested the touch screen using more than one test app and I found no issues.... also I didn't encounter any touch screen issues while using the device. I do have both android as well as Apple devices so I am not biased to anyone against the other... and to be honest, I was planning to buy the ipad mini with Retina display, but I didnt like its width and I HATED ITS PRICE !!!! so I bought this Nexus for less than half the price of the ipad mini (my 32G Nexus 7 is $229 no Tax and no shipping while the 32G ipad mini is $550 including the Tax). I do believe that the ipad is more stable, more mature, looks nicer, and will out-perform this Nexus, but honestly for half the price I highly recommend this Nexus 7 .... I like this device: display is beautiful, performance is good (I updated to 4.4), and battery life is excellent.

I am giving 4 starts because I believe that Asus should have done a little better job by reducing the huge top/bottom bezel or at least provide capacitive buttons and probably front speakers on this huge bezel in case if they decided to keep its size as is...

I will update this review in case if I encounter any issues...."
B00DVFLJKQ,2,17,Best 7-inch pure android tablet,June,5,Yes,09-Dec-13,5,0,"NOTE: When I first bought this product, the power button stopped working after the first two weeks. I initiated a replacement with Amazon and got my new one 2 days later. I am very pleased with Amazon's fast and painless return/replacement process.

Now onto the actual device.
Pros:
-Beautiful Screen
-Pure android 4.4 (at the time of this writing)
-Slim design
-Fast processor makes graphics and games look great
-No hiccups in or sluggishness in UI

Cons:
-Hiss in the audio. Most noticeable at low volumes. (FIXED w/ Android 4.2.2 update)
-Battery life can drain quickly in idle. I would recommend completely shutting it down when you know you won't use it for more than 6 hours.
-Power button on my last one broke but the new one is doing fine.

Summary: This is a great little android tablet if you can get over the minor issues.

EDIT: As of the newest over the air update the audio hiss is now gone! Thanks Google!"
B00DVFLJKQ,2,18,"May be ""old"" in digital years, but still a superb small tablet.",Amazon Customer,5,Yes,05-Dec-15,2,0,"Second Nexus 7 (gen 2) that I own. Purchased to replace a gen1 Nexus 7 used by another family member. Despite its ""old age"" in digital years, it is still an excellent tablet and smoothly upgraded to the latest Android version over the air (it was several versions behind as delivered, so you do need to do the upgrades to get to the latest versions, which does take some time with all the app updates also required). Perfect size for reading and especially travel due to long battery life and modest size and weight. Runs all apps I have tried, including mapping (OpenStreetMap and Here) with sufficient memory to download multiple country maps (some with full terrain contour maps) for travel. GPS can be a little slow to start up after moving long distances, but is quite precise and easily used for both rural and in-city navigation. A solid product."
B00DVFLJKQ,2,19,Giant powerhouse without compromised price,Charles Spanky,5,Yes,21-Jan-14,2,0,"I've owned this tablet for about 4 months now, and I believe I have a good grasp of it. Out of the box, you get the tablet, an AC charger, and a micro USB cable. The AC charger is superior to the Nexus 7 2012 charger, because it is smaller, square, and doesn't fall off the wall charger like it'd predecessor. The micro USB cable is the same as the Nexus 2012 charger, which are light and sleek, but my micro USB connector has popped out of the plastic a few times, which is an easy fix to snap back in, but is tedious when it happens.

Hardware:
The tablet itself is very light, which is nice if you want to hold it in one hand, but it is large enough to play android games comfortably. When the Tablet originally came out, people were having touch troubles with the screen, but that has since been resolved, and there hasn't been any major issues. This tablet is 7 inches, which is big enough to not strain your eyes when looking at the screen, but small enough to fit snugly in my pockets. The screen of the tablet is an 1900x1200 IPS display, which means that it can go anywhere with sunlight and still be clearly seen, and to see the smallest of details that most tablets for this price skimp. This is great for reading books or playing games outside. There are three hard buttons on the right side of the tablet: Power, Up and Down, and three soft buttons: Back, Home, and Multitask. This device has 2gb of Ram and a snapdragon S4 1.5ghz processor which makes multitasking very easy, and apps smooth. This Nexus has a front and rear (5MP) camera which is a great improvement over its predecessor. The stereo speakers allow you to hear clearly when playing music or videos without needing headphones. Hardware wise, this tablet is great, light, and powerful.

Update 1/22/14:
People that has reviewed this product has said that the fact that no micro sd card slot was a major negative. Although this is correct, you can add an OTG (On the Go) cable to this tablet and it will work fine. From there, you have to decide if you want to root your tablet or not.

My recommendation for which one to buy is from Meenova (not sold on amazon). They sell a ""Mini MicroSD Card Reader"" which is used on my Nexus 7. Unfortunately, they do not have a store on Amazon yet, so you'll have to Google it.

I am not affiliated any way with the above people, but I will definitely say that my 64gb micro SDHC card works great with Poweramp, and every emulator I've used.

Software:
This tablet is backed by Google Play, which is a great platform for free apps, and the paid apps are great. If you can think of an app, Google play probably has a free version with ads, great for students like myself trying to use a tablet on a budget.

Overall:
I use this tablet every single day. As a music player, a grocery list, a game console. I take it wherever I go, and I'd probably be lost without it. I would recommend this tablet to anyone who is interested in a tablet, especially at its price point @ $269 when I bought it, and deals are constantly online for much less.

Pros:
+ Price is great compared to similar tablets.
+ Screen size is large but portable
+ 1900x 1200 IPS screen enables to see tablet wherever you are without seeing pixels
+ 2gb Ram and Snapdragon S4 processor for easy multitasking
+ Backed by Google Play's market.
+ Front and Rear cameras

Cons:
- Charger cord's connector sometimes comes loose, requires plastic to be reattached."
B00DVFLJKQ,2,20,Weak Asus Warranty,Wolf Walterson,1,Yes,02-Jul-14,2,1,"After ten months of use my Nexus 7 FHD quit working—blank screen—kaput. It was still under warranty but Asus would not honor it because I could not give them the serial number, which is supposedly on the long ago discarded box as well as on the inside of the device. Opening the device voids the warranty. One customer service representative gave the ‘okay’ to honor the warranty once I sent in my receipt of purchase, which I did, and was rewarded with a ‘no warranty coverage’ due to no serial number. They said an RMA number would be generated.

When I called I was again told there would be a charge. The customer service representative refused to let me speak with their manager or anyone else for that matter. I was chastised for not keeping the ‘box.’ I don’t know if the serial number was on or in the box, or not, but perhaps if it was, they should have placarded it: Do Not Throw Away Your Empty Box For One Year! – You Will Need It When The Product Fails! – As if we’re all supposed to save the empty packaging from every purchase when the receipt should be sufficient.

So, awaiting a charge to repair my much needed Nexus for, what is in my opinion, an expensive device that should have lasted more than ten months as well as honored by the warranty by my proof of purchase, I have been trading their delaying-tactics emails awaiting them to generate an RMA number to send in the device. It has been a month since this began and I still have neither an RMA number nor a repair station address to send it to. I get the feeling they are deliberately dragging their feet until the warranty year expires because once they open it the serial number will stare them in the face.
At this point I just want the thing fixed. I should not have to run out and buy another like a disposable butane lighter.

When the device was working I came to depend on it for my business as well as for my work as an aviator. I enjoyed the recreational benefits as well, and fully expected Asus to keep their written word agreement, which has turned out to be worthless. I should not have to buy two devices in order to have a backup when one fails. I suspect that the Nexus is normally a quality electronic device and that I got a ‘lemon,’ but I don’t know. If the Asus Nexus is built with low quality parts, then the price should be a lot less, since their customer service is poor, their warranty is weak, and their product reliability is inferior.

My recommendation is to not buy Asus products without purchasing a good insurance program from an outside source."
B00DVFLJKQ,3,21,A Great Experience With An EXCELLENT Tablet.,Lawrence Lomenzo,5,Yes,04-Feb-14,2,0,"I've had this tablet since January 8, 2014 and I have been loving it since day one! Set up was a breeze. Once I signed into my pre-existing Google account, my email, contacts and calendar were synced almost instantly and without a hitch or a glitch. Therefore, getting organized was a snap! Even the latest operating system update was pushed to my device almost as fast. So, I will assume that prior glitches, as reported elsewhere here, were resolved with the latest update that was pushed to me. Because, happily, I have no such glitches or problems to report. NOTE: My personal Nexus 7 2013 is WIFI only. However, there are, or will be, units coming out soon that are both WIFI and 4G LTE compatible. Perhaps even by the time you read this.

There are two things I'd like to point out here. This tablet is fragile. So, save yourself some worry and buy a good case (with or without a stand) and a pack of screen protectors to go with this. Also, I am an avid eBook reader who, prior to getting this, used a Kindle Paperwhite to read with. Moving eBooks from Kindle to Nexus 7 2013, to read, can be a bit tricky. However, it is really not difficult. Simply sync Google drive (or Dropbox) to the Nexus 7. Then, download Moon Reader eBook reader from the Play Store (There are two versions, free and paid, available. The free version should do nicely for most people) Put any books you'd like to read into the Google Drive (or Dropbox) folder on your PC. Then, on the Nexus 7, select Moon Reader, then My Files, then GDrive (Google Drive) or Dropbox. You will then see a list of the books you put in the folder on your PC. Simply tap the name of the book you want, from the list on the Nexus 7, and it will automatically upload to the Nexus and be ready to read. As I said, tricky, yes. But, the process does get easier once you've done it a time or two. I highly recommend this tablet to anyone. Buy with confidence and enjoy!"
B00DVFLJKQ,3,22,"Can't Turn it On, Can't Charge",Ricky L.,1,Yes,05-Oct-16,4,1,"I purchased this last year, and it broke down this year. One year of life for a $250+ device is not acceptable. Now, I will say that when it worked, it did was it was suppose to do, and functioned as a decent tablet. However, eventually, it started to be unable to charge, no matter what charger I used. I used my adapter that connects to an outlet. I used the charger that charges via USB from the computer. Neither worked to charge the device, which were both able to charge this device the past year. My chargers still work to charge my other Android devices. It just can't charge this thing. At the end of its life, all I could do was watch its power drain

Since it doesn't charge, I can't turn it on. It's basically a brick. $250+ down the drain."
B00DVFLJKQ,3,23,"LOVE the Google Nexus - best 7 inch tablet on the market -beats the iPad mini by a long shot (if you aren't in the apple ""cult"")",Katie,5,Yes,01-Jan-14,2,0,"Sorry, but I am a Windows user through and through --- Bill Gates was a visionary who wanted affordable computers ""in every home and on every desk"", Steve Jobs wanted rich people to join a cult of Apple products only. Well Google teaming up with Android and Asus to build their tablet was one of the best things to happen in the tablet industry. I use my tablet for everything, it has a camera on the front for Skyping or for Conference Calls which is fantastic. It is set up just like an Android phone so it is very familiar to use if you have an Android phone. The HD screen resolution is the best in the market - it even beats the Apple iPad mini. The wide edges on the top and bottom of the tablet are great for viewing videos (or anything when you have the tablet horizontal) because you can hold on to the edges without blocking any of the screen. The best part, is if you have a Gmail account - you can use your Google Drive to always be able to access your documents without having to store them on the tablet, so really the amount of memory on your tablet isn't a huge factor in its ability to accomplish what you need. I am a tech geek, and I work in the Information Technology Industry (at UPS in software development), and I can assure you that more and more things will be stored in the cloud instead of physically stored on your device, don't be fooled by other tablets who claim to have much more memory as if you need it; it really doesn't matter. The Nexus7 (2013) also updates it's software and operating system automatically so you will not be stuck with an old operating system and need to buy a new tablet. I plan on buying one of these for my sister for school because of how useful it is. I can't wait to see what Google comes out with next."
B00DVFLJKQ,3,24,Best budget tablet,Raul Velasquez,5,Yes,23-Nov-14,1,0,"When this came out it was the best tablet for you could get for such small amount of money, sure there are tons of cheap tablets, but besides the Amazon Fire models, they're all expensive paperweights that will hinder your Android experience.

You get pretty decent hardware and a stock android experience that will always get updates fresh from the oven (currently waiting for Android 5.0 Lollipop), basically any apps and games run smoothly, and the screen is gorgeous! The only con is camera quality, but nobody buys a tablet to use it as a camera.

I have a smartphone, desktop computer and this, so for me tablet is more like a leisure device, light browsing, random games and watching movies, which is where this thing shines. As said screen quality is astonishing for the price, you can really teel this where Google/Asus put their money.

Build quality feels solid (as with any Asus product), but over the time the plastic on the side might chip (I'm a dropper who really mistreats his devices) but without causing any real damage. Also, apparently is not that uncommon to get dead pixels (black or red spots on the screen), which don't guarantee you a replacement from Google unless it is too big or too centered. Mine got a red spot, but you can only see it against solid black backgrounds.

If you're looking for a cheap tablet this is for you, dead pixel and all I feel it is well worth the money spent if you just want it for casual use or even for children."
B00DVFLJKQ,3,25,My Nexus 7 32gb (2013) was to replace the first gen N7 that i dropped and broke the screen,Vance Jochim,4,Yes,18-Apr-14,2,0,"Initially, finger presses on the screen didn't always work, but then that problem disappeared. I keep adding capabilities as I find out about them. I use if for Evernote, playing Pandora music while reading Kindle or a physical book. I also transfer Word files as backup for meetings I go to, and have to read them in Kindle or as a pdf file. I did have to find a file manager utility so I could find the files on it. I also have several alarm clocks, news sites, weather apps, Pomodora timers, an audio recorder (for meetings),

The biggest pain is that GOOGLE produces the N7, so they force you to use a gmail account to register it, but then also force your account to register as a G+ account. So things get screwed up because I DO NOT WANT TO USE OR WORK WITH GOOGLE PLUS, and I resent being forced to. For instance, apps ask you to rate them, but it requires logging in to Google Plus to enter the rating, so I decline. Then the damn things keep asking for a rating every few days. GOOGLE is screwing the usefullness of Android by forcing people to use Google +. But, once I learn to avoid such obnoxious requests, the N7 is still very usefull. A limitation is the lack of add on SD card memory. So I don't use if for anything that is memory intensive."
B00DVFLJKQ,3,26,Disappointed that it was no better than an iPad,WindGuy,3,Yes,13-Oct-14,1,0,"I had been using an iPad for a couple of years but was about to lose the company-supplied device when I retired. There are many things I hated about the iPad and I dislike Apple for their totalitarian policies, so I decided to try the Nexus 7 because friends had recommended it.

Unfortunately, there are also many things I hate about the Nexus 7. Like the iPad, I spend half of my composing time editing the millions of mistakes I make because of the miserable touch screen. Something I can fix on a Real Computer (TM) with little effort using a keyboard and mouse are a pain on the Nexus 7 (and iPad too). It's also too small to use on my lap and almost too big to hold comfortably in one hand. It should be either bigger or smaller. I do like that I can stick it in my back pocket, but I almost never need to do that.

As a result of this disappointment, instead of buying a Samsung Galaxy 5 to replace the iPhone I was about to lose, I held my nose and bought another iPhone. I figured I knew the iPhone and it's quirks well enough, so I decided to stick with the devil I knew.

Other than the size issue, my complaint is really more of an indictment of tablets in general. I've been using PCs for decades and I hate how my productivity plummets when using a tablet. I would never try to write this review on the Nexus 7. I just don't have an hour to spare for correcting typos. They are useful for playing simple games, and are also useful when needing to access email, Facebook, and do simple web browsing in situations where a PC is not practical."
B00DVFLJKQ,3,27,Still the best tablet!,Suzi Jones,5,Yes,26-Feb-18,-,0,"I have owned a Nexus 7 2012 previously. I bought it new through Gamestop (for the replacement warrenty), but unfortunately Gamestop doesn't carry tablets in the two stores near me.

I bought a samsung tab E lite this past fall and have HATED it ever since!!! I finally got fed up enough (and saved enough money) to buy another Nexus.

I researched the product reviews on tablets and the Nexus seven is STILL the best!

I'm soo glad I bought it!! I haven't had it drop my wi-fi connection since I got it!! The screen resolution is AMAZING!

It's as good as I remember. Soo glad I got another one!"
B00DVFLJKQ,3,28,Just as awesome as the original and you get a clearer screen (kids tablet as well),Andy M,5,Yes,10-Mar-14,1,0,"We also have one of the Nexus 7 original version tablets. Definitely worth paying extra to get one of these new ones with the higher resolution screen. No more scrolling side to side to view the whole webpage. This one was purchased for our 2yr old who mainly uses it for watching Netflix cartoons. We can just hand him the tablet and he can unlock it and open/navigate Netflix himself. He also uses it for some kids apps. My wife and I will also use from time to time.

My wife was originally going to purchase one of those $100 kids tablets at the store that you have to pay an additional $20 for each cartridge. She put it back when I told her we should buy him a Nexus 7 and get free apps. This is also used by her sometimes and she loves it. My son uses this way-way more than he ever would have used that $100 tablet.

Also bought this case to complete the ""kids tablet"" look and I definitely recommend this if it fits your application.....(i-Blason ArmorBox Kido Series for Google New Nexus 7 2 II)

Update 7/24/2014: Like the tablet very much. My 2yr old did drop it once as he was trying to put it up on the counter and it locked up. Held down power button for 30 seconds and it rebooted with no problems. He is rough with it and that is the only time it had a slight issue so I am happy with quality. I bought another because my 2yr old does not want to share (Netflix cartoon addiction). My wife now has her own. Now we have 3 and all are still working as they did on day 1. If you are in the market for a small tablet, i do recommend you consider this one."
B00DVFLJKQ,3,29,Once I got past the installation and no documentation nightmare; I fell in love with this tablet,Kathleen San Martino,4,Yes,02-Jan-15,-,1,"I purchased this at the end of July 2014 along with:

Google Nexus 7 2013 Case - Poetic Google Nexus 7 2013 Case [Slimline Series] - [Lightweight] [Ultra-slim] PU Leather Slim-Fit Trifold Cover Stand Folio Case for Google Nexus 7 2nd Gen 2013 Black (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic)

Stylus, amPen® Hybrid Stylus (Black) for Apple iPad Air/iPad 2/iPad Mini, Apple iPhone 6 (4.7)/6 Plus (5.5)/5/5s/5c/4s, Nexus 5/7, Galaxy Tab 4/3/2, Galaxy S5/S4, HTC One M8/M7 (Interchangeable Hybrid Tip Feature).

I also ordered the Google Nexus 7 (Android 4.4 KitKat Edition) book as a compliment to this purchase.

I waited almost six months to write this review because I wanted to ""cool off"" from my installation experience that would have caused me to rate this 3 stars. I am also now able to fairly assess this tablet after a few months' use.

I wanted a highly-rated unrestricted (open) tablet that provided great graphics and sufficient screen space. I purchased this to use on a Wi-Fi network only for when I didn't want to boot up my laptop to check mail or see a movie, etc. I also did not want an Apple tablet because my boyfriend has an iPad 3 and the Apple products have restrictions. I also was not impressed with the graphics on his iPad. I was considering a Kindle Fire HD 7"" but that tablet was too restrictive as well and was geared to Amazon junkies. I am an Amazon junkie but I also do not like restrictions on products I purchase. During my July 2014 research, I discovered that the Nexus 7 tablet was the highest rated Android next to those more restrictive tablets.

After I received the Nexus, I wondered if I had made the right decision. First, I was surprised that this came with no documentation (other than the business card sized diagram of where all the ports were and a warranty and safety agreement in both English and French). The documentation didn't even say how long I needed to charge the unit. I charged it overnight and then had immense trouble getting this connected.

The router I was connecting to has MAC filtering enabled so I needed the MAC address. However, I couldn't get the MAC address without setting up the device. Also, I couldn't set it up because I couldn't get the MAC address. I could have fussed with the router and turned off MAC filtering/security temporarily but I had to get to work in the morning right after the unit completed charging. I then tried connecting via three other networks (my library for one, my work another, and another Wi-Fi connection). It still would not connect. Because I didn't want to wait until I got home 12 hours later to fuss with my router I wound up asking a tech support person where I work. He connected me via his personal MiFi mobile hotspot.

Apparently, Google Nexus only connects to certain networks if the first time setup has not been done. I tried several open networks. My co-worker's MiFi mobile network connection, although I suspect mine would have connected had I temporarily removed the security on my router, was the only one that would allow me to run the automatic setup so that I could connect. After setup was performed, I was able to get the MAC address from the settings ""about"" tab. I was also able to connect to the three other networks I tried previously and after inputting the MAC address, I could also connect to my router. It was apparently the initial setup process that prevented the connection.

This Google Nexus would have gotten five stars if they enhanced the user experience by:
1 - Providing a MAC address either on the unit or on a piece of paper for those that have MAC filtering enabled.
2 - Providing a documentation pamphlet with the unit that:
* Tells the user how long they need to charge the unit the first time.
* Explains to the user that setup cannot be run on all networks and sometimes they will get an error message. Therefore, they might say something like ""using your own network is advisable"" or provide an explanation of why certain networks (including totally open ones that allow all connections) would not work. Perhaps there is some sort of technical protocol that is not available on all networks; I have no idea.

Other than the above, I absolutely love my Google Nexus. I've been using this for almost 6 months and it has met my every expectation. It charges in less than four hours; lasts about 3 hours if I'm constantly using it; lasts about 3-4 days when I'm using it for about 10 minutes daily. I've used this for email, movies, web surfing, pictures, etc. App availability is unending (Kindle, LinkedIn, Battery Doctor, etc., etc.) I tested the screen image next to my co-workers Kindle Fire HD 7"" and there is no discernible difference in quality or resolution. Images and movies on this device are superb. If I attach my APLWL USB 2.0 A to Micro B Cable 6FT-TPE jacket-Blue to my laptop, I can both charge the unit and also access files on it from my laptop such as the photos located under Nexus 7\Internal storage\DCIM\Camera directory (that's Computer\Nexus 7\Internal storage\DCIM\Camera in Explorer).

Overall this is a quality tablet that did not disappoint me once I got past the initial installation and lack of documentation headache. In the comments section of my review, I put links to Google documentation I found helpful as well as to the 2014 review I used for my research.

UPDATE Jan 6, 2015 - Right after I wrote this review I had a problem where my Nexus was shutting down automatically and every time I went to use it I had to power it back up. After doing an Internet search I was able to fix this by going to the Play Store app on the Nexus, then selecting ""My Apps"" and accepting all install updates. There were a few updates that had not installed and this was playing havoc with my system. After I did this, the Nexus remained powered up and has been working fine the last several days."
B00DVFLJKQ,3,30,New to the big bad tablet world,LBF,5,Yes,28-Apr-14,1,0,"I shopped and shopped till my eyes popped out of my head. It was hard because I'm SO not techy, so I didn't really know what to look for. But I got pointers from hither and thither, and finally decided this would be suitable to my needs. Then I found out from a few highly respected computer-head friends of mine that this is one of the best tablets out there. Schweet. I gave myself points for that, though I'm still nothing even vaguely resembling a techy.
Anyway, I saved and saved all my pennies till I finally could get it! Of course, I wanted the 32GB as opposed to the 16 since it doesn't have external memory (one downside. I will get over it. Yay cloud storage, too) and I think that will last me a while, since I'm not planning on downloading fifty gazillion aps and whatnot. I mostly wanted it for school, and I think it will serve its purpose well.
Not having had a tablet before, and having only occasionally used similar technology in the past, I dont' really have much to relate it to... I actually had to re-order this because within the first week or so the power button stopped working. Obviously manufacture defect. But replacing it was a cinch. But it seems to be good. Reasonably fast and all that. Since I put a protective case/screen protector on, it is occasionally difficult to hit buttons (especially on the edge grrrr) which is frustrating, but I understand that is a common problem with touchscreen tech.... or maybe I'm just that tech-challenged. Whatevs.
So all that to say, I am satisfied with the fruits of all my saving-labors (not to be confused with labor-savings, mind you) and hope to get a lot of use out of this puppy (woof!)."
B00DVFLJKQ,4,31,I am loving this tablet!,Alex Schroeder,5,Yes,23-Aug-14,1,0,"This tablet is absolutely amazing. I got this as a Christmas gift and have been using it every day since. I have not had a single issue with it so far, and I have owned this for eight months. Here are some comments on the basics:

The operating system: Google Android version 4.4.4 KitKat
This system works fast, efficiently, and smoothly. I am notified whenever the latest Android version is out and am able to update my system for free.

Memory: Yes, this is a 32 GB, however the programs that come on the tablet take up some space, so you have 26.41 GB to work with. It is definitely enough space for me, since I don't download any videos or movies. I don't use my tablet to keep all of my music, either. I really just use this for apps, surfing the web, some gaming. If you are using your tablet for those things, this is more than enough space. If you plan on keeping music and movies on it, though, I'd look for one with more space.

Screen size: 7-inch. The screen is a rectangle, making it really great for surfing the web in portrait position and viewing images, videos, and games in landscape mode. At first, the extreme rectangle screen was a little hard to get used to because I had been using my mother's tablet, which was more of a square-shape. Now that I am used to my tablet, I really do like it. I have no complaints.

Screen resolution: The screen has a 1920×1200 pixel display (323 pixels per inch; 127 ppcm). It can play video in HD, although I find that when on the YouTube app it has a difficult time playing HD. Apps like Netflix play just fine with a great picture. Everything looks great and crystal clear.

WiFi Connectivity: 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz This has the most complete WiFi connectivity, which makes large downloads a snap.

Cameras: 1.2-MP front-facing 720p video recording, 5.0-MP rear-facing f2.4 AF, 1080p video recording. A big reason I got this tablet over the 2012 tablet is because of the dual cameras. The cameras work just fine. They are not that great, but the point of a tablet isn't to take professional photos and videos. When the tablet is held completely still, some pictures actually turn out very nicely. I was surprised. The videos that can be taken are low-quality, but the mic picks up a lot of sound. I did not buy this tablet for good quality pictures and videos, so I am happy with them.

Speakers: Stereo Speakers, 5.1 surround sound. I watch Netflix, YouTube videos, listen to music, etc. on this tablet, and the sound is surprisingly good! You don't get much bass action in the music, but that is what headphones are for. You can't expect that from such small speakers. I am very happy with the quality of the sound that comes out of those little things.

Inputs and Outputs: SlimPort and headphone jack. The micro USB connector works great. I have connected my tablet to my laptop, and have successfully transported files. The headphone jack works well, too. I have listened to music on headphones and on my stereo via an aux in cord.

Battery Life: I don't know the exact amount of battery life that I get, but I know that I get more than enough! I use my tablet a lot throughout the day. I mainly surf the web, play games on apps, and occasionally watch YouTube and Netflix videos. I find that I can do whatever I want and how much of it I want in a day and the battery will be at about 50%, lower when I watch videos. I charge my tablet every night to preserve battery life. The battery will drain much faster with bluetooth and location on. I keep both off unless I am using them. I am very happy with the battery life. Taking good care of the battery helps, so do some research on how to care for lithium ion batteries and how often you should be charging them.

Bottom line: I am in love with this tablet and would recommend it to anyone seeking one out."
B00DVFLJKQ,4,32,"Over a Year After Release, Still the Best Small Android Tablet.",RPB,5,Yes,07-Nov-14,-,0,"I've owned my copy of the Nexus 7 2013 for over a year and there is nothing on the market that I would take over this tablet. It's extremely portable, fitting in an inside suite jacket pocket, or even in a front pants pocket (though sitting down with it there would not be recommended). You can hold it for over an hour in one hand with no fatigue. The screen is extremely high resolution, with a full HD screen packed into 7 inches. You cannot distinguish pixels at all. It's just beautiful. The performance is very fast. There is really no lag at all with this tablet, even with a processor that's now 3 generations old. The sound is excellent, with stereo speakers that had good loudness. The network connectivity is great. I easily get 50Mbs up and down on the Wi-Fi - More than enough to stream full HD video or load the most intricate web pages. Being a Nexus, you get the latest Android updates directly from Google. 5.0 Lollipop will be out for it within the next week or two and Google will probably support it with Android upgrades for at least another year or more. I use mine for web surfing, YouTube, streaming video from my church when I'm traveling, Netflix, taking notes, reading, audio books, music, watching movies on the plane, games, stock trades, managing my bank account, buying stuff on Amazon, email, video chat, and more. Whatever you're looking to do, you can do it on this device. If you're looking for a compact, portable tablet, this one is highly recommended."
B00DVFLJKQ,4,33,Great Tablet but Beware that If you have certain android apps through Amazon you may want to check this out and do some homework,Kenn,5,Yes,12-Feb-15,1,0,I purchased this tablet a few weeks ago and it is the best tablet that I have owned. It is everything that I needed in a tablet. It has great color and vivid contrast. It has enough storage for me for a tablet and runs fast and quickly to open pages. I have several apps downloaded and it hasn't given me one hiccup maybe if i decided to go crazy on how many apps that I install on it but reasonably it works well. One thing that I would advise anyone that has had an Android phone or Android tablet and have purchased or downloaded certain free android apps is that some android apps like Amazon App Store or Amazon Prime videos and others won't download to this Nexus tablet. There are several of the same apps from Amazon that you can get through Google Play but don't order this if you want to use your Amazon Prime on it because Google and Amazon are at odds after Amazon decided to only offer their prime videos on their Fire brand tablets.Not having the ability to instal memory to a SD card may be another thing to keep in mind but the 32 GB internal memory is quite a bit and works for me. There may be a way to backdoor the Amazon apps somehow but for the normal user you may want to stay clear if you are all gung ho on these apps that I mentioned or have spent tons of coin on your apps from Amazon.
B00DVFLJKQ,4,34,Still the best tablet you can buy!,calcikid56,5,Yes,22-Aug-16,-,0,"Absolutely in love with this tablet. I have had it over 2 years and have had no problems with it. It's fast, has a beautiful display, etc.- everything you could want in a tablet. I love the size, I have small hands and it's easy to hold. I have a protective case on it so it is a little bigger and it's easier to grip with the case. I haven't had any of the charging port problems but I'm very careful inserting it so I hope it stays that way. The battery does not seem to have degraded and I charge it just about every day, however I rarely let it go below 60% before I charge it. I've been looking at newer tablets but I just can't justify spending the money when this still works so well. One of the things I love the most is that it's pure android and the only tablet out there that is. I have about 100 apps loaded and I've only used about 50% of the storage, however I don't have many photos or a lot of music stored. If the price goes down I would buy another one to have as a spare for when this poops out but it's held it's value so well that it's now $175 more than I paid for it."
B00DVFLJKQ,4,35,Problem Freezing Up,Chris W.,2,Yes,13-Oct-13,3,0,"Was a little bit disappointed in this Nexus 7. The main issue was the device would periodically freeze up. You would have to use the power button to restart the device. Two other irritating issues: 1) The edges of the device are not rounded, but instead are pointed with a 90 degree angle making holding the device annoying. Not sure why they would design a device that people are going to hold by the edges (with one hand) and not make the edges rounded. Sigh. 2) There's a full INCH of space above and below the screen for some weird reason. Why? As I'm looking at the screen I'm just thinking, why is 2 full inches of this device wasted with empty space.

So I returned this for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, 8 inch. I just like the Samsung design better. The device has rounded edges, no wasted space, a physical ""home"" button, microSD card expansion. It may not be quite as powerful or have as good a resolution as the Nexus, but who cares, the drawbacks of the Nexus aren't worth those benefits in my opinion."
B00DVFLJKQ,4,36,Best 7' tablet by far,SR,5,Yes,05-Jan-14,3,0,"I consider myself an iWorld person, and I have owned and used every iPhone since iPhone 2. I also owned the original iPad, the iPad 3 and 4. On the Android side of things, I have owned a Motorola Xoom, a Samsung S3 (rooted), a cheap Taiwan knockoff. My experience with Android hasn't been very good, and my main gripes are:

- Android ecosystem is not as good as iOS, especially apps
- Android gives you that flexibility to do with your device whatever you wanted, but in return, it is easier for malware to creeping, and software problems can be very painful. All of my Android devices have suffered from device frequent reboots that can only be solved by factory reset

Recently I bought Nexus because I was looking for a 7' tablet but didn't feel like an iPad mini. Compared this against Samsung and finally settled on this because of the stellar reviews and cheap price.

Love:

- device is light and so portable
- battery life is the best amongst all devices I have used so far. The fact that it is WiFi only means that it doesn't use battery as much as LTE devices, but bottom line is that there is no complains in the battery section
- smooth as butter. As good as any iDevice, if not better, and by far the best in Android device that I have used and tested in stores (that includes most Samsung devices, Sony and Asus)
- stable: though I load many of the same software that has caused problems with my other Androids, I have experienced no crashes. I was more careful this time, given my bad experience with Android, but it is still a lot of software loaded. So far so good
- better integrated: data sharing between apps is just so much better than iDevices
- screen: very nice and crisp. One of the best if not the best
- sound: very good for a tablet, and surprisingly loud too
- camera: didn't really try - never believed in taking photos using tablet
- charging: fast. More than what it takes to charge iPhones but nowhere near iPads
- cheap for its specs: compared to Samsung and iPad

Gripes:
- almost all Android devices support SD expansion card, and it is also a strong plus point compared to iDevice, so I consider Nexus omission of one a big negative point
- I still think the iOS app ecosystem superior

Nevertheless, the Nexus has replaced the iPad as my primary device"
B00DVFLJKQ,4,37,Highly Convenient,Jay Busari,5,Yes,14-Jan-14,1,0,"I've used this Nexus 7 for over 3 months now, and I am still very happy with this device no matter what other tablets keep coming on the market.

I put a matt (anti-glare) screen protector...and I can read PDFs in most outdoor+indoor lighting conditions.

Fits in my back pocket, handy while out on the golf course.

The battery lasts long enough (at least 20 hrs) even while connected on WiFi.

I use the Nexus 7 almost like a computer (except that I'm still not comfortable with touch screen keyboards).

I got the 32 GB version.
Too bad you can't put in an SD Memory Card, but USB on-the-go works pretty well for external storage access.
I'm still not able to use this with a mobile-data-card to use over 3G (but here's a possible work around I still need to try [...] )
Even so, I do not need 24 hr internet on this tablet (I got an LG G2 smartphone for calls and 3G that can be shared with the Nexus 7).
So the battery on both devices (Nexus 7 and LG G2) last me the whole day.

I needed to root the device to customise it further. Rooting it, when connected to a Linux machine, was very easy.

My only gripe is that the hardware power button is too near the volume control buttons."
B00DVFLJKQ,4,38,"Great tablet, weird packaging, arrived with dead battery.",R(k),5,Yes,24-Aug-14,1,0,"I had the original Nexus 7 and it died. I liked it so much I bought the newest version. I still love it. It's faster than the original, the battery lasts longer (even when using Google Now as the launcher), and it feels thinner and lighter.

The only two complaints I have are related to its arrival.

First, the packaging.
It's like someone said ""How can we make the packaging SO disappointing that the buyer will question why they even bought this?"" I'm pretty sure this is actually Amazon's doing, but why I have no idea. Mine came in a plain (as in no markings at all save for a barcode label) brown cardboard box. I would have thought I was shipped a refurbished unit had I not seen ""new"" on the barcode label. Opening the box I was treated to the most underwhelming unboxing experience ever. Inside the tablet was secured to another piece of cardboard by way of a plastic sheet stretched over it. The charger was wound and secured with a twist tie in a separate compartment. That's it. No paperwork, no manual, no bags, no buzz, no excitement, no mystery.

Second, it arrived dead.
I don't know about you, but every time I've purchased a device, it arrived with at least a little charge so you can turn it on and have that little sense of wonderment and joy. No joy here. In fact, trying to power it on resulted in 5 blinks of the notification light. After the plain box, I was sure this was a sign I had been screwed and shipped a DOA refirb. Googling the blinks didn't help, in the Nexus community there's actually an acronym for this: FBoD or Five Blinks of Death. In every case I encountered in forum after forum this mean the tablet was dead, until I finally found a single post that said this is how the Nexus reacts when you try to power it on but the battery is too low. SO... if you get one, and you get the FBOD out of the box, do what I did and just plug it in for 30 minutes.

After the initial arrival, I haven't has a single problem. Love it."
B00DVFLJKQ,4,39,Great Tablet or the Greatest Tablet?,regularjoe,5,Yes,23-Feb-14,2,0,"This thing is incredibly light weight, insanely sharp display and the battery life is superb.

I shopped around a long while before buying this tablet. The only others with strong comparable features were over $100 more when I made the purchase.

Combined with the the Bluetooth Keyboard & Leather Portfolio Case (available under $30 on Amazon http://amzn.com/B00E9QDP0I) it turns this handy tablet basically into a full feature laptop.

In conjunction with the keyboard/case mentioned, I use this tablet almost daily in the following ways:
- At work for taking notes in meetings, email, calendar, etc. [Outlook, OneNote, and Google Drive make work easy]
- At home or on the go:
** Watching movies I've downloaded or streaming live through NetFlix or HBOGO.
** Reading Kindle Books using the Kindle App.
** Playing games (Fantastic color depth)
** Listening to Music (iHeart Radio, TuneIN radio, Pandora, etc.)

Very happy I made the purchase."
B00DVFLJKQ,4,40,Still a Leading-Edge Device after a Couple of Years in the World,Bokononer,5,Yes,06-Feb-15,-,0,"Although long in the tooth by fast-changing design standards across the field of electronic devices, the Nexus 7 (2013 or FHD or ii version) is a real gem. The Google-ASUS partnership means that updates to the operating system are available soon after they are released. When received, the tablet is likely to be running some version of Android 4, but can easily be updated in steps right to Android 5 which is a more sophisticated and secure operating system than the earlier ones. I highly recommend going to Settings and System Update at the earliest and getting Lollipop (Android 5) even if you have to go through incremental updates before you get it. It is worth it for the security and peace of mind that results. As others have commented, the speed of operation and high quality of the color screen as well as the easy-to-hold 7"" format make this a device that feels just as contemporary, this-minute, and up-to-date and any tablet currently on the market that runs on Android. An Ultra Slim case like the one by FYY is a great addition to the tablet--svelte but protective and allowing great access to all controls."
B00DVFLJKQ,5,41,"Pretty Good, -1 for Reboots, -1 for Speakers and GPS Problems",Phantom Flier,3,Yes,03-Jun-14,1,1,"I'd give this five stars if not for:

- Random Reboots: These happen 2 - 3 times a day, though some days go without them. I have not figured out a pattern. It can happen while in use or while just sitting there. This is a widely reported problem.
- Very quiet speakers: My phone has a tiny single speaker that I can crank up and clearly hear... while I take a SHOWER. The speakers on this unit appear to be well under 1/3 that strength, and I can't turn it up loud enough in many circumstances. Quite a shame on such an otherwise solid product.
- GPS problems: GPS just refuses to work much of the time. I've played all the games with GPS Status, resetting the internal state, downloading assistance data and so on and so on and so on. The GPS on this unit has never been reliable for me. I've read about hardware hacks but... seriously? I shouldn't have to even think of that. Big disappointment.

Maybe the current builds of these are fine. Mine isn't. I shouldn't even have to consider a replacement, these should not be problems... Otherwise, I love it."
B00DVFLJKQ,5,42,Good tablet - auto rotate problem from time to time.,Rod Kjerstad,4,Yes,09-Aug-14,1,0,"I'm very happy with the tablet for the intended purpose. I use to to read Kindle, listen to Audible and lots of podcasts among other things. The battery life is good, the size is perfect and it is light weight. I use many of Google products and it integrates really well with all those products especially with Google voice for messages.

I have two on going problems that I don't think are common for the Nexus 7. First the auto rotate feature from time to time will get stuck in the portrait mode. Usually turning it off and on (sometimes repeatedly) will unstick it. It seems to be a software rather than a hardware problem. But whatever it is annoying. It didn't start happening until it was about 6 months old. Mine is a year old now.

The second problem is occasionally the touch screen will get a little slow to respond. I find this problem to be minor and about the same as other devices I have such as my iPad and my phone. The touch screen problem takes care of it self after a few minutes but the auto rotate problem is more annoying.

I would still buy the Nexus 7 again. When you consider the features for the price I think it is a very good choice."
B00DVFLJKQ,5,43,I'm so happy with this I could just keep on going with ...,Murl Harmon,5,Yes,08-Aug-15,2,0,"OMG! This tablet replaced my old nexus that just decided not to run the new OS. This tablet is so clear, fast, and stable! MAN! I'm so happy with this I could just keep on going with the accolades but, let me say this, get the 32 gig unit. You will not be unhappy with this tablet! Great value with superior performance! These may sound like boastful terms but after having an Acer (motherboard issues) Samsung (battery issues) 1st gen Nexus 7 16gig(OS issues) I'm just sold! (and just a side note, I reinstalled an older version of google OS on the Nexus 7 1st gen tablet and it works fine. Not very fast but it still works.)"
B00DVFLJKQ,5,44,"Hype is nice, but Performance is what counts",ANZicCO,3,Yes,19-Dec-13,-,0,"I have been hearing so many good things about this tablet, and android KitKat, that I finally purchased one.
The resolution of the screen is beautiful, snapdragon processor is snappy,and Kit Kat brings some nice albeit minor changes to android.
That's where my love affair with Nexus 7 ends. Two major issues plagued the 32GB version of the tablet:
First the keyboard and multi-touch have a problem. When using the built in Google virtual keyboard, most of the time I would get the wrong character or additional characters from what I typed. This was most problematic when trying to log in to a site with my password as I kept getting an error that my account and password did not match.. That's because the keyboard was adding additional letters to the ones I typed. For example, instead of ""Password"" it would add characters or type wrong ones so I would get something like ""] PPasddewoerdd""
I also had issues with wifi connectivity for Internet based apps and streaming content where I would get an error message ""APP has stopped suddenly"" or I would just get thrown out of a video.
Another pet peeve of mine is the large bezel at the bottom of the screen which made a 7"" screen look smaller than tablets with more of an edge to edge design.
I have returned it and am sticking with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 8 inch, which has proven very reliable. The slim design and additional useable screen real estate of the Tab3 8.0 outshines the overall performance of the new Asus designed Nexus 7.
Maybe I got a defective one, but from some Web searches the problems seem somewhat widespread, and apparently Google is aware of the issues but have yet to issue an update to fix them. Disappointed that performance didn't measure up to all the accolades of the tech media who seem to be in love with Google and Apple and extra critical of perhaps the industry's most innovative performer, Samsung."
B00DVFLJKQ,5,45,good tab( i thought),Richie,2,Yes,05-May-14,2,0,"i love this tab. had issues with the touch screen before kitkat update but they have diminish since the update. i can't get it a 5 star rating because i still have touch screen issues at time where i have to power off the tab and restart. also it seems to take 4hr + to recharge the battery. but it love the tab

edit 2016/6/10 and 2018/01/14
i've been having issues with ghost inputs and general responsiveness of the touch screen(for a while now). it makes the tab difficult to operate. hence, due to frustration, i don't use it as often as i did before. i thought the tab would've been better. 2 star deducted. my nephew who i bought the later model for first complained about it with his. i thought it was just his model but it wasn't.
I AM SCARRED AND WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER NEXUS TAB AGAIN( I expected much better from what was to be more premium than low end)."
B00DVFLJKQ,5,46,A highly worthy tablet even with all new ones popping up weekly.,Ben,5,Yes,14-Jul-14,-,0,"I wanted a smaller tablet since I have the iPad Air and I had also switched from the Samsung Note 2 to the Sony Z1 Compact. I had been eyeing the Nexus 7 for a few months and finally decided to get it because it fills the gap for me. The benefits of a larger screen than my phone and the advantage of portability over the iPad Air for a day trip without my day pack with me.

Well, it meets all my needs, the screen resolution is great, music and sound from the speaker are wonderful for games and videos and Spotify (I own several portable Bluetooth speakers but for convenience I don't bother to carry them with me as the built-in speakers suffice). I read my ebooks, surf the web and reply my email with ease and comfort. I really can't find anything wrong with it, battery life also is pretty impressive. I read some complaints about the battery being insufficient for an average day's use but I think it was due to older versions of Android; with KitKat, I enjoy a full day's use and more.

Samsung launched their Tab S, a thing of beauty in terms of design and display. But I do not see a need to get that nor do I plan to. First of all, the price difference is too great and second of all, I've had bad experiences with Samsung with their bad support for their older models. I also much prefer the Nexus and Sony's UI because I find that Samsung tries too hard with too many extra steps required, just to do some simple tasks such as moving app shortcuts around the different home screen pages.

Would I recommend the Nexus 7 2013? A definite and resounding YES! Final answer!"
B00DVFLJKQ,5,47,Great! I would definitely recommend!,Blunt Truth,5,Yes,09-Nov-14,1,0,"I love the tablet. It's a great replacement to my previous iPad, and it also replaces my kindle touch (yay!).

The size of the device could not be any more perfect, and the viewing ratio leaves the iPad mini with much to be desired.

I'm not a fanboy because I refuse to use anything aside from Apple iPhones (although I'm hating them on their latest iOS now with all of these ridiculous bugs), but this is a major upgrade from an iPad in my opinion. So much so that my wife even got one. Pulling her iPad away & replacing it with anything is about like pulling teeth from a child.

The full HD is fantastic.
Rooted & XBMC runs so smoothly.
Voice recognition works great.

I would definitely recommend this to everyone! I bought it because it was cheap enough to use for hulu & netflix in bed. What I mean is that I use a Surface Pro 2 & dropping it would be a nightmare. For the price of a Nexus 7, I can deal with replacing it :)"
B00DVFLJKQ,5,48,Love it!,jymmiphreak,5,Yes,14-Mar-14,-,0,"I use mine every day and have no complaints! Sure, I have to touch the screen more than once somethimes for it to register my touch, but I touch pretty lightly most of those times, so I don't think that is a glitch with it, even if I've read tons of reviews of others having touch issues. I don't have enough of an issue to complain. My first android device with more than 8gb of drive space, awesome! I doubt I go back to less! 16gb is just enough, 32 lets me put any app I want on there with no issues of running out of space! AND I can put all kinds of files on it as well! It is definitely noticeably lighter than the 2012. I also have no issues with the slenderness of the screen. I use it to surf the web, facebook, read books and comics, and play games, and it never gives me any trouble! I have had about a dozen different android devices now, and this one is the fastest and easiest to use I have had. I prefer this android over the galaxy tab's version as well. Great buy!

Edit 8-20-15: Passed this on to my 8 tear old about 6 months ago and it is still going strong with lollipop! every once in a while, the touch stops responding completely and I have to hold the power swich a few seconds to get it to turn off, but when I turn it back on, it's as good as new. It has 4 profiles on it with a different email and password for each and only issue is space. Still love it!"
B00DVFLJKQ,5,49,WOW!!!,Ben Campbell,5,Yes,04-Apr-14,4,0,"Wow, wow and wow is all I can write about the Nexus 7-inch, 32 GB 92013). Well, that's not true. It's more than what I'd expected. The clarity of videos and movies are catalytic, instantaneous Wi-Fi connection, spontaneous uploading, even interfacing with my laptop is spectacular; exchanging videos and photos is deliriously simple. Best of all, the 7-inch design is so light to hold and carry around. Typing on the keyboard is outrageously easy, the backside camera and video is contagiously easy to shoot images and movies, and uploading to all media is a snap. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter...whatever, uploading is universally simple. I guess I purchased the best of the lot."
B00DVFLJKQ,5,50,great for the price!,T.333,5,Yes,02-Feb-14,-,0,"First off, just want to make it clear I am NOT a technically inclined person. That being said, I still did my homework before choosing a tablet. This one got pretty high ratings by a couple of the most common tech review websights out there. The main reasons I went with the Nexus 7 is first, I really wanted one of the smaller sized tablets for easy portability and even in its' case this fits the bill. Second, and most important, I like the android operating system better for the fact you aren't bound to buying books, movies, etc...on iTunes only. I considered the Kindle for its' price & features as well, but again, bound mostly to Amazon & more added content/advertisements then I wanted(sorry Amazon)...thirdly, the price was definitely right for all the features you get!! And lastly, I've been very pleased with the video/sound quality, & ease of use. It comes right out of the box ready to use, and even though I'm not a techie, I've been able to figure applications out easily through Google's help pages. The only small negative I would say, is that the charging cord is too short--say if you're using it while having it plugged in & you haveto because you didn't get it charged before you wanted to use it& your battery is low :) but that's very minor in the over all picture. For the price point & features, I've been very pleased with my Nexus 7!! I'd highly reccomend this tablet to those looking for one in this category/price point."
B00DVFLJKQ,6,51,Great tablet,MSPDX97214,5,Yes,18-Mar-14,-,0,"(Pro)
It is lighter than Amazon Kindle Fire HD
Very fast (good CPU, RAM and Android OS)
tons of apps. (highly customizable)
The battery life is very decent. (recharge it once a day)

(Con)
32gbs go very fast. And no external storage options! (I use Nexus Media Importer. But a SD card slot would have been nicer)
The power switch/volume control are not intuitive. (the Kindle has a better layout)
It is fairly slim. That's generally good. But the size of the screen gets limited while playing back clips. Kindle is better on this point

(Am I happy?)
Oh yes. it is worth the price. After buying Nexus 7, I use my laptop much less frequently. (Sometimes, I don't even turn it on) Also my smartphone has become really a phone. I use Nexus 7 more often than the laptop & the smartphone combined.

One major blemish is the lack of external storage options. if they want to beat Kindle, that's the answer right there.

Compared to Kindle (I have Kindle Fire HD 16gbs).... if you are a prime member, it is a tough call. The Kindle probably has a bit better hardware. And you could get a great selection of free contents (Sherlock, Dr. Who, Skyfall etc.etc.) for FREE. If you are not a member, i believe the Nexus would be a better choice. As a computer, it is much easier to use. (The Kindle is really an Amazon entertainment box in the shape of a tablet) I use both. For movies/TVs and light web activities, the Kindle. For others, the Nexus.

All in all, it is a great tablet."
B00DVFLJKQ,6,52,The best tablet in the android market!,Rudolph Glen,5,Yes,27-Nov-13,2,0,"This is the best tablet I've tried among many that claim to be better. Materials are sturdy and well made, it feels resistant but super lightweight and holding it as it is (without any cover) feels really natural, although the screen is really large and the sides to hold it are small, you don't feel tired to hold it so fast mainly because of the lightweight... the sound quality is really good but perhaps it is not that powerful so I would recommend buying some bluetooth external speakers to raise volume higher, nevertheless if you use built-in speakers to watch youtube videos and so forth it'll be good and also they put a really clear sound...

Concerning the software and OS experience I really feel this is the best you can get if you like android systems, this would be without exaggerating the best tablet to run android in the market, the whole experience is frustration free and so easy that you don't even notice it... so, if there were any product out there that can compete with the new apple ipads it is definitively the google nexus tablet, specs are really great and the quality of the whole product is outstanding.

I would totally recommend this tablet to any user who needs a tablet to browse the internet, check mail, watch videos (except flash videos), listen to music and play games to buy with confident the google nexus tablets, they're so great!"
B00DVFLJKQ,6,53,Breaks very quickly,Andrew H,1,Yes,10-Jun-14,3,1,"I bought this tablet February 28th and it worked really well for 2 months until about April 29th when it would no longer charge. Sent it in to the Asus repair center and after they had it a week they had to wait on a part to arrive to fix it. I talked to Asus Customer service after they had it two weeks and they said that they couldn't repair it so someone from the repair center would contact me to confirm I wanted to swap for a tablet that would work. A week after that I had not been contacted so I talked to customer service again and they went ahead and confirmed that I wanted a replacement tablet sent. I received the replacement tablet on May 28th and spent all day updating it and re downloading all the apps and then when I tried using the voice commands it turns out they had sent me a tablet with broken microphones . So they paid for me to send it in to them this time and it has now been sitting at their repair center since June 3 with no status update on their repair status tool, so I talked to cs again on June 9th and they had to get the fedex tracking number to even see that it had arrived at the repair center and the cs representative escalated it to a supervisor to find out what was going on and now I am on my 2nd day of waiting on the Supervisor to call me. I only had the tablet 2 months before it broke and it had now been in repair for a month. i highly recommend not buying this tablet. 6/17/14 I just received my second replacement tablet and the microphone is broke on it too. I also never heard from a supervisor like I was told I would. They then tried to get me to pay for the shipping to have them repair the broken tablet they sent me.But after I asked them about it they sent me a shipping label."
B00DVFLJKQ,6,54,Exactly as Described - Changed to Guess Not,No BS,2,Yes,06-Nov-13,-,0,"Original Review: This product works as described and I would have given it five stars except for that my first unit died before I had even used it for a whole month. Amazon replaced it without worry because it was within the thirty days and the new one has had none of the issues that the original unit did.

Updated Review: So the second unit I received was defective and I didn't figure that out until we went on a trip where we were planning on using the GPS on it. Well the GPS did not work without an internet connection so that failed miserably. Support had me reset the device and do a bunch of stuff that has nothing to do with defective hardware, after doing all that they had me send it in for RMA through ASUS support. Well that didnt fix it and they sent he tablet back loose in the shipping box.

I was directed to customer support when I contacted the RMA office and said the problem isnt fixed. After about an hour with support and many, ""I under stand how frustrating it is for your _______ not to be working."" A set line to say, GPS was inserted. The resolution is I must send it back to RMA and they will not send a replacement ahead. So I am sure that the unit will be returned to me defective again and the original purpose of the unit was for travel...yes it is very frustrating when your gps/research unit does not work as advertised when you are in an unknown area."
B00DVFLJKQ,6,55,I love this device,DC NY,5,Yes,26-Dec-14,-,0,"I love this device. It's convenient, the right size. No complaints.

HOWEVER - if and when you order this, avoid ordering it from Lava Deals For You. If you have any problems with the device, and you've been through all the troubleshooting from other experts, they will deny it's a problem with the unit, and ask you to repeat the troubleshooting. They might also claim that your internet connection must be weak, or that you're running too many apps. Even if you have an identical device, which runs identical apps and works fine, they will avoid having to look at the damned thing.

When you finally get the unit to them, they will send it back without really examining it. Most likely, they will just perform a reset, which you have already done, so that it works for a while. But you will still have the same damaged unit, as before, and it will eventually conk out again.

And if you're unlucky enough to order from this distributor, don't even bother suggesting a refund. They will simply ignore the request.

Good device, but purchase it from distributors whom you can trust."
B00DVFLJKQ,6,56,"It's fast, great size and terrific value for money",Milind Rao,5,Yes,22-Apr-14,1,0,"I had the original Nexus 7. After a while that slowed to a crawl. And I pretty much stopped using it. I bought the Nexus 10 and love it. Then Google released 4.3 with fstrim support and my old Nexus 7 was back to it's old speed. I didn't think I would buy the 2013 edition since the old one was working so well. But I had made one big mistake with the original Nexus and had got the 8GB model and kept bumping into the limit. So I sold it and bought the new one. And it's significantly faster than the old one. I personally don't like reading books on it. For that, I still prefer the e-ink Nook, but my wife likes the Nexus 7 for reading. The kids use it for homework and to play games. Mail and Flipboard are the two main apps I use. The only problem with my Nexuses (I have 2 Nexus 10s) is that sometimes it's tough finding a free one. They are certainly getting used a lot more than my iPad ever did. For the price (and direct upgrades from Google), it's tough to recommend any other 7"" Android tablet. I feel for the competition."
B00DVFLJKQ,6,57,"Love my NEXUS, great price for POWERFUL computer!",mom of two,5,Yes,26-Dec-13,-,0,"Pros:
Cost -- WAY cheaper than ipad.
Wonderful screen (size and resolution)
Pure Android

I love, love this tablet. I can actually do a lot of work on it, and i enjoy the swype typing feature (there's one built in or you can download an app from the Google Play store). Love the dictation feature. These are key features for a table because no one likes typing on a tablet-sized or smaller screen.

I use mine as a phone (when i'm in wifi range), thanks to my Ring Central account (I pay a monthly fee for this for several phone lines for my company but you can get a VOIP app for free at the Google Play store).
With several productivity apps, I can do almost anything on the tablet that i can do on my MacBook, except detailed editing of large spreadsheets.

Got one for myself, gave it to my daughter, got this 2013 version for myself and loved it so much that I also gave one to one of my workers, so when she's out and about, she can respond to more work queries (she works virtually on her own schedule pretty much), instead of saying - sorry, only have my phone.

Also great for:
reading Kindle books (thanks to Kindle app. I find the screen work fine for that, though I prefer the kindle screen for just reading )
alarms
etc."
B00DVFLJKQ,6,58,"Best 7"" on the market",J. S. Johnson,4,Yes,17-Oct-13,-,1,"This thing is amazing. I own a TF700T. A good tablet to be sure but it's at times too big and heavy for extended use. The Nexus 7 is the perfect size and fits in my hand comfortably. The size is the reason I bought this tablet. But it's not the reason I love it so much. The screen is brilliant and the speakers are amazing. Normally, with most mobile devices, I struggle to hear music or movies with the volume up all the way. With my phone or other tablet if I don't have an external speaker to pump sound through, it's not worth watching a movie. With the Nexus 7, I have to turn the volume down slightly. Oh joy! Rapture! A device with more than adequate sound! I've never experienced such a mobile device before!

Other than that, the device is beautiful and comfortable. Top notch!

But it's not all roses. There are a few things to nitpick. There's no micro HDMI port so even though the Nexus 7 is great to watch movies on if I'm not in front of TV, I'll still need my TF700T if I want to watch movies on a TV while on the road say at a hotel or at my parents house. Then there's the lack of microSD card support. There's not enough room on the device for all my music and because this is the wifi only version, I'm not always going to have access to my music on the cloud.

These minor drawbacks prevent me from giving it 5 stars...but I knew these things going into the purchase. Overall, a fantastic tablet that I'd recommend to anyway."
B00DVFLJKQ,6,59,First Tablet,S. Moss,4,Yes,04-Jan-14,-,0,"This is my first tablet and it was between the Nexus 7 and the new Kindle Fire HDX. I decided to go with the Nexus. I just got it yesterday and I am pretty happy with it so far. It has the Google Play store, which I am familiar with since I have an android phone and downloaded my favorite apps including some games.

A quick Google search and I figured out how to move my music from my laptop to the Nexus. It responds well and moves smoothly. The Sound is good, picture is very nice. I have a Netflix subscription and opened Netflix for a few minutes just to check it out. It comes with Youtube preloaded and I added FB. I downloaded and opened a PDF file with no problem.

I am still trying to figure out all the stuff I can do with the camera, which is front and rear facing. I was unable to watch anything on Hulu, since I do not have a Hulu Plus subscription. I am a Amazon Prime member, but Amazon gave me a message, that I cannot play movies on this device, which I think sucks, but I guess that was my trade off.

I have not downloaded any movies or books yet (still a paper book fan, but that might change).

Downside, I am locked into 32GB (that is why I did not buy the 16GB). Overall I am pretty happy with my decision."
B00DVFLJKQ,6,60,Have to learn more about it.,G. F. T.,4,Yes,23-Feb-14,3,0,"I have most Apple products and thought i would try an Android to see what they offer in their tablet. It has really surprised me so far as to how many similar programs on it as my iPad mini has. It does take a while to learn the fundamentals of operating it.
Some of the reviews have it not connecting to a network ,not a problem here. I had it up and running on my network in a matter of moments. My GPS works great at my location .
For the price and what Apps, speed,camera, I am very pleased so far. The only reason I went 4 on my rating is, will have to see how long the unit holds up over a period of time.
Like I said for the price It really is a fine unit so far. I am surprised at what Apps and programs this tablet has. A pleased customer so far."
B00DVFLJKQ,7,61,Whoa,Jmat,5,Yes,14-Jan-14,1,0,"This thing is so fast and I really love how easy it is to use. I had none of the out of the box problems. The most difficulty I had was probably applying the damn screen protector I bought to go with it but that's another story. I use this to primarily read books, emulate PSX and SNES, and just browse in when I don't want to lug out my laptop. If the memory is an issue, just buy a micro USB connector with a USB 2.0 on the other end, a flash reader, and microUSB of your choice (I went with a 64GB) to switch out files, games, music, movies, etc if you are a media user like myself. It comes compatible so you can just literally plug'n'play

I do suggest skipping the tiny keyboards you could potentially get with a tablet because personally my hands are clumsy and a bit large to use the thing. May be more useful for the more dextrous user. The test of time is all I really need to see on this because we all know that most handheld devices start slowing down and showing their age after about a year. Accidental damage plan options are also plentiful. I have 0 regrets purchasing this device :)"
B00DVFLJKQ,7,62,Very Nice Tablet,StlJim,5,Yes,27-Feb-16,1,0,"Very nice tablet, much improved over the first gen Nexus. The first gen Nexus was really getting sluggish with the later Android systems. I had lollipop on my first gen and it was very sluggish, I have marshmallow on this second gen tablet and it is still very fast. Unfortunately the case from the older one is not compatible with this one so I purchased a new case but that's a small thing. I like the Nexus because they support the newer Android versions. I don't know if the first gen will get marshmallow or not because it was having problems with lollipop but this second gen works fine with it."
B00DVFLJKQ,7,63,Very happy,JCS,4,Yes,15-Nov-15,-,0,"We have been very happy with the Nexus 7. We have 2. 1 for 1.5 years and another for < 1 year. Did tons of research and for the price, I felt this was still my best option for the kids. The Kindle was in the mix (great value) but the deal breaker is you don't get the google play store. You get updates quickly. Marshmallow came out and was almost immediately available for download. This isn't that important for the kids though.

Screen resolution and performance is great. So far, they have held up well to the kids.

Would really like if they:
- Added an SD card slot (yes, there is no more nexus 7 but the newer ones could add one).
- Allowed apps to be fully installed and operational from an SD card (this is more Android issue: I have a Samsung phone that does have an sd card)"
B00DVFLJKQ,7,64,Nexus 7 with HD screen (1920x1200) and great battery life.,William C. Agnor,5,Yes,10-Jul-14,-,0,"The unit exceeds my expectations and it has great battery life. The high resolution screen (1920x1200) really is great and has a very wide viewing angle. I can watch music videos for hours and the battery indicator barley moves.

The only short coming is the built in 32GB memory. My previous tablet had an SD card for the 32GB memory and you got to use the entire 32 GB memory for your personal use where as the built in 32GB memory allows the Nexus to use about 6GB of the 32 GB memory for system operation thus leaving you around 26 GB for personal use. Other wise it is a great tablet - Well worth the price.

When watching streaming video over WiFi the unit works well. When you try to watch streaming WiFi video and connect the audio to external speakers with blue tooth the Nexus cant't keep up and stops ever 15 or 20 seconds to re-buffer. I doesn't seem to be able to handle streaming WiFi video and blue tooth audio at the same time. If you connect the audio by cable every thing works fine. This is still a great tablet with all the other things it can do."

I have changed my review to 4/5 from 3/5 because I was able to resolve the netflix issue. A reinstall did not work, however if you force stop the app, clear all cache, uninstall and THEN reinstall Netflix app appears to be working properly now. I will keep this review updated in case it happens again.

I use this to browse netflix for things to stream to my TV. Netflix freezes every single time I try to launch it after I have already been watching something.

ie

I watch something on netflix and finish it. I go to my homescreen to check my email. I go back into netflix and try to watch something and it endless loading screens me. I literally have to restart this thing (WHICH THERE IS NO DAMN RESTART BUTTON, REALLY GUYS>>) and can go back into netflix to watch something after it reboots.

A year later, I decided it was time to try a tablet again. I wanted something that I could use while on a bus and reading news articles or email, plus playing some minor games. I wanted to stick with the Android ecosystem since I already own an Android phone, plus I don't particularly like Apple. The Nexus 7 called to me, as it was a high resolution Nexus device (no worries about bad OEM skins and the like), plus it was far cheaper than the Nexus 10.

SIZE:
The size is pretty much perfect for me. My pant pockets tend to be rather long, so my Nexus 7 actually fits in my pocket. Usually, I keep it in my jacket pocket instead and tether my cell phone in order to browse the Internet while taking the bus to work. I think of it as having a paperback book with me, only substantially more useful.

SCREEN:
Simply beautiful. High resolution

BATTERY LIFE:
With heavy use, I usually get about two days of battery life on it; with more typical-for-other-people use, it is more like a week to a week and a half.

PERFORMANCE/WIFI:
I have no complaints about the performance of my Nexus 7. In fact, my sole complaint is with the defect in the 5 GHz antenna on the device; it will randomly shut off after connecting to a 2.4 GHz network until you reboot the tablet. No game that I've run on it has slowed down and everything works smoothly.

I love my Nexus 7, and I don't think I'd be anywhere near as happy with another device."
B00DVFLJKQ,7,67,Best 7 inch Android tablet available and a massive upgrade over last year.,Pratik Holla,5,Yes,28-Nov-13,3,1,"This tablet is a massive improvement over last year's model. I bought last year's model and was HIGHLY disappointed with the lag I was getting after several months of usage. I knew the bottleneck was the 1gb ram and they were using a processor from 2011 in a 2012 tablet.

That problem has been fixed in this one. With 2gb of ram and a snapdragon s4 pro processor, this tablet flies. There is no noticeable slowdown. They have added a camera but its not all that great. The speakers have been updated, and although i wouldn't say the sound is ""surrounding"" me, it is much louder from last years model. Also, the screen was a major reason i upgraded and is definetly worth it for this steal of a price. Last year's model was a little washed out but the 2013 model is extremely bright and colors are accurate. Pixels can no longer be differentiated in this tablet and is a joy to read books and magazines on.

I am not going to compare this with the Ipad mini Retina hardware wise. Both tablets have great displays and the average consumer wont notice much difference. However, in terms of usability, the android TABLET app ecosystem has some ways to go. The Ipad has WAYYY more apps than what is currently available on android. However, if all you need is something to check email on, play a few games, watch hulu/netflix, read news..... most of the heavy big hitter apps are available. There is no need to plunk down 500 dollars for an ipad.

A few cons: The power buttons and the volume rocker are on the same side and a little flush. Sometimes I hit the power button when i just want to turn the volume up. Battery life is great but definitely not top notch. I get around 5 hours of ""screen on"" time."
B00DVFLJKQ,7,68,"Took three tries, but I finally got one that worked",JNX,5,Yes,29-Aug-13,1,0,"Bought the first from Amazon when it was released and had to return it do to a rapid-fire selection of keys on the on-screen keyboard, much like what others described on youtube. Called Google Nexus support and the rep told me the issue I was seeing was happening to others. Instructed to return it to Amazon.

Bought the second from Google Play store and that one had a volume rocker that was sticking in the down position. Called Google Nexus support again and the support rep told me they'd seen this a number of times too. Instructed to return it to Google.

Third and final one came from Google Play store. So far, this one remains with me and does not seem to have any issues other than spotty bluetooth audio, but that is probably software related.

Screen is vibrant and clear. HD movies on Netflix takes a minute or so to buffer and you'll notice the video pixelation clear right up. Using AirDroid, I can easily transfer files and movies to it without a wire.

Now the search for a decent case/cover for it."
B00DVFLJKQ,7,69,Very disappointed!,Gary,3,Yes,03-Jun-14,4,1,"After reading glowing reviews from numerous different sources, I decided to purchase the Nexus 7. I really wanted a little larger screen to go with my Nexus 10, but after reading the reviews I settled on the Nexus 7. I was extremely disappointed. The Nexus 7 has a beautiful screen, but the touchscreen was not at all responsive. I love to take photos with my tablet, but the camera on the Nexus is barely adequate. The 7 inch screen was just too small also. For a little more money I was able to buy a Samsung Galaxy Pro 8.4...the screen is better than the Nexus, the screen is larger and more responsive, and the 8MP camera takes beautiful photos! I couldn't be happier ."
B00DVFLJKQ,7,70,Loose / wobbly micro USB port!,Dr. Sean Henry,3,Yes,09-Nov-14,2,1,"I have had this item for 7 months now and like it in general, but it has become increasingly difficult to charge or connect to my computer due to an increasingly loose USB port, making it hard for USB cables (and I've tried several) to keep a firm connection. since they wobble around in the socket. I have discovered through online discussion forums that this is a chronic problem with the Nexus 7 (2013) .

I have now had to invest in a wireless charger in order to keep the product operating. If you buy the Nexus 7 (2013), my advice is to connect the USB cable very carefully and don't operate or move the Nexus around while it's plugged in."
B00DVFLJKQ,8,71,Totally Love it,Ale Hernandez,5,Yes,03-Feb-14,-,0,"This was a great buy, Is the right size for me, can be very light and mobile, As I got the 32Gb version has more than enough room, I even have a whole load of music in it and I had a mount for my car.

Is very fast so is great for games, A real good help so I don't have to have a lots of apps in my phone because many apps I rather run it in a larger display.

Got OTA Kitkat 4.2.2 right after I turn it on, and I got it unlock and rooted very fast and easy,

The Ok Google function (SIRI for android almost) is very cool and usefull, I guess Android will have a very good Siri like voice assistant in the near future.

Battery life is good and if you manage it using tasker or Juice Defender will be even better.

The only problem I got now is that can't connect to my Linksys Smart router on the N 5ghz band (only on the 2.4Ghz), As I don't have any other 5Ghz wireless device to test I don't know if is a router problem, N7 problem or Kitkat problem so I cant tell ergo I dont say is a product problem for sure.

More than happy with it,"
B00DVFLJKQ,8,72,I'm sure all of the internal computer/electronics magic is impressive,Joshua Bradley,4,Yes,09-Jan-14,1,0,"While the actual electronic parts of the Nexus 7 impress, I'm disappointed by some of the more tangible features:

1. My biggest gripe is with the sound/power keys. They practically lay on top of each other. This makes adjusting the volume a task that you must focus on - with a clumbsy or absent minded finger, you're more likely to shut the screen off than turn the volume up.

2. The camera is always under my thumb when I pick it up. I'm not sure how. But, somehow, the placement of the camera makes it a prime target to be fingerprinted as I lift the tablet from the table.

3. The speakers are unimpressive. I hate that the Nexus 7 must be paired with a Bluetooth speaker in order to be heard while in the shower. That said, the Bluetooth pairing is painless.

Otherwise, fantastic machine. The resolution is amazing, and the Android ecosystem is awesome."
B00DVFLJKQ,8,73,Àlmost Perfect,WN808,5,Yes,13-Mar-14,-,0,"I have now owned two of these second generation units. My first one expericed the GPS glitch (patch fixed) and eventually suffered a cracked screen...which was rather strange as I had not dropped the unit or handled it roughly. But it worked so well that I missed it and didn't want to go back to the original Nexus7 that I still had.

This second unit was shipped promptly and identical to the first with the exception that the USB charging cable was considerably shorter for some reason. I have experienced no problems on this second unit, even before updating the unit.

If you own the original Nexus 7 and like the form factor consider making the upgrade as there is a considerable performance gap and the screen is leap years ahead in resolution and brightness.

Consider getting the Moko Google New Nexus 7 FHD 2nd Gen Case. It fits great and protects it for a great price.

And Google...Nexus 8...bigger isn't always better. I can actually fit this into my pants pocket(well not my jeans). I can't do that with an iPad Mini."
B00DVFLJKQ,8,74,Best option in a small tablet,Dog Friendly,5,Yes,11-Jun-14,-,0,"I'm not sure that a tablet is one of those products that anyone actually needs. It does fill a gap between a smartphone and a laptop. I have had zero issues with this since I purchased it. The lack of an option to add an SD card hasn't been a problem since I normally don't store that much on the tablet. I got it mostly to read digital magazines and do some light web browsing away from the computer. There's where I see a problem with a 7"" tablet. I don't find it all that useful for either without a lot of zooming. It may be my older eyes. I had a 10"" tablet that died and that wasn't comfortable to hold for extended periods of time. I'm waiting to see what Google brings out to replace the Nexus 10. There are rumors that it might be an 8.9"". That might be the sweet spot in terms of size. I'm just not sure that I use a tablet enough to justify the expense of another one when this one works fine for almost everything else."
B00DVFLJKQ,8,75,"Nexus devices are good products, but not from this seller =(",STEVEOM82,1,Yes,19-Oct-15,-,1,"an update on a previous review...

I purchased this device in June of this year. It came with a developers OS on it instead of the retail version. Contact sellers, they wouldn't help. Had to fix it myself after hours of pouring through Youtube to figure out how to flash the retail OS. Now, 4 months later, the gyroscopes aren't working and the touchscreen is...moody. This is a great product, but the stuff this business is selling is not very good in my experience.

The business contacted me after my first review to ask if I would remove my review for a $50 refund. Im glad I didn't take it because now that the sensors and touchscreen aren't working properly, I will only update/remove my review if they replace it fully with one that works as it was designed to when shipped directly from Google. What a waste of almost $200!"
B00DVFLJKQ,8,76,Heads above the previous edition,M. Tabor,5,Yes,22-Jan-14,-,0,"Great Brightness, Stronger Wifi/GPS and excellent battery life are just some of its high points. At least twice as fast as my previous N7 in raw power and the 2 GB of ram makes it a dream to work with. New internal storage provider has does wonders for file transfers and program load times to boot. Games run very smooth and day to day activities perform without stutter or pause. The screen some how seems ""softer"" in use and does not show smudges as much as my previous unit. Has enough internal storage capacity that at 1/2 full i still have plenty of room to do about 2 hrs of video recording for my sons events and have room left over and my videos are very good quality. Camera is adequate for day to day usage in daylight but suffers indoors in only artificial light. Using 3rd party camera apps has helped with that some. Over all i love this device and believe it should give me a long over all service life.

Buy a good case and a Squaretrade Drop and spill and you will have no regrets!"
B00DVFLJKQ,8,77,Good quality tablet,Nancy Black,5,Yes,17-Apr-14,2,0,"We bought the Nexus 7 tablet because we want something smaller than a laptop to take on trips. We started by identifying our primary uses: e-mail, surfing the web, reading e-books, checking finances, reading docs and spreadsheets. Our investigation showed that the Nexus 7 (32 gb) met those needs at a reasonable cost. The only downside is that the Nexus does not have a slot for a micro-SD card.

We have not had the Nexus for very long. It has worked well. So far, lack of a micro-SD card has not been a problem. One caution -- the Nexus will use a significant amount of internet and wi-fi bandwidth. If you have a somewhat slow connection, as we do, you may notice a slowdown on your computers and other internet-connected devices."
B00DVFLJKQ,8,78,Great little road warrior,Z. Mullan,5,Yes,10-Jun-14,-,0,"I got the Nexus 7 primarily for it's portability. It also has a flawless screen, 1200x1824 320 Dpi.

It's small enough to fit in a small bag or the pocket on my cargo shorts. Its great for playing movies or handling other types of media. I've watched several movies with it on airplanes. The on board speakers are good enough to serve as a radio or MP3 player even without headphones.
The 1.5 Ghz, quad core CPU, and 2 GB of RAM make it power through web pages and social media apps.
The Wifi is solid and is able to pull in signals that my phone cannot.

The weakest link is likely the camera(s). No flash, and lower resolution than the one on my phone. But who is really taking pictures with a tablet? The other minor gripe is that it only has 32GB of storage, and no way to expand it. My Mp3 player has more storage than that. But I have yet to run into that wall.

Overall I like this unit a lot and I have no regrets with buying it."
B00DVFLJKQ,8,79,Works Great,JakeDog,5,Yes,13-Apr-19,1,0,"I have had and used this Tablet since 2013 and it still works as good as the day I got it.

That being said there are no Firmware Updates.

Has lasted 6 years+ with no issues and the battery is still in great shape"
B00DVFLJKQ,8,80,Asus is selling old stock...for top dollar.,musicmonster,2,Yes,21-Jul-15,9,0,"old stock..manufacture date 8/2013 purchase date 1/2015....
that 20 months of sitting fully discharged in a hot warehouse apparently isn't enough reason to discount it and we are supposed to eat the loss in battery life huh?
update...battery life definitely is dropping in less than 6 months, not surprised, ASUS didn't care and claims that the battery is not covered. support is effectively non existent.. picked up a 16gb version and it has a production date of 3/2015!!! .the nexus 7 still fits in our life and heres hoping a newer production with presumably newer battery stock will last longer..
Check the production date of the device before you unbox it...if its not within this year SEND IT BACK...do not bother with ASUS they will try to assure you that it is new and covered by warranty...this is BS..go through amazon, get a fresh tablet and ignore the shifty manufacturer's promises..."
B00DVFLJKQ,9,81,Everything I could want,Lucas,5,Yes,15-Nov-15,-,0,"Awesome device and really cheap. This thing is pure android, and for those that don't know that means that it is without all the extra little crap that you usually get on phones and tablets when you buy them through your wireless company. This is almost 3 years old, and I've had it for about a year as well. It still is fast and responsive. I've been nothing but impressed with this little thing.

Ok so you know the device is good, but what about the seller, after all these are refurbished right? Well I can only say one negative thing about the whole experience. The charging cable/adapter that they send with the device is super cheap and flimsy and will most likely eventually break. Other than that I had absolutely no problems. The device came with protective clear plastic on it and showed almost no signs of wear. No scratches on screen or camera. You could hardly tell this thing wasn't brand new. The battery is also spectacular. I'm not sure if when they refurbished this device they put a new battery in or now. But the battery seems to last quite a while.

All in all this is an excellent product sold by a reputable retailer."
B00DVFLJKQ,9,82,BEWARE OF LOLLIPOP UPDATE!,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,27-Apr-15,6,1,"Tablet was working great until a few days ago. After it loaded the latest Lollipop update, it is now stuck on displaying Google on the screen and won't go any further. A google search will show several people having same/similar issue. I STRONGLY suggest not loading any OS updates until the issue is resolved."
B00DVFLJKQ,9,83,Great little tablet,J. Carruthers,5,Yes,16-May-14,-,0,"I got this device for use at home when my iPad 2 started showing its age. I was weighing this against a refurbished original iPad Mini and decided mostly based on cost and the fact that I really wanted a retina display! It's been an excellent tablet. The display really is beautiful and it's noticeably faster than my iPad 2. I also really like the form factor; it's very comfortable to hold onto for gaming or reading. The display also contributes to a great reading experience. The battery life was better than I expected - I knew it wouldn't last as long as an iPad but I can get through a few evenings' use without a charge.

A few drawbacks to keep in mind:
The Android market doesn't have nearly the selection of tablet apps that iOS does - the disparity for tablet apps is much greater than for phone apps. Also the device does become noticeably warm if you spend some time watching videos or playing an intensive game."
B00DVFLJKQ,9,84,"Ordered Black, received White tablet",Guy Scharf,4,Yes,16-Sep-17,1,0,"Ordered tablet from ""best seller 23"". Tablet was shown as black on the order but received white tablet; original Google label on box said it was white too. Manufacture date shown as 11-2013, so this is old stock and battery was totally flat on arrival (which is not surprising). After charging, tablet works fine and updated without problems to Android 6.0.1. (This is my second Nexus 7; my wife wanted one too.)"
B00DVFLJKQ,9,85,Love it,Karen Cole,5,Yes,06-Feb-14,-,0,"After reading so many reviews and agonizing over which tablet to buy I am so happy with my decision. I realize that it is important to identify what features are most useful to you when deciding. I definitely wanted a smaller, more portable tablet that I could just throw into my bag. I also wanted an android platform and the fact that this one gets updated with the latest version was a top factor. I Love how it syncs with my PC and Android phone. I am not much for specs as they don't measure my personal satisfaction with things like screen satisfaction or speed. All I can say is that the screen clarity and color (are those even specs?) are great. Camera is great although I would not consider it my choice of device for digital pictures. I leave that to my Canon Digital camera which is great or my smart phone Samsung Galazy S4mini when on the go. I don't play games so no opinion on that. Great for watching movies/videos. One downside-does not support Amazon Prime movies (I wonder if this is intentional as the Fire is a worthy competitor). I got the 32G although I don't think I will ever come close to capacity. I have cloud storage so it really isn't a factor to me anyway. If you are an apple enthusiast..then go for it since you won't be happy unless you have that logo. Everyone else will not be disappointed with this if like me you have identified your needs."
B00DVFLJKQ,9,86,A Great Family Tablet,Woman42381,5,Yes,02-Mar-14,1,0,"I'm very happy with this tablet! Had considered a Kindle Fire, but this has all the same good features, and none of the bad. All at $200 less!

It is super fast, awesome display, and pretty easy to use. Its a bit of an adjustment if you're used to iOS, but very user-friendly.

The rear camera was a requirement for me, and the one on the Nexus 7 is just great. Comes with some basic photo editing software which is easy to use and makes for lovely pictures. You can also set multiple user accounts on the tablet, just like on a PC. So I can choose what apps my kids will have access to and what permissions they will have within the apps.

The speakers are pretty good, especially for a tablet. They ate louder and clearer than I expected. The screen is excellently clear and great for movies and games.

Overall, I'm very happy with this tablet and would not hesitate to recommend it to others."
B00DVFLJKQ,9,87,My favorite tablet,D3N1Z3Nx,5,Yes,07-Apr-15,1,0,"This was the best tablet purchase I've made aside from my iPad with cell service. That thing is still in a league of its own. But this is entirely usable and charges in about 3 hours total which makes it awesome enough that I bought one after they were discontinued for a slight premium, still worth it. The quick charge and super long battery life put this in a different game altogether. This is likely to remain my favorite tablet for some time. I suspect the iPad mini would win me over but for the lack of any color options to the themes..... That is literally the only reason I quit iPad, but it's a big one, no customization at all."
B00DVFLJKQ,9,88,Its not the best in every category but it ranks nicely high on ...,Margaret H,5,Yes,06-Apr-15,1,0,"This unit was selected after numerous hours of research reading reviews and comments of all the tablets of this size on the market. Its not the best in every category but it ranks nicely high on the lists and the price made it a top choice. I have been very, very pleased with the hardware but sadly disappointed with google bloatware that can not be uninstalled. The constant advertisements that cannot be blocked are very frustrating. Honestly, I probably will root unit and install android cyanogen operating system instead for independence from anyone's ecosystem like apple or google forces on you. The question is: will this review pass the censors?"
B00DVFLJKQ,9,89,Disappointed at the moment,emzbiz,1,Yes,30-Nov-14,4,1,"I had the old Nexus 7, which finally died. Ordered the new 32gb , received it yesterday. Set it up and am seeing mediaserver use 70%+ of my battery and unit not even lasting a few hours. It synced up with all my old info and only thing I downloaded was candy Crush. Never had this happen with the old one. Have been searching for solutions and it appears to be a problem. Don't know if I must do a restore or what. Seems crazy as this is brand new. Disappointed at the moment."
B00DVFLJKQ,9,90,Really good.,V,5,Yes,23-May-14,1,0,"Pros: I have this thing hooked into everywhere. LAN into my local network, FTP to my seedbox, streaming true 720p & 1080p video files which are 6-8GB each with ease. It even has the power to skip forward on the stream with only a 1 second buffer. That's a lot to ask for even my Intel i3 media center tower. I've had this for over a month and probably charge it once a week. It uses almost no battery. I played music via bluetooth for 2 days straight camping and it only got down to 65%. The bluetooth antenna also has an impressive range. Combined with my Blockrocker, I was able to walk 60 ft away without skipping a beat. The shell is solid with no flexing or sounds when I handle it, even roughly. I don't use a case with it. I'm fairly certain it is indestructible, but I don't have kids yet ;-). Asus is a good ""go to"" brand for quality products. If I you don't build your own computers, I'd suggest checking out their PC's next time you are in the market.

Cons: No SD card slot. I love having a 32gb sd card in my phone for music. This now isn't really a problem since I'm using Spotify and no longer pirating music (mostly). The only other things I could complain about are little nit picky things about Android, which is only quasi-relevant to this review, like a Dell owner complaining about the windows start menu.

Other thoughts: Google is now my preferred source for tablets. The purity of the Android on this device is unmatched. I don't like manufacture's manipulation of operating systems. Buying a Google device means when Android gets updated, you get the update first."
B00DVFLJKQ,10,91,"Fast and Speedy.. Hardware buttons, meh.",Joseph Palmer,4,Yes,18-Dec-13,1,0,"Overall the Nexus 7 (2013 edition) WIFI ONLY is an awesome value. It packs a power punch in the CPU/GPU department. What I dislike about it are the hardware power and volume buttons I feel like if I press them too much they'll get stuck, plus they are a bit awkward to find if you're grasping for it in low light situations. Also, about 25% of the time using the tablet with your fingers it won't register some touch presses. I recently picked up a Truglide stylus and that seems to mitigate those issues completely. Also, the camera is pretty basic I wouldn't buy this tablet for the camera capability. On a really good note, battery life, even after full use during the day is OUTSTANDING. I use the tablet to stream spotify or pandora on a daily basis and when I'm using it as a display screen for photography at full brightness battery performance does not dissappoint. Screen resolution is phenomenal!! I use eyefi and dropbox for some photography work and for some hobby shooting, so yes using the Nexus 7 as a second display is perfect."
B00DVFLJKQ,10,92,"Good, Solid, Tablet",WC,5,Yes,10-Nov-15,-,0,"I'm pleased with this tablet. Never owned a tablet before because I use my smartphone a lot but I thought I'd get one and I don't care that this is the 2013 model. It has everything I need, its fast, responsive, and 32 GB is enough memory for me. I can't see how you could go wrong with this tablet especially considering the price. It seems to be well made and it's a lot less that the apple products and others that cost an arm and a leg and have proprietary software. I wanted all my software to work together without problems so this tablet is perfect for me. I would highly recommend this product especially after reviewing very technical reviews from very savvy reviewers."
B00DVFLJKQ,10,93,LOVE this tablet!,Kavet83,5,Yes,20-Aug-15,-,0,"I really love my Nexus! My husband surprised me for my birthday a year ago with this. I'd only used an iPhone before so I wasn't sure about getting used to an android operating system but now I prefer it. I love having a back button! I love being able to move the cursor where I want it. I like the size of this, not too big or small. I read a lot of ebooks and its weight is good. I immediately put a tech armor screen protector and devicewear case on it to protect it. Sometimes my camera won't work but if I restart the device than it works again fine. I have an iPhone and iPod touch but I much prefer this to an iPad. The price was great for all the storage and a tablet that is fast and works well."
B00DVFLJKQ,10,94,First tablet and I love it!,Amazon Customer,4,Yes,16-Jun-14,-,1,"I have never thought I'd want or need a tablet. I figured that my phone would be all that I need but after my laptop crapped out I decided to take the plunge. I asked many of my friends who are tablet owners their thoughts between the iPad, Kindle or Google tablet and the vast majority of them suggested the google tablet. The price is WAY less than the IPad and only a little more than the Kindle and has much more space. It was really easy to set up and figure out how to use. The biggest issue I have is Amazons stuck up elitist attitude with regard to it working with Amazon instant video or music. If you are a very frequent Amazon prime user, you will be extremely disappointed with their integration (or lack thereof) with this tablet. You can't play any of your music or movies that are on your Amazon drives. You can't even download them to your computer and then put them on your tablet. Amazon- seriously. Get over your s*** already. You're a giant company, I am pretty sure you're big enough that you can share your features with other products that aren't just Amazon."
B00DVFLJKQ,10,95,"Great tablet, but the USB charging cable almost caught fire!",LeapFrog,4,Yes,27-Feb-14,1,0,"The new Nexus 7 tablet offers the best of Android without all the bloatware that you get from most tablet makers. The display is stunning - as good as an iPad mini. The user interface is responsive but scrolling is perhaps not quite as smooth as the iPad. I was a bit disappointed by the battery life, which isn't the greatest - six hours on a charge is about all you can expect with GPS and WiFI enabled, checking email and watching videos. All in all this is the best bang for your buck in a 7 inch tablet, at least as of this writing.

Here's a warning - I left the supplied ASUS charger and micro-USB cable plugged in overnight (but fortunately the cable was not connected to the Nexus.) When I woke up the next morning the micro-USB plug had literally melted, with plastic oozing out of the plug housing and through the plug itself. Had the cable been plugged in it would have destroyed the Nexus USB connector. I've seen several reports on the web of this scenario. Until ASUS / Google does a recall or starts shipping a better cable my recommendation would be to avoid using the supplied cable for charging; either buy a good grade replacement cable or - even better - use a wireless charger."
B00DVFLJKQ,10,96,Not my idea of a great company because there are no choices for the consumer,Joe535,1,Yes,13-Jul-14,3,1,"Purchase Nexus 7 2013 two months ago. Rear camera never worked and front camera works occasionally. Read comments on google search for problems with camera and there are a ton. Besides the camera a major drawback seems to be that you need to have a google account-email to tie into apps such as you tube. There are work arounds, but for the non-techie it is time consuming or frustrating. I would be reluctant to deal with their products again, for the anonymity is gone and to fully utilize their ""system"" you need to be linked directly and forever into it. Not my idea of a great company because there are no choices for the consumer, unless I ignore, but try to ignore log in for g-mail by cancel and they keep coming back and the device becomes useless or cumbersome unless you sign in. There ought to be a non-sign in option to use their services."

Very good tablet, ultrafast, with a few annoyances.
Even though specs wise, its unbeatable for the price, it seems like this tablet was glued.
When using protector case, you can see the borders cracking open when you remove it from the protector. Im only concerned about the durability due to this fact.
Also, bought an MHL adapter, and either the tablet have issues with audio or the adapter was defective. Only video will play in TV.
I really wish these tablet had a microsd slot. It would be the best in the market with it."

She loves it, even though she thought she'd never have a reason to own a tablet. Recently, our dog ran through the house and got snagged on the charger it was plugged in to. The screen happened to land first, and shattered, which was very upsetting (it was a fluke, it was its case, just landed the wrong way). Within a day, I had ordered her a new one because she loved it so much and was incredibly upset that it had been broken. Needless to say, we're a bit more careful with it now.

My only issue with the tablet at all is its fairly weak battery life. Don't expect to get more than about 5-7 hours of standard use out of it; we have to charge it every night, and under heavy use, it doesn't make it through the day all the time.

Aside from the minor battery issue, this tablet is 100% top notch.

B00DVFLJKQ,10,99,Best tablet I've ever used.,David R. Chase,5,Yes,24-Nov-13,-,0,"Had some hands-on time with this after having an iPad Mini for a little over a year. The OS feels more solid to me than iOS (this is personal preference). The overall feel of the tablet is better to me, with a nicer screen, more responsive input, and a nice rubberized back which makes it feel better in my large hands. It feels just as fast as the iPad to me. The battery life leaves a little to be desired especially in standby mode but I found that Google Play Services is eating up battery for unknown reasons (just uncovered a few days ago), so hopefully a fix is coming for that shortly.

Otherwise, overall this has been my absolute favorite tablet experience. I did like the iPad Mini but it felt restrictive for the price, and the Android-based Nexus 7 seems to allow me to do more. Swype is also nice to have, as I've been using it on my Android phones for a while now, and it's hard to go to a tap-input style keyboard. :)"
B00DVFLJKQ,10,100,Auto rotation issues and screen dead spots,A. Walcott,2,Yes,09-Nov-18,-,0,"I’ve had this device for about 3 years it was working great and working as it was supposed to. In the last year it auto rotates sporadically, started putting in ghost letters, then parts of the screen stopped responding. As a result I can’t type certain things in the search. I tried to restore from factory settings to try to fix it, but now I can’t enter my google password cause part of the screen is dead n it won’t auto rotate."
B00DVFLJKQ,11,101,ASUS does it again!,jms,5,Yes,27-Jan-15,1,0,"I ordered this as an upgrade from my older Nexus 7. This tablet has managed to take a great product and make it even better. Who would have thought that possible. I was on the fence as to wait for the 2014 version or go with the 2013. As it turns out, there is not going to be a 2014 or 2015 (that I can find) version of the 7. Google, partnering with HTC, released a 9' version. But frankly it is too big for carrying around. I use mine extensively on public transportation and the 7' is perfect for me.

With all that said, it is a great tablet! Long battery life. Fast performance. Would buy another in a heartbeat."
B00DVFLJKQ,11,102,Five Stars,mbean,5,Yes,11-Aug-14,1,0,"Perfect travel companion!

I'm updating my review. I have had this tablet for a year now. I use it mostly for travel - I don't have to lug around a laptop any more! It connects easily to wifi wherever wifi is available. When there is no wi-fi, there is plenty of storage (I got the 32 GB) for books and music. Even though the model I bought doesn't have 3G/4G, it is easy to save maps in Google Maps and then use it to navigate even when you no longer have a wifi connection. Battery life is good. I have not had any problems with crashes or other issues. The screen is beautiful and reading is easy. (I can't report about video playback - I usually use it to read and listen to music.) The size is perfect - like a paperback novel. It fits in most of my jacket pockets and even in the back pocket of my jeans! After a year, I am really glad I bought this. Definitely a 5 star product."
B00DVFLJKQ,11,103,I love this tablet,S.L.S.,5,Yes,13-Jan-15,-,0,"We own two of these and bought a third for a gift. I love this tablet. It is vastly improved over the old design (which we also own). It's lightweight and powerful. Picture quality is great for watching video, it's easy to read on (which I didn't expect to like, but it's growing on me), and it's so convenient!

I like the versatility of the Android app store, and you can also install the Amazon app store and use apps from there as well. We have one configured for toddler use with an Android child lock app and another for my personal use. The flexibility is GREAT.

We purchased an external keyboard for our gift recipient as well, and she is able to use it while traveling in replacement of a laptop."
B00DVFLJKQ,11,104,Glass breaks easily,Michael Crick,2,Yes,30-Oct-14,2,1,"The tablet was ok but the glass is fragile. I bought a metal case for it and took it to CA in my inside jacket pocket. When I came back from breakfast at my hotel I found the glass was cracked and the unit was useless. It was on the table so I suppose the lady making my bed could have dropped it but unlikely. Otherwise it's a mystery. ASUS wants to charge me $200 to fix it!

I had trouble with ASUS before. I had a notebook with a defective USB port. I sent it back and they ""fixed"" it for free this time. Only problem -- the USB port still didn't work!"
B00DVFLJKQ,11,105,It's all in the screen,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,07-Feb-14,-,0,"I have been using hand held computers for a long time. If there is one lesson I have learned it is that the better the screen the better the experience. The screen on the new Nexus 7 is truly amazing. Resolution, contrast, saturation and responsiveness are all excellent. Add a fast processor, a full set of features and an ever improving operating system and interface and you have a product that is hard to beat at a great price.
Installing the Dolphin browser with jetpack and Java and I am able to take full advantage of my prime membership without being locked into a Kindle Fire tablet with outdated Android versions. (I own the original Fire and like it but am fed up with not having the latest Android version.)
I just wish Chromecast had more apps or that the Nexus built in support for streaming all screen content."
B00DVFLJKQ,11,106,Nexus7 Tablets Have A Touch Screen Defect,Charles L. Lake,2,Yes,24-Oct-14,-,0,"I have ordered a couple of these and they are fine tablets, but there is a flaw that I have advised Amazon about. I have returned three I think, and they have a touch screen problem. After a couple or three months the screen stops responding at times, and makes different characters. This one started in Feb. It works fine for a couple of months, then starts to not respond. I advised Asus and was advised to do a settings change of some sort...but it didn't solve the problem. The 2013 model is worst, but the 2012 model does it,but not as bad. There should be a record of my contacting a cust service person concerning this. I tried a screen test app, looking for dead pixels, etc, but did not solve the problem. I need to return . I need to talk to a Cust service Rep"
B00DVFLJKQ,11,107,"This is worth buying or at least, taking a good look at!",Dallas,5,Yes,20-Nov-13,-,0,"My eight-year-old daughter loves this. I like it as well and think it has a better picture than my iPad mini. My only negative is that it is kind of hard to turn on and off and it is fairly small. I think if you have smaller hands and are a child, this is a good deal. I prefer the size of my iPad mini, but the Nexus has a lot better picture and seems a bit faster.
It is very lightweight and I bought a case for it and it does seem to make it a bit safer. It is quite a bit cheaper than the iPad mini and definitely worth the money if cost is a factor for you. If the Nexus was the same size as an iPad mini, I definitely would suggest buying it without a doubt. I would recommend that you physically use one before buying it. Check it out at some store it possible and get a feel for it before you plop down all the money. The size of it may be a factor for you."
B00DVFLJKQ,11,108,Very happy with this purchase,OCpaul,5,Yes,03-Oct-14,1,0,"I have been most pleased with the Nexus 7. I find the size to be perfect for my use...big enough to be able to read most things without zooming and small enough to allow use for long periods without tiring. I now find I need to use my 12"" portable very infrequently and that means I can lighten my load when traveling.

The screen is extremely clear, apps load quickly and the keyboards are just large enough to allow fairly fast text input with few mistakes.

Buying a factory refurbished unit with a solid guarantee from the vendor for 30 days and a 1 year warranty from Asus has proved to be a good, money saving choice."
B00DVFLJKQ,11,109,I love the Nexus 7,pugmom,5,Yes,10-Apr-15,-,0,"These are the best tablets on the market! I own 5 of them 2 of the 2012's and 2 2013 32 GB and 1 16 GB 2013. These 2 I bought refurbished and they have worked like my others. I bought the 2013 models to upgrade to having both a front and rear facing camera for my granddaughters. You also have the capability of creating restricted profiles so your children do not have access to anything you do not want them to have without you there to sign into your google account. My granddaughters 8&9 do not have access to youtube, play store or internet service without having someone sign in to a google account. I also bought them because google is no longer making them you will not find a better tablet at this price."
B00DVFLJKQ,11,110,"Gorgeous, Fast, Tablet to Measure All Others By",Duncan M.,5,Yes,09-Jan-14,-,0,"The 2012 Nexus left a sour taste in a lot of people's mouths with its underwhelming performance and lackluster display, but don't let this misstep keep you from checking out this bad boy.

Display: The 2013 Nexus 7's display is gorgeous. 1080p on a 7"" screen is so crisp and beautiful. Images pop like you wouldn't believe and text is sharp and so much more readable than a 720p display.

Performance: Spectacular. With so much RAM and a Quad Core processsor, applications run smoothly and I haven't noticed any lag when multitasking.

Battery: I am amazed and I can generally use this for a full day when playing games or listening to music. It's really great.

With hotfixes for android rolling out occasionally, and the features that are already included with this tablet, you really cannot go wrong. 5/5"
B00DVFLJKQ,12,111,Right Out of Science Fiction,David,5,Yes,06-Jul-14,-,0,"The most satisfying of the six pads I own and is the only one to do everything I want. The Win 8 is a cruel joke mouse trap. I could not find a single iPad mini browser with proper line justification (try opera for android), the Google 8 is a value marvelous but poor speakers, Visio 8 is very cheap ($50 used) has a good screen and excellent speakers excellent for netflix and audio books and music but slow proccessor still everybody should have one.

And the only decent keyboard is A.I.Type which seems only available in android.

This thing is the size and thickness of an old mouse pad and not much heavier. I believe it has built in mircast to mirror to your tv what is on your pad screen. Fast charge and long life perhaps ten hours. It fits in some shirt pockets."
B00DVFLJKQ,12,112,Love My Nexus 7 (2013),Jaycee2u,5,Yes,24-Jan-15,-,0,"In my opinion, the Nexus 7 (2013) is definitely an improvement over the 2012 version. I have had my 2012 version for well over two years and have thoroughly enjoyed it. It still looks like new and runs great, but after reviewing the specs on the 2013 version, I decided I needed to order one. I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED! This model is thinner, faster, better display (1920 x 1200) vs (1280 x 800), 2 GB memory - 2012 model only had 1 GB, rear camera and can be charged using a Qi wireless charger! The Asus Nexus product line have served me well over the past couple of years and I look forward enjoying this model for the next couple of years. And yes, I would recommend to family and friends!"
B00DVFLJKQ,12,113,good,Fujie,5,Yes,01-May-14,1,1,"After reading reviews about how many bad 2013 Nexus 7s were out there I was really afraid to buy one. I have the 2012 and it still works perfectly but I was looking to hand that down to my son and upgrade. I am VERY happy with my decision! The device is magnificent!
The only glitch I encountered was that it was set to ""speak"" when I turned it on (WHY??) which made inputting information via the touch screen challenging as I had to tap 3 or 4 times to get it to register (I thought I had a glitchy screen like so many others). Fortunately, I figured out how to do a hard reboot and did a factory reset then it fired right up and setting it up was a breeze!
I've had it for almost a month and I love it!! It's faster and the resolution is beautiful!!"
B00DVFLJKQ,12,114,Except this particular one apparently was a lemon: Over ...,Amazon Customer,4,Yes,21-Dec-15,-,0,"Except this particular one apparently was a lemon:

Over the first 2 days, with the battery completely charged, the device randomly completely shut down for no reason. This happened when opening various apps, opening Settings, or even just reading email or playing Solitaire. After 2 days, with battery still at 85% could not boot up past the ""Google"" text before the color animation. ""Google"" would appear and then screen would go black and not proceed. I was trying to reboot into ""safe"" mode to see if any particular app was causing the OS to crash, but I could not get far enough in the boot process to perform the ""reboot."" After this happened about a half-dozen times, I could not even get the word ""Google"" to appear. Something about it was completely hosed.

Amazon is usually very responsive for defective items, especially for Amazon Prime members, but would not automatically replace it. We have to send it back and have them receive it before issuing a refund and separately purchase the device again. This is quite inconvenient since it was meant to be a Christmas gift and cash is a little short right at the moment."
B00DVFLJKQ,12,115,?? Battery a problem,JR,2,Yes,10-Feb-14,-,0,"I am changing my rating for this product. I have had it for 2 and a half years and the battery won't charge. The questions and answers for this product said that by the time the battery quit charging, it would be time to get an updated machine. But I notice Amazon is selling this product and it is still current. There is no cost effective way to replace the battery. So my only other option is to replace the device. The problem is not only the cost of the device (for which I get no increased performance), but also all the data and apps on the device. The real kicker is that I don't think the problem is that the battery won't hold another charge, but the plug on the tablet is defective. It has always been quirky. For this reason I am forced to withdraw my recommendation for this product."
B00DVFLJKQ,12,116,Beautiful device,S. Jaber,4,Yes,27-May-14,1,0,"This thing is awesome. I bought it as a supplement for my phone and my laptop - something that I could take with me on plane trips or when traveling and don't want to lug my laptop with me. I wanted to use this primarily for surfing the web, social media, watching movies and shows, and reading books. The 2013 Nexus 7 works beautifully for those purposes.

It has a sleek design and is extremely light, and the screen quality is tremendous. The battery lasts forever even with heavy usage. I've gotten so much use out of this since I bought it that I barely need to touch my laptop anymore.

If I were to offer any criticisms, it's that the camera isn't that great. I mean, you shouldn't be using a tablet as your main camera anyway, but it would be nice if the quality was better for those times when your phone isn't handy and you need to take a picture of something happening right then. Flash would be a nice addition. Plus, the front-facing camera should definitely be better for a product that seems made for things like Skype and Google Hangouts. That's why it's only getting 4 stars from me.

Also, If you're looking to do more work-related things - like typing documents and such, it's not the best fit for it. But it will work in a pinch.

Otherwise, I would gladly recommend this product."
B00DVFLJKQ,12,117,Best 7 inch tablet out right now!,kujoe,5,Yes,27-Feb-14,1,0,"As usual I'm very happy to own another Nexus device. The form factor feels good in my hand. Even without a case it feels solid and easily gripped. Stock Android kit kat 4.4.2 is a pleasure to use, of course.

I choose 5 stars because I really do prefer a stock android environment. Google gets it right! Hopefully more and more manufacturers clue in that it's really best to let android be android and to stop customizing their android products with crappy customizations like Samsung Touchwiz, Motoblur and HTC Sense. The bonus to Google running the show is you immediately get updates as Google pushes them out.

The nexus 7 is fast, and snappy. I experience zero lag when opening apps or even multitasking across apps. I've had this tablet since November 2013 and it still feels like new! With 32 GB of space you'll also never run out of room for normal tasks such as reading ebooks, browsing online, listening to music, checking email or whatever.

I would highly suggest this over most any other tablet in this price range for this same form factor of 7 inches."
B00DVFLJKQ,12,118,Dont think it's good because it says Google on it.,Michael Taylor,1,Yes,23-Dec-18,-,0,Bought this 3 years ago. Has worked reasonably well with only minor problems until a week ago. It will not start up. It locks up when the google logo comes up making it an expensive paperweight. Researching the problem i have learned that thousands of owners have had the same issue for years. It seems that it is just a matter of time till they break. I've tried all of the fixes offered online and none work. Google wont fix it if its out of warranty and Asus wants $200 if you send it in. I wont buy another one but I'lll bet that Google won't care.
B00DVFLJKQ,12,119,greeat,Pete In Illinois,5,Yes,21-Dec-13,1,0,"Love it. but i do not like the sound. one side of the speakers went out just weeks after getting it. had to send it back and it was in fro repairs for 2 weeks. came back and the speakers worked, but now the volume is not what i am use to. when i have my nexus 5 phone al the way up people around me to turn it down. with the nexus 7's volume is all the way up no one notices. And when i use ear buds i can tell you i will never hurt my hearing. When i hooked up amplified speakers same thing. I wish i had bought this from google. I might not have had to wait for the repair. the only problem i have with the unit is the sound. other then that this is a great product. I lalso own a ASUS MeMo 7hd and it has better sound then the nexus."
B00DVFLJKQ,12,120,The Best,Mrs. Jones,5,Yes,28-May-14,1,0,"I had a 1st gen Nexus that just died one day. After trying to have it repaired, and being unsuccessful, I decided to replace it with the newer 2nd gen Nexus. It is perfect. I am not a tech savvy person, so I cannot wow you with all the specs. I just know it performs well, and I love the new features, especially the dual cameras. The old one was great for selfies, but very difficult to use when trying to photograph anything else. I also like that it has 32gb, where my old on only had 16. It is supposedly lighter weight, but only by a few oz, so that isn't really noticeable to me. I love the Nexus products, and this one is no exception."
B00DVFLJKQ,13,121,No Stars,ceMental,1,Yes,27-May-14,4,1,"Without warning and under a year this device failed. The touch screen is useless. for example if i just tap the letter m, it will repeat mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm within a second. this make it impossible to log in. if you're able to log in the device is still useless because of the touch screen ultra sensitivity.

I have taken care to handle this device and I had used a separate case for it. I tried a factory reset and the problem is still there."
B00DVFLJKQ,13,122,Bought a second one,Stuart T,5,Yes,01-Feb-14,-,0,"I use this thing all the time, having had it for five months now. The screen has held up great, and operating system has proven rock solid, and the apps, of course, are abundant.

One worry I had was if the tablet's battery completely drained. Would it seriously degrade the battery? Thankfully, when that day finally happened (and it will) I found no change in the battery life once it recharged.

Another thing I kept assessing during the first few months was whether I would buy one for my luddite wife, the one who knows how to browse and that's about it. The one who currently has an iPhone 4S. I took a chance after she really liked mine (vs. going with an iPad Mini) and bought one for her, too. Good call.

It's light, and if you want to keep it light be mindful of the case/cover you buy for it. I didn't make such a good choice there.

I still believe this to be the best 7-inch tablet available, and the best value."
B00DVFLJKQ,13,123,"THE BEST 7"" TABLET ON THE MARKET",Edward Pendleton,5,Yes,31-Jan-15,-,0,"Hands down the best 7"" tablet out there even though there is no MicoSD slot, that is not an issue unless you need more than 32GB of storage. You can use an OTG(On The Go) cable to attach just about any type or size of USB storage. Flashdrives, HDDs, Memory card readers/writers for SD cards of all type and sizes. If you look at it that way your storage is unlimited.
Very fast processor, 2MB ram(twice the usual amount of Ram) The screen has the highest resolution for 7"" tablets. Battery can last 6-8 hours depending how you are using it. Accessories are plentiful and easy to find. In my opinion... THE BEST 7"" TABLET ON THE MARKET"
B00DVFLJKQ,13,124,Best in Class,Monika,5,Yes,19-Oct-15,1,0,"Older tablet but still holds its own like most Nexus products. Great battery life & charging time. Performance and reliability is outstanding and impressive for a tablet that's a generation or two behind the current curve as of this writing in October 2015. I flash custom Android ROMs on my devices and that's a great advantage of owning a Nexus device. I'm able to flash custom ROMs that put my ""older"" tablet on par & succeeding current tablets on the market."
B00DVFLJKQ,13,125,"Sleek 7"" tablet",shyn,4,Yes,09-Jan-14,-,0,"The Nexus 7 is a well-built tablet with a gorgeous display. The super high dpi screen is beautiful, and a pleasure to use. It comes with Android 4.4 Kit Kat, which is delightful to use. The processor is powerful enough for apps to run fluidly without a hitch. Sound quality is excellent, and it is a comfort to hold up.

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS
Personally, I like to customize my devices a lot. Thus, I always buy Nexus devices, which will have the greatest support from the dev communities and will always get newest updates to ROMs first. For people who love trying out new stuff, a Nexus device (or any other AOSP-device) is a great choice. Battery life for the tablet is also pretty good. On heavy use, the battery can last an entire day.

ISSUES
As some others have noted, there are teething issues with the touch. I noticed that my drags are sometimes paused and cut off, though i didn't notice any phantom tap issues. Having rooted it and moved on to CyanogenMod, the issues have gone away, and even if you do not follow these steps, as others have noted, there are fixes for this.

OVERALL
This is a solid 7"" tablet with a very decent selling price. If you want connectivity on the go, get the one with LTE—it's worth it too."
B00DVFLJKQ,13,126,the nexus 7 still has the best reviews. Clean fast Android,Michael N,5,Yes,03-Feb-16,1,0,"I wanted to replace my beatup nexus 7 with a Samsung Galaxy with SD slot octacore and split screen functionality, but for now, the nexus 7 still has the best reviews. Clean fast Android, frequently updates, brightest 1080p scree(looks amazing), consistent fit and finish. Other candidates in my search had many bad reviews. The Samsungs are pretty, with loads more features, but half the reviews report deaminating screens and dying batteries, those with warranty stuck with refurbished replacements. Stuck with the nexus 7, playing it safe, but predictably high quality product."
B00DVFLJKQ,13,127,Absolutely awesome tablet in every way possible EXCEPT in one way,Narkhelek,3,Yes,16-Nov-13,4,1,"Absolutely awesome tablet in every way possible EXCEPT in one very important way. I've now received two of these and they both have had an issue where the touch screen will not reliably recognize touches if you aren't holding it or have it plugged in. For example, I cannot set it on the table in front of me and use the device. This is a very widely reported issue (check XDA forums for references and patch that may fix). There are people who are reporting that they do not have this issue but given that I'm 2 for 2, it is very probable that you will too.

If they were to fix this issue Asus/Google would have absolutely the best small form factor Android tablet on the market hands down.

I'm going to exchange it for the second time. I'll update on how the third performs."
B00DVFLJKQ,13,128,"Great tablet, but not without some issues",Pam,4,Yes,13-Jan-16,-,0,"A fantastic tablet from 2013 (which is recommended over the 2012 version) that still holds up today. I was in the market for a low cost tablet, and the Nexus 7 topped many recommendation lists because of it's performance for the price you pay. It also received the OTA update to Marshmallow 6.0.1 so you'll have the latest version of Android. (I had no trouble updating it out of the box [I did do a complete system restore between each update as recommended] and recently installed the latest security patch with no adverse effects to the tablet.) I do recommend getting the 32Gb version as this does not have an expandable memory slot.

Unfortunately not all is perfect. The tablet I received suffers from an apparently infamous grounding issue (in which sometimes a touch is not recognized when one isn't physically holding the tablet or if the tablet is in a case) which has been well documented online. As Amazon sold out of their stock shortly after I received my tablet (though it seems to be back in stock now) I decided to keep my unit and placed a piece of cardboard wrapped in foil behind the tablet when it's in a case and that seems to have lessened the issue (though it has not completely fixed it) for me.

If you're looking for a lower priced but not lower end tablet, do consider this version of the Nexus 7."
B00DVFLJKQ,13,129,My bargain companion,Mark A. Miller,5,Yes,25-Feb-15,-,0,"Great at what it is, and a great bargain. This is my second Nexus 7, the first being the Gen 1 model. I loved it so dearly I leapt on the chance to buy this upgraded model. Sure, there are other tablets with bigger screens, better cameras, a few other niceties, but they cost more and those frills are of no interest to me. I am disabled and spend most of my time in bed. This is small and light enough I can easily hold it in one hand and plenty big enough to read mail, check out Web sites, and watch movies from Netflix. It's plenty zippy enough and the display is 1920x1080, the perfect resolution for watching HD movies. It's great for playing most games, too, though for some it is a little too big as it's hard to cover the whole screen with your thumbs.

As for the negatives, they aren't things I care about much. The cameras are nothing special, but tablets make awkward cameras so I don't care. The front camera is perfectly adequate for Skype. If there is one feature I would like it is a MicroSD slot for expanding the storage. I have way too much music to fit in the 32gb of built-in memory. Still, no big deal, because at home I'm on WiFi, so downloading music I want to listen to is quick and easy. Only when I'm away from home would it be nice to have. Some competitors have this feature, but they are weaker in other respects or quite a bit more expensive. This is a wonderful tablet for such a low price."
B00DVFLJKQ,13,130,The best device I ever owned...,Frost T Pierce,5,Yes,24-Feb-15,-,0,"This device has so much potential, with a minor modification or two, I can honestly say it was one of the best investments I've made in a long time. I got a protective case that was flimsy and cheap, and replaced it with a Trident Aegis Series protective case, MIL-STD-810F. Don't buy any ""universal"" accessories for the Nexus 7, always get military grade cases and stuff specifically made for it. I also put 2 layers of Tech Armor on the screen. With unlimited data with 5GB 4G/LTE a month, an AWUS036NEH long range USB WIFI, an RTL-SDR / antenna kit, This device will do things I never imagined. I use it for work, school, and play. But, now they've gone from 7 and 9 to 6 and 10. If you have a chance for a Nexus 7 2013 2nd Gen LTE like new, buy it..."
B00DVFLJKQ,14,131,Best option for a small android tablet,Nick A,5,Yes,23-Jul-14,-,0,"This is my first tablet purchase after being on the fence for a long time. Overall, extremely satisfied with the product.

Hardware specs are good enough to run everything I've thrown at it so far. Screen looks amazing for media.

I opted for the 32gb version and I'm glad I did. If I would have gone with the 16gb I would have run out of space quickly. As it stands I'm at about 20gb of storage. Extra space is worth the extra cost.

Biggest selling point at least for me is the steady updates from google and the quick support. This is why I chose a nexus over the other android tablets out there. My biggest problem with the android ecosystem is the spotty update records of non nexus products. I have piece of mind on this purchase that I'm somewhat future-proofed for the next few cycles and I won't have to buy a new tablet just to get an is upgrade.

It isn't a laptop replacement, but that wasn't what I was looking for. I mainly use it for web browsing/email while traveling and media streaming/consumption. It can do minor office tasks but isn't suited for long term word processing or spreadsheets without a keyboard attachment. Even then I'd prefer a larger screen."
B00DVFLJKQ,14,132,Flaky hardware and software,BB in Seattle,1,Yes,09-Aug-14,-,0,"The tablet generally works but both the hardware and software are flaky and service is abominable. I had 2 hardware problems (loose charging port and flickering auto-brightness) under warranty. Asus makes it hard to figure out where to send it for service, and once I did, it was gone for 25 days -- unacceptable service in this day and age -- and even worse, the problems remained when they returned it. So now I have to send it again. Obviously, this won't work if you really need a tablet. Furthermore, Google's ""automatic backup"" software setting doesn't actually back up anything except your address book -- not settings, apps, app settings, app data, screen & folder layout, etc. I'm not impressed."
B00DVFLJKQ,14,133,A Good Choice,Hollis Miller,4,Yes,30-Nov-13,7,0,"This is an 11 year old child writing this review. This a good tablet. When I saw it in a store through the glass I thought it would be too small but 7 inches is plenty of screen. The speakers are pretty good and both the front-facing and rear-facing cameras are fine. I also like how you can do a 360 shot with the rear-facing camera. The start-up is fast and the voice recognition is a lot better than I thought it would be. I have 3 problems with this tablet. The first one, on the initial start-up you have to be connected to wi-fi to actually start using it. The second issue the screen can be unresponsive at times. And the final thing the battery life. The Nexus 7 runs out of battery very quickly and I always have the brightness on the lowest setting. I think this is a good tablet overall considering the price."
B00DVFLJKQ,14,134,Hello Android world !,John David - N.C.,5,Yes,20-Feb-14,1,0,"Love the Nexus 7 tablet. It worked perfectly from the start with lightning fast performance and crystal clear images. To be honest, I this is my first tablet and I do not have a fancy cell phone with 3G or 4G internet capability however my wife has an Apple Ipad and I have an Ipod. That said, the Nexus 7 is very impressive and for the price point, I would definitely suggest this tablet as a top choice. I also would look at the Kindle Fire product line. I chose the Android tablet over some of the others, but I feel that you can't loose with the technology and applications that are available today for the cost of one of these little jewels. Check them out and see for your self."
B00DVFLJKQ,14,135,"Nexus 7 tablet, 32 GB",preop,5,Yes,28-Jun-14,-,0,"I wanted something small that I could travel with and pick up wifi hotspots along the road. The size is perfect as it easily fits into a backpack, purse or a large pocket. It charged easily and I've had no problems with it (unlike some of the reviews I've read). It would be nice for some older folks to have some basic instructions on swiping which I had to learn from a younger person. I did not want this as a phone, just as an easy travel-tech aide which it is. Easy downloads but too many ads including in most downloads. Search on the web for free downloads (many say they are free but then they are only for a trial period)--which are truly free. I can now stay connected, play games and see where I am easily. Would buy this again!"
B00DVFLJKQ,14,136,Best present ever...,Jay Jaug,5,Yes,19-Aug-15,-,0,"Best Christmas present I ever got (for myself)!

I already saw several online reviews on this product and I was in the market for a small tablet. Although I'm not a heavy user, I've been around the iPad (1 and Air) and the Ipad Mini to know this is the one for me. The graphics are very good for the games I play (I don't need the Retina Display). The size and weight are right on, plus getting 32G for less than $300 is a bargain no matter what. I highly recommend this to any casual user who's on a budget and who's not sold on the fruit company from Cupertino, CA.."
B00DVFLJKQ,14,137,A world Class Leader!,Mic,5,Yes,23-Feb-15,-,0,"What can one say about the fabulous Nexus 7 that has not already been said by so, so many. This has been, and continues to be the very best 7 inch pure Android tablet known to humankind! The only sad thing is that it may soon become unavailable! I would urge you to buy 2 as I cant imagine what else one could want or need of any great importance! Keep one in the drawer in the event you drop one in the toilet, sink or run it over with your Lexus. Now that mine is running Lollipop, life is as good as it can be. We can only hope that Google finds some way of making the Nexus 7 even better and re-releases it in 2016!"
B00DVFLJKQ,14,138,Best Tablet I Have Ever Owned,Kindle Customer,5,Yes,16-Jun-14,-,0,"I currently have a Nexus, Kindle Fire, and 2 Samsung tablets and the Nexus is the go to tablet for most everything. It is small enough to hold in the palm of one hand and let the other hand control the functions of the device. In the 7 inch size, it is one of the brightest and sharpest screens on the market. Reading feels natural (the screen is about the size of supermarket paperback). Service from Google and Amazon was above what was expected when I forgot to recharge and they were extremely patient and gentle with me. The unit has updated itself twice with advanced OS, something that others do not offer as quickly. At this price you can't go wrong if you like working with Android devices."
B00DVFLJKQ,14,139,Great tablet!,JeninNM,5,Yes,11-Feb-14,-,0,"I researched for 2 months before finally deciding on the Nexus 7 over the iPad mini. Apple's price gouging is out of control! This tablet goes with me everywhere and I use it daily. I love that I can use my phone as a hotspot when there is no wifi available. I enjoy personalizing everything. And the screen resolution is fantastic!

WARNING though, if you let the tablet battery die completely you will get the 5 white lights of death (or whatever people call it). I let mine get to about 7% then charge it fully. If it dies, you will likely panic when it takes an hour or so to finally turn back on after you place it on the charger.

I laugh at people who spend hundreds more on Apple products. Just take care of your purchases and there is no problem spending a little less."
B00DVFLJKQ,14,140,Best tablet I have owned,Nate B.,5,Yes,23-Jul-14,-,0,"I have had this tablet for months. It has continually a pleasure to use. The only complaint I have is that there is no micro sd card slot. It has handled everything I have thrown at it. No major slow downs to date. There are no real signs of use on it with pretty much daily use prior to buying I thought it might be too small since I was coming from a 10"" tf101 but it had turned out to be a great/comfortable to hold as well as view. Like I said previously the only con I have is the lack of expandable storage but it makes up for it with all of it other perks. A huge positive is that there is no major bloatware. Out of the box it is lean and clean. It is the best tablet I have owned to date and I prefer it to my fiancee's iPad mini."
B00DVFLJKQ,15,141,Great device! I've had this for quite a while ...,Glenn Johnson,5,Yes,21-Jan-16,-,0,"Great device!

I've had this for quite a while now and I did notice that the orientation sensor seems to be having issues. It's a known thing, forum posts abound describing tablets that won't switch between portrait and landscape properly. The issue seems to be with the sensor itself. Get an app called Adaptive Rotation Lock, and just set it manually for whatever orientation you need. It's a bit of a pain but it's a minor issue really.

This only happened recently and I bought this thing probably a year ago or more. I use it every day and love it."
B00DVFLJKQ,15,142,"Have Nexus, will travel",Glenn C.,5,Yes,07-Feb-15,-,0,"Well made unit, ideal for travel. While I prefer the size of the screen of my 10-inch Samsung ""Google pad"", that particular unit has the unfortunate tendency to turn on and stay on if you bump it accidentally (plus, the 10 inch is not exactly pocket friendly). As for this 7-inch device, having to hold the ON button down for a full 7 seconds before it will start can be annoying during regular use, but it is really nice to find that it hasn't turned itself on and run down the battery while still in your luggage. Incidentally, I have found other uses for these useful devices, but I bought them both originally to have something portable to run Google Translate on. Great travel app."
B00DVFLJKQ,15,143,No regrets - Love this!,Average Joe,5,Yes,12-Jan-14,1,0,"I really like the size of this tablet: it's the perfect size for reading a book one handedly. With the Poetic case, I have a firm grip on it in the subway and don't have to worry about getting it bumped out of my hand. The screen is lovely and very bright. I've turned it down to less than 50% brightness which also gives me great battery life. I only have to charge it every other day. I got the mini USB OTG cable to connect a flash drive, but it won't work without a paid App or a rooting. I have a lite app that will read files smaller than 30Mb, but not found a free solution yet. 32 GB has been big enough so far. I would recommend this to a friend."
B00DVFLJKQ,15,144,Great Tablet but issues USB connection,Donna C,4,Yes,19-May-14,-,0,"I have only had this for a few days, but so far, I think it's great. Clarity is great, loads very fast, and looks classy.

Product Update: there seems to be an issue with cable connection. When I connect the cable to the Nexus 7 it doesn't really set correctly, & I have to wiggle it around just to get it to charge. I know I'm not the only one that has experienced this as I have read reviews from others stating the same problem. I contacted Amazon to advise them of this issue and because it's beyond the 30 days they do not stand behind the product that they sold to me. that makes me very unhappy, as I have purchased many items from Amazon and I would hope they would treat their customers a little better when there is an issue."
B00DVFLJKQ,15,145,Great device and great Amazon service in the face of dead pixels,Spencer Hersom,5,Yes,24-Nov-13,1,0,"The screen is fantastic, it's very fast, the sound is fairly decent and all in all, I just love using this thing. A simple general review. But hey, if you want an in-depth review, I wouldn't look for one here; there are better sites that are dedicated to reviewing the hardware and software of all the new tech.

However, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another piece of tech from Amazon. My first one had some dead pixels, just a few, but there was one set that was all white and were distracting when the brightness was up and it was a dark screen. I got onto a chat with an Amazon support person and was able to confirm that they would send a new one and that I'd be able to compare the two and keep the better one. I didn't want to go through all the hassle of returning my current one and then be out of a tablet while waiting for a new one to arrive, especially if the new one was even worse off; and I didn't have to. The new one came two days later, and that's what I'm using to write this review. No dead pixels and this thing is just great."
B00DVFLJKQ,15,146,"Affordable, powerful, but not as resistant as previous model",Carlos,3,Yes,08-Oct-15,-,2,"Great tablet for the money, but sadly, it wasn't as resistant as the previous model. The screen developed problems with touch sensitivity and ghosting after 3 months, which made it almost impossible to use most of the time. It wasn't a software problem but a hardware problem. Then not long after, the charging port wasn't working right. I had to hold the cable at a certain angle to make my tablet charge or connect with a computer, with it getting worse and worse to connect, and just two weeks ago, it stopped being able to charge. Now the thing is dead and I am hoping the wireless charger I ordered will bring it back to life long enough for me to transfer my files to a usb drive or to an online cloud.

The first generation was more resistant compared to this one. One time my brother got angry for some dumb reason, took my tablet, and slammed it repeatedly against the wooden floor, with the screen facing it! I was sure the thing was broken. Thankfully though when I took it away from him, it was actually working like nothing, not even a scratch! Hopefully if they release a 3rd version of the Nexus 7, it will be more durable."

My husband got me this for Christmas. It was not something that I had thought about, much less wanted for Christmas. When I opened it, I was a little afraid. I am not much of a ""techie"" kind of person. Knowing this, my sweet husband programmed it for me ahead of time. The screen is good sized with vivid colors. The icons can be set from small to very large, which is a plus for me, so that I don't have to dig around for my glasses. The apps are no different than the cell phone. I am still discovering it's features, which include Netflix, Google Chrome, etc. Also got a screen cover, case cover, and usb host cable . All working great!"
B00DVFLJKQ,15,148,"Great Value, Good Construction. Just get it.",Byron,5,Yes,22-Nov-13,2,0,"This device is well worth the money. Currently it is the most powerful Android tablet on the market, and it shows. It's fast, and beautiful. Small, but perfect for reading books and comics on and watching tv in bed. Essential apps: HuluPlus, Plex, Marvel Unlimited, Amazon Kindle, Cool Reader, Comic Book Rack, Super GNES, TTorrent, Dolphin Web Browser (can run Flash with the Legacy Flash App installed), Netflix, Crackle, FPse (playstation roms), PINBALL ARCADE (so this). I also recommend Max Payne and the Room for games. Go ahead and pay the extra for the 32 gig version, it's worth it. The screen is fantastic, with brightness levels that are at times absurd. Haven't really used the camera much except to test skype, and it's good. Also has built in simulated surround support for apps that support it, like netflix. I got mine used and it was in perfect condition, if you're looking to shave a few dollars off of the price, getting a used one is not a bad idea. Anyways, very impressed and satisfied with my purpose. I use it to update my blog and do all sorts of other things. Only complaint is with Android, it's still an operating system that is hindered by device fragmentation. With out the ability to optimize for devices all Android apps have silly bugs and can be sluggish at times, with occasional freezes. It's not a deal breaker but it makes what is an overpowered device sometimes seem like an underpowered one, but this is a problem with all Android devices and would be considerably worse in a lesser powered device."
B00DVFLJKQ,15,149,LOVE!,Giyen,4,Yes,27-Nov-13,2,0,"I mostly love this tablet. It's my first one, so I can't compare it to the ipads/Apple family of products but I also paid 1/2 the amount had I bought a mini. I love the Android platform and for the price, it is great! I use it all the time and I am now thinking of getting rid of my laptop and getting a desktop (since the laptop now seems so bulky).

The Kindle and Overdrive apps plus the AWESOME Seattle Public Library digital collection have actually encouraged me to read more books. The only thing that has made me sad is that the charger port is loose and the micro USB cord falls out easily and the screen and back cover has come loose in one corner, which I found out by trying to pull my tablet out of it's cover. It has not affected my usage or performance of the tablet at all."
B00DVFLJKQ,15,150,Amazing!!,sharnity,5,Yes,19-May-14,-,0,"The way I want the tablet to be.. handy, robust, flexible, fast. I have been using this one since more than a week now and the more am using the more am loving and getting addicted to it. My 3 year old kid also use this one sometimes for few minutes and he's crazy for this and likes it as this is so easy to use.
Only the one drawback is its power and volume buttons which I always finds hard to finds in low lights with a touch, but never mind.

I got introduced to this by my developer colleague who also code games for android. I took this as refurbished by google.. and having 90 days warranty from Google itself. Got a good deal!
Overall is a good product."
B00DVFLJKQ,16,151,I Approbe This Product,ZMAR,5,Yes,31-Oct-16,-,0,"This tablet is excellent, 2 years later and still going strong. I was looking before purchase the 16 GB to save some money. But oh boy I didn't regret getting the 32gb because I end up using this tablet for so many things. That knowing I have the extra storage gives me peace of mind about space. When you have this tablet and use it for many things like I do it feels like another companion with the rights apps in it."
B00DVFLJKQ,16,152,OK if not for amazon movies,Bob HYN,4,Yes,29-Nov-13,1,2,"It's OK, it's fast, but it does come bloated with apps you cannot delete, and 10 of its 32 gbs are already allocated. Google will then force you to create an account, force you, so you can use it. It must be google, and you must agree to their use of your information. The biggest downfall for those reading this is you cannot download things you've already or will purchase from amazon--media. Google and amazon are at war with iPads so they try to remain exclusive--bottom line, you'll have to re-purchase movies in google play that you have purchased at amazon.

Screen is nice, but not the second coming as it is described elsewhere."
B00DVFLJKQ,16,153,Warranty service is non-existent.,Not Public,2,Yes,10-Aug-16,-,0,"Warranty service is terrible. It took me three days and three phone calls to get an RMA from ASUS. Then it took another week and four phone calls for them to acknowledge that they had received it, even though the carrier tracking reported it delivered. Now it has sat with status waiting for repair for two weeks. After being put on hold repeatedly they tell me they are waiting for a part and have no idea when it will be in. I asked them to escalate it and send me a new tablet if necessary. They said it had already been escalated (in order to get the acknowledgement that they had received it) and they could do nothing more. I asked them to connect me to somebody that could solve the problem. They I was connected to a supervisor who said he was sorry but could do nothing. I could not get transferred to anyone who could solve the problem. So four weeks and counting I have no tablet and no idea when I will have one.

Don't get any Nexus device unless the warranty is provided by Google. Google will immediately ship a replacement device and you ship back the defective device. ASUS will not do that.

The device, when it works, is great."
B00DVFLJKQ,16,154,Very nice display and very small too,Jacob,5,Yes,01-Apr-15,2,0,"Very nice display and very small too. Normally I don't care about the size of a device, but I fitted my Nexus 7 2013 into the stock nav-hood of my RX-8. Note for anyone who wants to do that: get the 2012 version. The 2013 is just slightly wider and it will make your life a whole lot harder.

The device itself works very well, if a little under-powered. For general use you'll never even notice."
B00DVFLJKQ,16,155,I liked this pad when I first bought it,Jeff,1,Yes,29-Dec-15,-,0,"I liked this pad when I first bought it, but with time I've come to loath the little beast. Auto rotate fails repeatedly. Sometimes the touch pad itself is completely non responsive. It's probably the most unreliable piece of hardware I've ever owned.

Updating to add that this POS has gotten worse! Password pattern method fails because the pad freezes and won't accept the beginning of the pattern...or the end. Finally smashed the thing in pure frustration and will never buy another Asus or Nexus pad product."
B00DVFLJKQ,16,156,Have fun!,D. Fincher,5,Yes,10-Dec-13,3,0,"My chief concern before making this purchase was whether or not the screen would be large enough to suit my needs. I was eying a Nexus 10, but since it seems likely to me that there is not going to be a new Nexus 10, I took the plunge for this one. So far, the 7 inch screen has worked very well for me. A bonus is that the tablet is much easier to hold in one hand.

A second concern was the lack of an SD card slot. Therefore I opted for the 32GB model. However, there is an option of getting a USB cable/adapter that allows plugging in a USB thumb drive.

I'm having lots of fun with my Nexus 7!"

The 2013 Nexus 7 is definitely an improvement from the 1st generation version. With the update to Android 4.4.2 it is very snappy and responsive.

The only thing I noticed is that the battery doesn't last as long as the 1st gen. Although, that could be because I have a refurbished item but it isn't a significant difference that I'm unhappy with it.

Overall, the Nexus 7 is awesome. Its slim enough to fit in my back pocket and light enough to carry it around everywhere. This is a must buy!"
B00DVFLJKQ,16,159,A Superb Tablet,T. Poe,5,Yes,28-Apr-14,2,0,"I was initially hesitant to buy the Nexus 7, mostly due to the lack of an SD card slot. However, I mostly use my tablet for video games, reading and streaming media (YouTube and the like) and in the end, an SD card slot was redundant for my needs.

The screen on the Nexus 7 is responsive and very bright and crisp. I haven't had any issues with lagging or crashing to speak of and it seems to support just about any app I should wish to run on it.

Really, for my needs, this is the perfect tablet."

I still don't like the closed architecture of movies on google play nor iTunes, but I will keep buying dvds until true openness occurs in digital movies.

Pro: as close to perfection as possible

And the hardware specs are so appealing at this low price, meantime the quality is rather accessible. So overall, this tablet works as expected most of the time...
However, the randomly reboot problem is a bit annoying. This problem seems to be weird, as it often happens while the tablet is in idle state, e.g. while I'm just leaving it aside on the table, and when I'm using it, it seems rather stable... Tried several different version of systems (including stock 4.3, 4.4.2, and some third party OS) the problem persists... Google, please fix this!"
B00DVFLJKQ,17,163,Convinced to switch to Android and Nexus,Nathan,5,Yes,02-Jan-14,-,0,"I've owned all Apple products for the last few years, while my friends have had Android. I wasn't bothered by the higher prices of Apple devices because of the superior build quality and great software. I have always always always adored Apple's way of making their products so clean and elegant. ...That is until I got this tablet.

The 2013 Nexus 7 is a gorgeous device. I was looking for a cheaper tablet, so when I saw this one, I decided to give it a chance -- and boy do I love it. The device doesn't feel cheaply made or fragile at all! I'm very impressed by the caliber of the build. The side buttons are a little wonky (seems too high sometimes) but other than that, I have no gripes about the 2013 N7.

I won't say too much about Android since this is about the tablet, but boy do I love Android. Apple and iOS is great, but Android is really coming along and rivals much of iOS. I particularly like Android on the N7 because it is pure. There is no Samsung crapware or anyone else's crapware. Just pure Google software.

The Nexus 7 alone has convinced me to switch to Android. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."

I have several tablets, including an ipad and a kindle fire, and this is the one I bring with me everywhere lately. I love the Google/gmail integration and just how amazing this screen is. Every app worth having is available on Android as well as Ios so who cares if there are 80 bazillion apps for ios, most of them are crap anyway.

To be fair, Im not giving up my ipad over this-I like having multiple tablets in different form factors for different uses. This one is great for being your bring -everywhere tablet and is also a great alternative if you dont have 600 bucks to spend on an ipad."

It automatically uploads my pics to the cloud they let you have. Can't say enough about how great this tablet is. My complaint is some of them do not automatically update the time when you change time zones, ergo, I have to manually update it where ever I am or just remember I am an hour ahead or behind. I wish they would fix this glitch. Yes I know there is a setting for auto update, but it doesn't seem to work, bummer."
B00DVFLJKQ,17,166,great tablet,Kindle Customer,4,Yes,15-Feb-14,-,0,I have nothing to compare this too so for me it is a great tablet. Poor instructions on using so its a matter of try it and hope it works. Personally I would not get less than the 32 GB storage. As a reader on the app I use the adds get in the way. With trial and error I found that setting it to read a full paragraph instead of a single page moves the add to the top of the tablet and does not cover up the bottom lines of the book I am reading. So much going on in the background that the battery is used up pretty fast. Have to charge it quite often but that's not too bad. Overall I am thoroughly satisfied. Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt.
B00DVFLJKQ,17,167,(please note that this product is sold c/ asus hardware and android (google) firmware) And let me put the record straight the pr,Varun,3,Yes,13-Dec-14,1,0,"I have used this tablet for past 1.5 year since purchase.
I am about to buy a ipad mini or another product.

For the first year the nexus worked quite well.

But then the touchscreen problems started occuring.
I tried to call google but they stated this is a hardware issues and when I called Asus they were not helpful and turfed me back to google. (please note that this product is sold c/ asus hardware and android (google) firmware)

And let me put the record straight the product is great when it works. My wife has a ipad mini and she has never had a touchscreen issue.
Of note, the touchscreen just doesn't respond. you have to restart and reset the tablet and still the hardware issue persists.

I understand the conundrum google has as the asus factory has pushed out quite a few of these bad apples and a major recall will mean millions of dollars for them and admitting fault means replacing the entire hardware for the touchscreen but it is bad for someone like me who spent >$200 and now has to look for another tablet only a year later.

B00DVFLJKQ,17,168,Good tablet.. when it works.,Ngg971,2,Yes,01-Dec-14,-,1,"The tablet is great - when it works. Something about the hardware/software was poorly designed, because it is constantly malfunctioning.

Unfortunately, due to repeated hardware issues, I've cycled through 3 tablets in the last 6 months, and am about to need a new one yet again.
I had originally bought the 2012 version, and after a year of use it stopped turning on. After a painstaking troubleshooting session with the ASUS online support (you have to manually press different buttons on the side and navigate a confusing boot menu in order to do a factory reset), it became clear I had to send in the tablet for servicing. The process, which entails submitting an ""RMA"", is long and tedious. From the day I shipped to getting the new one, I had to wait about 6 weeks.
I finally get my new tablet.. and within 2 weeks of receiving it, it stops working. Once again, I try all sorts of troubleshooting but it won't get past the load screen. At this point I don't want to endure another servicing and decide to just buy the 2013 version, hoping all my troubles will go away.
Lo and behold, I encountered YET ANOTHER type of hardware issue within weeks of buying it - the tablet often and randomly restarts itself. At this point I don't know if I should just trash this piece of junk and buy an iPad mini or try to get it serviced yet again..

To recap: 3 different types of issues over the course of a few months, you have to really wonder about the quality of these tablets."
B00DVFLJKQ,17,169,Another Great Tablet by Google,Russ H.,5,Yes,21-Apr-14,1,0,"It seems like all I give out are 4 or 5 star reviews. I guess I do my research well and rarely buy something that performs poorly.

I bought this for my 11yr old son. He LOVES it! Most gadgets lose his attention after a week or two. We're solidly into the 2nd month and he still uses this thing practically every day!

I own the original Nexus 7 myself and his is WAY better. I think the updated processor combined with double (2gb) the RAM makes this a much smoother tablet. This thing is SNAPPY FAST! I'm a big jealous!"
B00DVFLJKQ,17,170,"Beware of Google Screen of Death - Once your 1 year warranty is over, good luck getting support.",P. W. Lee,1,Yes,02-Mar-15,6,3,"Bought this unit in August 2013. Flash ahead 1 year 7 months later... this morning i open up my device to see this Google Screen. I get to this screen of death where my only options are to try to reboot it or reset it. I can get it to get to some sort a screen to pick one of 4 options. Start and Recovery Mode takes me back to the same Google Screen. Power Off just turns it off. Upon restarting it will take me back to this Google screen. Restart Bootloader takes me back to these 4 options. I contacted ASUS and similar to other people, they gave me a RMA. Not sure at this point it's worth sending it back as it's out of warranty. They said they will look at it once it's in their hands. It could potentially cost $100 to fix; otherwise they will ship it back for free. We'll see how this turns out. I spent $269 for this device, and I don't think i will be purchasing another Nexus anytime soon. At this point i don't know if it's an ASUS issue or a Google Lollipop OS update issue. Many people on android forums seem to be blaming Google over Asus. Maybe I will go try out a kindle device. At least it's cheaper than the Nexus and you know Amazon will stand by it's product and you can easily get a hold of Amazon Customer Service.

I called Google for support. Forget about it. Their response was if you had purchased it via our PLAY STORE, then we can help you. Since you bought it from Amazon, you need to deal with ASUS. I asked for a supervisor, and they were all busy and they told me they would call me when one was available. 24 hours later, there still hasn't been a call."
B00DVFLJKQ,18,171,Great Product,Jay,5,Yes,21-Mar-14,2,0,"I supposedly bought this for school but i use it more than i do my phone. People often come up to me and ask me if this is a new phone and i laugh. Great tablet, fast, reliable and has a great resolution! 1920x1200 not like some tables that give you something like 1280x800 which is such a low res to look at. Text is clear and very smooth when switching tabs. I stream videos from my computer to this tablet and have not one issue (i stream off of my gaming pc with a 8 core CPU overclocked to 4.5Ghz so your mileage may vary) but i also put movies on the actual tablet. Some formats dont play but you can get around that with downloading another media player."
B00DVFLJKQ,18,172,Device won't even turn on,Pablo Ortega,1,Yes,13-May-14,2,2,"As sad as it sounds, this is the third Google Nexus device that I'm returning because it came totally dead and nothing, not even the most awckward things published online, would make it work. I already tried everything and nothing would revive it.

In the past I had to return two Nexus 4 because they suddenly died and stopped working, charging or turning on. This is the third device, but this time the Nexus 7 arrived totally dead. I wasn't even able to turn it on for the first time. It simply won't come on.

I'm a big fan of Google but, come on, I'm starting to get tired of this..."
B00DVFLJKQ,18,173,What did I get into? Lol,Sissy,3,Yes,20-Dec-18,-,0,First time owning one so I could watch movies. I connected to Google and chrome and it pulled all my info from my phone on to this notebook. I don't like that and am going to have to figure out how to get rid of it.
B00DVFLJKQ,18,174,"My wife asked for an IPad, I gave her this, she loves it",KnumbKnuts,5,Yes,16-Jan-14,-,0,"My wife has a Galaxy S3 phone and asked for an IPad for her business (to give presentations in Starbucks). I figured I'd stick with the Android OS, did some research, and bought her this.

She had some initial concerns about its size, but it actually is in her sweet spot, fitting in her purse, yet big enough to show presentations to a few others on.

While she wanted it for her business, it appears to be her portable spotify machine. I need to get some bluetooth speakers, because the built in ones are fairly tinny.

But, all in all, it's a good use of $300. My wife is technophobic but loves this device."
B00DVFLJKQ,18,175,poor battery charging,KentuckyGuy,2,Yes,13-Mar-14,-,1,"I purchased the Nexus 7 in Sept 2013 to replace my first generation Nexus 7. Suffice it to say, I like the operating system, the screen, the logic, the connectivity. However, last week (after 6 months) I took the Nexus out to use after being hooked up to a charger all night and it was dead. I thought possibly a problem with the charger so I used another one that I had. Dead. Hmmm, I thought. That's a rare event to have both chargers go bad at once. But I ordered another charger and hooked it up. Dead. I got on the internet and found that the Nexus 7 has a problem with suddenly losing the ability to charge. It apparently has something to do with the mini-usb connection. So I downloaded a widget that monitors whether it is charging and discharging and plugged the Nexus 7 in. Sure enough, it was discharging even though it was hooked up to the new charger. So for 15 minutes I kept plugging and unplugging the unit until I finally got a connection that was charging at around 1,000 ma. I had to move rooms. I did not disconnect the mini-usb, simply unplugged. When I replugged the charger in to a different outlet, it now only has 400 ma. Go figure. If this were an isolated event I could forgive. But this is evidently a design flaw because I read of many people having this problem. I would give the unit 4.5 stars other than this really significant issue."
B00DVFLJKQ,18,176,I had heard good things,BBFlash,5,Yes,22-Jun-14,1,0,"I had heard good things and read great reviews on the Google Nexus. But now that I own one I can say it is truly the best tablet I have ever held or worked with and I train older retired adults how to use their Apple IPads, Apple IPhones, Galaxy Tablets and Phones and all manner of other Android smartphones and Tablets, new and older models. The picture is crisp the sound is amazing for its size and movies on it are almost 3D. It is fast and never runs out of memory. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent tablet."
B00DVFLJKQ,18,177,not worth it!! will stop working in a matter of months.,Tania L,1,Yes,12-Apr-15,-,0,"I'm really not happy with this tablet. A couple of months into this tablet the touch sensitivity seems to have disappeared, it doesnt respond very well or sometimes at all to your touch. It's very frustrating especially if you have games for your kids or yourself. After about 1 year into having it, itb.f stopped charging, when i connect it to its charger it wont charge unless I position it in a weid way but then after a while it stopped charging at all. This tablet is not worth it!! Dont waste your money. Go with the galaxy one instead."
B00DVFLJKQ,18,178,i purchased a referbished one and i'm very happy with it,jim,5,Yes,04-Mar-15,1,0,"Very fast shipping thank you. This nexus7 is so much faster than my old nexus, i purchased a referbished one and i'm very
happy with it. it came with the tablet and charger. i fully charged it and synced it up, after a few updates i checked out the movie and music quality and it sounded like it had surround sound compared to the 1st nexus, the gaming is great from the higher resolution screen
and double speakers. i love this tablet"
B00DVFLJKQ,18,179,"the resolution is great, and the battery life is good too (I ...",Christine,5,Yes,25-Sep-14,1,0,"The first tablet I received worked well for about a day and then the touch screen stopped working. I tried several things to fix it, including contacting customer service about the issue, but I eventually returned the product.

I was a little skeptical about asking for a replacement product after the first one died so quickly, but it seems it was just a dud. I've now had my Nexus for about 5 months, and it's still going strong. I originally intended to use it for entertainment, but I've ended up using it to take lecture notes, check email as well as watching Netflix, playing Spotify, reading books, and a number of other things. In fact, I'm using it to type this review. The device stands up to everything I ask of it, the resolution is great, and the battery life is good too (I just charged the battery last night for the first time in 3 days after keeping it on through my classes, using it for homework and watching a few YouTube videos here and there). For a tablet that was about $250, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who'd like a multipurpose tablet.

The one thing I noted however is that the 7'' screen is a little small for taking written notes. I still manage it with a relatively slim stylus, but if you intend to buy a tablet solely for writing or drawing, you may want a device with a larger screen."
B00DVFLJKQ,18,180,The best Android tablet I've used,Chris Purdy,5,Yes,05-Mar-14,2,0,"When my girlfriend got her iPad mini, I was jealous. It seemed like the perfect sized tablet, with a beautiful display, but I really couldn't afford one, nor did I want to be confined by iOS. Along comes Asus with the new 2013 Nexus 7, and this is the device I've been looking for. It's absolutely incredible.

Pros:
- It's the perfect size in your hand, with a very slick design.
- The aspect ratio is a perfect balance between iPad and wider screens.
- 320dpi ""Retina""-equivalent display, looks better than iPad mini.
- 1920x1200 resolution is perfect for watching HD streaming content.
- Wide color gamut and improved contrast ratio give movies a theatrical quality and photos just look mesmerising.
- Color reproduction is incredibly accurate.
- Snapdragon processor is wicked fast, even with Nova launcher, live backgrounds, tons of apps open at once, this tablet doesn't choke.
- USB OTG compatible, I can monitor and control my DSLR during shoots.
- 32gb is a decent amount of internal storage.
- Decent battery life, but not the best I've seen.
- Front and back facing cameras, great for Skype, Snapchat, etc.
- It's under $300 new, what?!? That's crazy.

Cons?:
- No 4G in this model so you must use WiFi.
- No microSD slot so memory is not expandable.
- You must root if you want external storage support.
- No HDMI out for connecting to TV.
- Mediocre camera quality."
B00DVFLJKQ,19,181,Best purchase I've made in a long time,Stephen the Ex Monk,5,Yes,14-Aug-15,1,0,"Best purchase I've made in a long time. I hesitated to buy a tablet even though I'm a commited geek. Just couldn't justify the cost of what would satisfy my wants. When I had a long trip for a funeral on my calendar, I decided to take the plunge so I could take a long some e-books. Both as an e-reader and all around tool, it's indispensable. Great for note taking and such. Maybe I'll upgrade to a 10"" at some point."
B00DVFLJKQ,19,182,I bought the 16gb nexus 7 from best buy and it worked well,Aaron,3,Yes,11-Aug-14,1,1,I bought the 16gb nexus 7 from best buy and it worked well. I gave it to my wife as I needed more storage. I am still using this device bought on amazon 6 months later but it has an issue with the touch screen becoming unresponsive every once in awhile. It is then needing a reboot to get it working again. Problem is you need the touch screen to reboot cause you can't pull the battery on the device. Not sure why I have this issue but I would suggest buy direct from google not amazon.
B00DVFLJKQ,19,183,Best 7 inch tablet,Wyatt,5,Yes,18-Dec-14,1,0,"Overview
- Bought this for my 9 year old son to replace the kindle

Pros
- great screen - high resolution, great color spectrum, very fluid
- performance - no lag or wait time
- nexus device - being a google nexus you get a tighter integration with google products and services

Cons
- none - i would buy this again in a second, I have recommended this to many people including people who are thinking of buying an ipad mini"
B00DVFLJKQ,19,184,The best tablet for the money. Nearly flawless.,Ken Blum,5,Yes,12-Dec-14,1,0,"After researching for hours for a really good tablet that didn't break the bank we bought this. My 11 year old son actually paid for it and he has had it since early October, 2014. He loves it. He can play every game that he likes and it handles video and everything else he does such as math apps...etc with ease. It is nearly flawless with or without a wireless signal. It is the perfect size to use at home or on the road. Last year he got a Microsoft Windows 8 RT tablet. What a disappointment that was. I highly recommend this Nexus 7 by Asus."
B00DVFLJKQ,19,185,Loving it so far,Abyssal Chronicles,5,Yes,01-Jan-14,1,1,"So far, I can say I'm really loving the Nexus 7 2nd Gen. There are a few cons, but the pros outshine them so very, very well.

Pros:
- This, by far, is one of the most heavy-duty tablets I've ever tried. As soon as I got it online, it updated to Kitkat and that's really great. It could take practically all the heavy games I could put on it and most of the apps I ran on it worked perfectly.

- The screen size is actually just right. At first, I thought it'd be too small, but after using it for a week, it was pretty much just right for my needs. My lecture files read perfectly, and even drawing on it is pretty smooth.

- The glass is strong, all right. I wasn't able to place a screen protector so I used it for a week without one. After a little cleaning with a microfiber towel, the tablet looked as good as new. Not a scratch in sight.

- Movies look splendid on it, especially in HD.

- Wifi is really fast. It connects to our school wifi no problem and runs the net at very good speeds.

- Transferring files is a breeze after getting Nexus Media Importer from Google Play. There may be no SD card slot, but with NMI I can attach practically any USB drive to it.

Cons:
- I noticed that after playing really heavy games (i.e. Little Inferno or #Sworcery), the tablet heats up at the area of the camera/power button really, really fast. It's not just ""warm,"" it's really hot. Not painfully hot, but hot nonetheless. Gameplay of around 30 minutes already causes it to heat up. It's made me stop playing these heavy games for extended periods of time.

- That's pretty much all I can complain about. This tablet is great and I'd recommend it to practically anyone."
B00DVFLJKQ,19,186,Great Product for a great price.,Taya,5,Yes,12-Dec-14,1,0,"This is a gift for my daughter for Christmas and as I was personalizing it to be ready for her when she opens up her gift on Christmas morning, I fell in love with this device. It has all the features I was looking for. This product is a great product for an amazing price. I also have all the space to add all the apps. she needs to help her growing mind, and it's a perfect size. I would recommend this to anyone, whether that be for themselves or for their little ones."
B00DVFLJKQ,19,187,My only review ever - highlighting the pitfalls of ASUS support,Lim LS,3,Yes,11-Aug-14,2,1,"In short, a good tablet whilst it works but good luck to you if there is a hardware issue.

My son and I shared this device from Singapore contently for the last 11 months until I had issues hooking it up for a charge. Until then it was strong alternative to more popular tablet brands.

It's been over three weeks now since I handed it into ASUS to repair and I'm still to get a confirmed date for when the device will be repaired. So far I've only been told that the motherboard needs to be replaced and that my device needs to get wiped and so lose all my paid apps and my son loses all the levels he'd worked up to. With this consequence in mind I've asked multiple times for a one for one replacement - to no reply either. Calls to the support centre are pretty fruitless with promises to ""escalate to HQ for an outcome but sorry there is not ETA"".

In this interim period I've refreshed my Apple iPad 2 which I have had for MANY years and it still charges and works well. I also recall handing in a ipod to Apple Support and it being repaired comparatively promptly."
B00DVFLJKQ,19,188,Great product no thanks to Amazon,lil' old me,4,Yes,25-Jul-14,1,0,"I have both a first Gen Nexus 7 and a first gen Nexus. I rated it 4 stars rather than 5 for a few downfalls. First, no external memory yet - grrr! Second, while the new black back is sleek and nice, the textured back of the first gen was more slip resistant. The speakers are on the bank so... And you will definitely want a screen protector to prevent scratcheson that gorgeous screen! Also, mine was sent to me by Amazon with chips on one of the sides. MAJORLY UPSETTING
HOWEVER - the processor is super quick! The size and sleek appearance is fabulous. The sound is AMAZING. The graphics (with a MUCH better ppi than any Mac/iPad products) are stunning. Very user friendly and the camera is nicer now that there is actually a rear facing camera as well. I love that Google syncs across all my devices! Love getting Android OS updates first. All in all, I love the product!"
B00DVFLJKQ,19,189,One of the best purchases I've ever made.,matt,5,Yes,12-Nov-14,-,0,"I did plenty of research before purchasing my first tablet and after all the reviews and pros and cons of each tablet I went with the 2nd gen nexus 7. Its performance specs and price made it a very easy choice. Pros: Battery life, display, android operating system, availability of accessories, system specs, size, weight, and best of all PRICE. This things a beast and easily outshines all other tablets in this price range as well as other more expensive tablets and has the feel of a much more expensive item. It doesn't feel cheap, the screen is very responsive, and the overall experience when using it is great. Its main drawback is that theres no SD card slot so you only get the internal memory (16 or 32). Other than that I'm more than happy with my purchase and definitely feel like I got MORE than what I paid for."
B00DVFLJKQ,19,190,First one had a defective touch screen,Matthew Simmers,4,Yes,11-Mar-14,-,0,"The first one i purchased from amazon had a touchscreen that would flake out ocassionally requiring a reboot. The warranty terms with ASUS are terrible, requiring at least two product returns for the same issue before they would even consider a replacement of the defective item. Fortunately Amazon to the rescue as they refunded the item even though it was slightly out of the refund window and then i purchased again when the item came back in stock. Knock on wood the replacement seems to work as expected. 4 Starts for the product. 1 Star for the Asus warranty. 5 Stars for Amazon customer service."
B00DVFLJKQ,20,191,Great for flights.,Avid Fan,5,Yes,21-Jan-14,1,0,"Didn't initially want a 7"" tablet, but, decided to give this form factor a try. Already had a Xoom and an iPad 4. This is so much more convient for travel, especially on planes. I find it to be just big enough to watch movies or read books on and easy to stow and get out. I can easily slide it into the pocket of my sweatpants. Also a big fan of Android and wanted to try the Nexus line with its promise of timely updates. No complaints or regrets as Android developers improve the number and quality of tablet apps."
B00DVFLJKQ,20,192,i forgot to put a review for a long time - review,kelvin viola,5,Yes,19-Dec-13,1,0,"just like a lot of people who purchased this item I previously owned the 2012 model but the difference between me and some of the other people was i was completely happy with the performance of my 2012 nexus 7. now on to the review.

most of the time I use my tablet for consuming media, and most notably when youtube updated their app it was easier to go from one video to another without loosing whatever it is you were watching. I use it to check my mail and just about anything i could do with it.

it is worth saying that I havent updated to the latest version of android (4.4 kitkat) at the moment i am making the review. im running 4.3 because i was kinda lazy to flash a new recovery. but having said that it kinda didnt matter since most of the things that i liked about kitkat was exclusive to nexus 5.

Speed + Multitasking
dont let that old processor fool you, I couldnt intentionally make it slow. i had 3 games running (well 1 on the screen and 2 others hidden) and it was just for experiment I switched from one game to another and it handled it like a BOSS. to name the three games its real racing 3, Deer Hunter and D-Day. so as you would imagine if it could handle that 1 video on mobo floating around while you browse the web and/or check mail would be a walk in the park.

Hardware
screen is still nice i didnt change the kernel. the buttons are still there and i always click the volume buttons because well i like clicking them a lot, i couldnt say the same to the lock button because i have a magnetic cover that shuts the screen off and turns it on when its covered and opened respectively but the button works. in everyday use i didnt feel like it was too hot to handle or overheating even when its hot inside the train. the screen is really bright probably too bright if theres no light on. if theres reflection i could still see the contents of the screen.

Speakers
i know that a lot of people were saying good things about the boom sound and front facing speakers but these speakers on this thing is pretty good as well. its not too loud that when youre out and about and you wanted to show something to your friends and theres vehicles passing by its hard to hear from the speakers. if its indoors theres no problem with it."
B00DVFLJKQ,20,193,Samsung Nexus 7 by Asus,Barbara P. Saunders,4,Yes,25-Aug-14,1,0,"I love my Nexus 7! It was a difficult choice with everyone in my family using IPads/phones/Apple everything, but I wanted to try this. Don't worry...my techie son recommended this series, as well as my S4 phone. I like the size...just right for a small handbag. Syncs quickly with phone. Many apps in Play Store and many more to come. Works well with bluetooth keyboard and Google voice. Great viewing on the video scene and camera takes great pictures. I'm enjoying my Nexus 7 and would recommended highly."
B00DVFLJKQ,20,194,Touch screen desensitizes at times...,Amazon Customer,4,Yes,03-Feb-15,1,0,"It's fast and pretty and all that.

The only problem I have is that the screen isn't as sensitive as the last version of the Nexus 7 tablet. It sometimes just doesn't want to work until you've turned it off and back on... I don't know why it does that. And I don't mean a full reboot, but sleep/wake. It's just ... annoying when it loses sensitivity so much that you briefly wonder if you've picked up something that needs a mouse..."
B00DVFLJKQ,20,195,"Rebbots, reboots",Amazon Customer,3,Yes,25-May-15,2,0,"At first, it looked like an improvement over the previous model that had just morphed into a brick: nicer, faster, better camera, so I was happy. After about 2 weeks, it started to reboot for no apparent reason. It was at Lollipop 5.1, it would sometimes work for several hours, then would start rebooting every few minutes. Then it ""upgraded"" to 5.1.1, I figured that my troubles were over, they must have fixed the problem, but NO, since then it reboots right away, only a few minutes between reboots!"
B00DVFLJKQ,20,196,"Very good, but some issues.",Mike,4,Yes,01-Mar-15,-,0,"Good form-factor, nice display. Overall good tablet. However, it isn't perfect. Often laggy, even after reformatting and cleaning. Amazon lags like crazy, my email lags, and all but the simplest web pages will lag.
And, after 11 months, the touch screen is failing. Luckily, it's still within warranty, so I'm hoping they fix it.
We'll see.
If you can't make up your mind between a generic $99 tablet and a top-of-the-line $4-500 one, this might be a good option."
B00DVFLJKQ,20,197,Bought in Used-Good Condition,Z. Smith,5,Yes,20-May-14,-,0,"I purchased this tablet in Used-Good condition. It had a little nick (barely noticeable) at the top of the tablet (a pretty cover can rectify that problem). If it wasn't for the nick, it probably would have been described as excellent condition. I got a really good deal on it for such a minor imperfection. It came neatly wrapped in clear, plastic packaging paper like it was brand new. I bought this one to replace my Nexus 7 (older version). The delivery was fast and it was neatly packaged and came with the manuals and charger. Thank you Amazon!"
B00DVFLJKQ,20,198,Could not be happier with my new Nexus7!,L. H.,5,Yes,29-Nov-13,8,0,"So awesome! It does everything I want it to do from e-mail and document processing to free games for my cat, with very few frustrations. So much that I wanted to use it for was already installed. If you are a heavy user of Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, etc., then this is the tablet you want. The screen is a tactile and visual pleasure. (Not a scratch after weeks of carrying it in my purse without a case too.) It upgraded painlessly and effortlessly to Android Kit Kat as soon as it was available. One of the best features is that it doesn't have all the junk software added on top of the operating system that other tablets have. It functions at decent speeds even with a weak WiFi signal. I've dropped it once on concrete flooring (in a case) and it suffered no damage. At first I thought the camera wasn't so great, then I figured out how to adjust for the lighting (incandescent/fluorescent/daylight) and now I'm taking amazing pictures. Uploading them to Facebook or Google Drive is a piece of cake. I'm old, so operating a tablet wasn't intuitive for me, but after a month I had the hang of it and I absolutely love my Nexus 7."
B00DVFLJKQ,20,199,Exceeded my expectations!,Cali_Nesto,5,Yes,13-Dec-14,-,0,Had an iPad 2 but didn't like the large screen and limitations of iOS. Bought a Samsung Galaxy tab 2 which was OK but was rendered practically unusable after a system update (slow slow slow). Almost shelled out way too much money for an iPad mini but thought I'd give this a try. Boy am I glad I did! This tablet is FAST FAST FAST! I've no problems at all with it and saved a ton of money (compared to an iPad mini). My only recommendation is to make sure you get the 32 gig version as there is no slot to add extra storage.
B00DVFLJKQ,20,200,You can easily notice the difference,Luciano T.,4,Yes,26-Aug-15,-,0,"Upgraded from a Nexus 7 older model. You can easily notice the difference: The screen is great, the stero speakers and the rear camera additions are really appreciated and overall it feels fast and responsive, unlike my older Nexus 7 (specially after upgrading to Android L). I guess the only thing I'm not thrilled about is the responsiveness of the screen, I have the feeling that my older tablet reacted to a lighter touch compared to this one. Overall I'm quite happy with my purchase."
B00DVFLJKQ,21,201,Awesome Little Tablet!,Dawn K.,5,Yes,25-Nov-15,-,0,"I bought this tablet for my daughter's 11th birthday. She has been using it for about a week now and has yet to stop thanking me for the ""best gift ever"". The tablet was a breeze to setup and has more features and functionality than she has had time to explore to date. I'm very impressed with the screen quality and the speed with which this little table operates. It is an amazing tablet especially for this price range."
B00DVFLJKQ,21,202,Great Tablet,Adrianne,5,Yes,13-May-15,2,0,"I have been wanting one of these for a long time. I bought this on December 12, 2014, so I've had it for about five months. It works perfectly for my needs, but I have not installed Lollipop as I have read too many reports of problems with the upgrade. KitKat is fine for me in this tablet which I bought for an EXCELLENT price and does what I want it to do.."
B00DVFLJKQ,21,203,Great buy,STEVIE,4,Yes,25-Jul-14,1,0,I originally purchased the 1st Nexus 7 and had no issues whatsoever. I gave away my Nexus 7 as a gift and purchased the Kindle 8 Fire HDX cause it's a little bigger in screen size. I was disappointed in the way it was restricted from adding apps from the google playstore and/or being able to customize it to your taste. I returned the Kindle 8 and purchased the newer Nexus 7 (2013). I am content with this tablet in every way except that you can't add storage.
B00DVFLJKQ,21,204,... of choices and I chose this unit because I like Google Chrome browser,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,23-Apr-15,-,0,"Tons of choices and I chose this unit because I like Google Chrome browser. I like it best because my bookmarks sync between this tablet and my desktop and cell phone.?

Some things, like Kleenex,do not need competition. Google and its products are like that for me.

This little tablet let's me surf as if I were in my desktop or am surfing from my desktop. And since it is a WIFI only unit purchased directly from the manufacturer, I get updates promptlynand am not loaded down with cell phone company ... well I do not have, nor have I ever felt the need to route this unit.

I am totally satisfied with this tablet."
B00DVFLJKQ,21,205,"Great Tablet so far, just wish all Bluetooth devices worked with it.",Donovan Kennedy,5,Yes,27-Mar-14,-,0,"Not much to say, Great tablet, but at this price range, their will be issues/compromises. Currently the only thing I'm having issues with is the Bluetooth compatibility. I have MoKo Google New Nexus 7 FHD 2nd Gen Case - Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Cover Case .... and it works perfect! I have a Bluetooth mouse, and the exact opposite, sometimes it shows on my devices sometimes it doesn't, only worked once. The tablet itself works smoothly, runs everything I have asked of it, just wish android had fixed Bluetooth compatibility for all devices."
B00DVFLJKQ,21,206,Perfect.,marco,5,Yes,15-Feb-15,-,0,Blazing fast updates from Google. Just got Android 6.0 today and this think is over 2 yrs old. Pure Android. Plenty of storage. My son loves this tablet. So do I! It can even fit in my back pocket. This is our 2nd purchase of this tablet because my son broke the first one we bought in 2014. We got the SquareTrade warranty then and was able to replace the tablet for even less on Amazon! Of course we bought another SquareTrade warranty. If I had extra cash I'd buy another one for a backup.
B00DVFLJKQ,21,207,Nexus 7 2013 is a good tablet,Glenn E. Mitchell,5,Yes,20-Dec-14,1,0,"My 2012 Nexus bricked during an over the air update. I swallowed hard and bought this tablet. It is a convenient size to hold. Lasts a day or more on a charge. Can be charged wirelessly. The back has a nice feel. The front suffers from fingerprints, as do they all. In use, the tablet is largely trouble free. I am of the opinion that a tablet is almost a necessity in the modern world. The Nexus 7 is a serviceable tablet that is well supported by Google."
B00DVFLJKQ,21,208,Excellent tablet,Richmond Low,4,Yes,23-Dec-13,2,0,"I have an iPad Air as well and I find I use my Nexus 7 a lot more.

It fits into my pants pocket and it is comfortable to hold in one hand.

The main disadvantage I find vs the iPad Air is the lack of accessories. Apps also don't quite work as well as on the iPad. You have almost too many choices on Android and the apps tend to be not as polished. The big, popular apps are not at issue. If you mostly use apps like Facebook, Twitter, Google apps, etc. you have nothing to worry about.

I use my Nexus 7 mostly to read, and to watch streaming video every so often. For those purposes, the Nexus 7 can't be beat. The screen is great and it is a joy to read on the Nexus 7.

I tried playing a few games as well and I have no complaints. The games ran smoothly. I can't get used to playing games using touchscreen controls though so I don't really play anything besides Angry Birds, Solitaire, Bejeweled Blitz and a couple of driving games.

I would have given it 5 stars except for the lack of accessories and it can be a bit tough to navigate through the app store. I was thinking maybe I should give it 5 stars since this is not really the fault of the device itself - it's a great device but I do think the ecosystem matters as well."
B00DVFLJKQ,21,209,Great Tablet and Really Portable!,William Kraski,5,Yes,19-Jan-15,-,0,"To my way of thinking, the Nexus 7 2013 is one of the best Android tablets, ever! The 7"" size makes it really portable. Much more so than the larger devices. Yet, the screen size is large enough for videos and movies. And the newer model eliminated any issues with the 2012 version. I also knew this was going to be upgraded to Android 5.0. After charging it a bit, I turned the tablet on. And I was pleasantly surprised to see it upgrade, in stages, before I even set it up."

I'm not going into much detail here but I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for any tablet - great bang for the buck. I was an iOS user until I got this and now I realize how useful and versatile Android is. Sometimes the device lags up on me but I'm still figuring out whether that's a particular app I have or not.

B00DVFLJKQ,22,211,Good Quality Product,Adam Helewski,4,Yes,27-Aug-13,-,1,"This is my first tablet, and I'm happy with the purchase. I wanted something that was between the size of my iPhone and laptop that I could use to open websites and play games.

Battery life has been good so far. With my fairly heavy usage, it can go for at least two days before needing a charge. The display is nice, and performance is generally very responsive. Sometimes the back of the tablet gets a little warm, but not uncomfortably so.

My only real complaint is that the Chrome browser that comes with is set to retrieve mobile sites by default. As a decent size tablet, most times I'm more interested in seeing the full desktop version of sites I try to open on this tablet. I've looked up solutions to that, and it sounds a bit difficult to change. But other browsers can be downloaded that can be set to pull the desktop version of a site by default."
B00DVFLJKQ,22,212,"Fast, portable, responsive, easy to use",Pol,5,Yes,07-Apr-14,2,0,"Bought this just for web browsing and its great. Fits in my handbag with ease, very clear screen, very responsive, extremely easy to use. I've had no issues with it so far, except for it doesnt have a very good battery life. But Im not sure how it compares to other tablets of this size for that to be a bad thing. I've played some little games on this and its great. Gets a bit hot but I dont feel it through the cover at all."
B00DVFLJKQ,22,213,Perfect for my needs,P. Trimble,5,Yes,01-Sep-14,1,0,"I won't go into all of the details that other reviews have put up since they have done it better than I could, just wanted to add my quick thoughts. This is the perfect tablet for me. Screen is great, size is perfect, no quality issues, great battery life...just everything I was hoping for when I bought a tablet. I use it every single day on my commute and can't imagine life without it. If you are a typical user looking for a great tablet for everyday use then this is what you want."
B00DVFLJKQ,22,214,Great tablet,Wpgkayak,4,Yes,25-Feb-14,1,0,"The tablet works great. I was very disappointed with the game selection though on google play.
I like card games, dominoes, sudoku, etc., but the games on google play are terrible. They are poorly designed, not easy to follow the card play, most of them miss the finer points of actually playing a card game. Domino games were just as bad, so were the sudoku games.

The whole point of buying this tablet was to have a small portable device I could pop into my purse. One that I could enjoy a game on while I take the bus to and from work - an hour long ride. I would have been better off buying a bigger purse and carrying my iPad."
B00DVFLJKQ,22,215,I am very happy with my purchase,Nixon Percutio,5,Yes,04-Feb-14,-,0,"This is a great and easily modifiable tablet, it is very fast and a great value for its size and quality vs other tablets. It doesn't have a back LED and you still have to install Google services framework onto whatever aosp based rom you are using to get anything practical done. But I'm not the master programmer that can fix that glaring privacy/security issue (using google for anything) so for what its worth I really like this tablet. Just cover the camera and mic holes at all times and leave it in a thick lead box when you aren't using it."
B00DVFLJKQ,22,216,Wife wanted a E-Reader for Xmas,Cal Iaccarino,5,Yes,29-Apr-14,7,0,"Wife wanted an E-Reader but after taking some good advice from some friends I came to the obvious realization that the the Nexus 7 gave here an E-Reader with a whole heap more. Wife happy therefore husband happy. My wife has used it indoors, outdoors, camping, in hotels and on flights and tells me shes really happy with it. The fact that she can also get all her email and browse the web was a bonus she wasn't expecting."
B00DVFLJKQ,22,217,My least favorite Nexus,TechChris,3,Yes,29-May-14,-,2,"I've owned a Nexus 4, two Nexus 10s (first was stolen) and the 2013 model of the Nexus 7. I won't go into the similarities between them. The all run Android/Cyanogenmod well and I still haven't scratched any of them, despite taking no special precautions (a bumper on the Nexus 4 is all). But this Nexus 7 drives me crazy because of the poor battery life. I run the same software on all my devices (with the exception of the 4, which runs far more), and I'm lucky if I can get two days out of this with minimal use (mostly web surfing less than 2 hours a day). Once it gets past the 50% mark, it's pretty much going to be dead by the time I pick it up again. By comparison, I can get a 1-2 weeks out of my Nexus 10, using it the same way (and I usually use that for youtube as well).

If you want something in the 7-inch form, I'd look into another brand. If you don't mind going bigger, and you can still find it, the Nexus 10 is the finest tablet I ever put my hands one (I have no idea why they discontinued it). It takes forever to charge, so it might not be good for heavy gamers (which can kill the battery in hours), but it's the best tablet for surfing and youtube. Lighter than the iPad."
B00DVFLJKQ,22,218,Great tablet,mr isuzu,4,Yes,26-Sep-14,-,0,"I can't say much bad about this tablet. I've had other products from the Nexus line and this one has held up just as well. It's always up-to-date with the most up-to-date android release, and it's not full of bloatware and random software phone and tablet manufactures like to pre-load. It's got a fast enough processor to where I never had an issue of it freezing, and it's battery lasts a very long time. If you want a smaller tablet go for it. I'm taking one star off because it doesn't fit in my hand that well, but for you you might have a different experience"
B00DVFLJKQ,22,219,Auto Rotate Issues,YC,3,Yes,21-May-15,1,0,"Great tablet, the built in GPS is fantastic. However after having for a year and always in a well padded case the auto rotate has been sketchy at best, anyone who knows me knows that I am very careful with my stuff and take care of it. I do still use my tablet frequently and see this as a quality problem. That being said it has done well otherwise. If they could fix the auto rotate it would be 5 stars for me."
B00DVFLJKQ,22,220,BEST BUY EVER,Craig Nicholas,5,Yes,02-Mar-14,-,0,"After looking in the tablet market for a couple weeks and looking through countless reviews I passed over the nexus 7 because of its humble price range and small size. No way could this $270 (32gb) tablet be a contender against galaxy tabs or I pads (not really a fan of apple) that were $400+! Then I saw some specs and reviews on various sites that blew my mind! Crazy fast processor, crystal clear screen, and stock android all packed into a 7 inch screen including front and back cameras! What more could you want? With Amazon's low price I was able to pick one up for around $250, which was possibly the best $250 I've ever spent. All good things about this tablet from the customisation to the blazing fast speeds to the vibrant display, Google sure has done it again with this 2013 model! Only complaint I could possibly have is no expandable memory in the form of an sd card slot but hey, the thing's $250 go get one, you won't be disappointed!"
B00DVFLJKQ,23,221,Disappointing sound quality and reliability,Shalom Yariv,2,Yes,10-Jan-16,1,1,"What I like:
- Decent display
- High performance
- Fine GPS

What I don't like so much:
- Sound quality is pretty poor
- Internal loudspeaker is very week
- No memory expansion

What I hate:
- Unreliable: Power & sync socket breaks and it is very hard to replace or find someone who can do it.

In summary:
I won't buy this again"
B00DVFLJKQ,23,222,Don't bother! Headache.,len b.,1,Yes,26-Jan-16,-,1,"My son saved his money for months to purchase this tablet. It worked well, he took very good care of it and applied any updates that came up. He has had it for 7 months and for the last 2 months it has been freezing up several times a day. Directions and problem solving online show that this is a very common problem and people just seem to accept it?
It is now next to useless. He needs it for school, homework and reading.
Very disappointed with the tablet and service from the company we purchased it from.
Should have bought an Ipad."
B00DVFLJKQ,23,223,A great little tablet,Jerry E. Shelton,5,Yes,10-Mar-14,-,0,"This is my first tablet and it has been working perfectly since I received it. It's FAST and fun to use and I LOVE IT for reading ebooks, and watching videos, as the text and display is so sharp and clear. It seems to work very well pulling in wifi signals when traveling. The 32 gigabytes of memory seems so far, to be plenty, even after loading the tablet with music, photos, videos and podcasts. VERY sharp display, and with earbud headphones, I have plenty of volume and great sound. All of my desktop computers of the last few years have had Asus motherboards (A+ certified computer tech here), which I've had great luck with, and one of the reasons why I chose this tablet. Highly recommended!

The only trouble I've had is when I first turned the tablet on, I didn't realize you have to have WIFI for the tablet to finish setting up. Once I had my wifi turned back on, the tablet set itself up and no further problems."
B00DVFLJKQ,23,224,First Tablet,John Shepard,5,Yes,22-Dec-13,1,0,this was my first tablet I mainly use it to replace my textbooks that I know have in PDFs and on my Nexus so instead of carrying 10-15 lbs in just textbooks I have my tablet that weighs less than 1 lb with the case and as a College student that is load off my back and it works really smoothly with other apps and a the few games I have on it and the battery lasts a long time I don't do anything that really kills the battery maybe just a little web browsing and mainly to read PDFs and it lasts me all day
B00DVFLJKQ,23,225,Buying 32gb Nexus 7 tablet for some extra money is really a worth of each penny :),Chandra Kant Sao,5,Yes,23-Jul-14,-,0,"Decision to buy 32 gb variant by paying some extra money was really a worth of each penny as I can enjoy more games and HD content on device. :)

Looks and feel :-
by just holding on hand for second after taking it out of the box you can tell it's next-generation stuff. It's slimmer and lighter, measuring just 8.7mm thin and weighing 290g.

Its lot more easier to hold in one hand.than its ancestor and contemporary.Excellent build quality has been maintained.

Body behind brain aka Hardware and Connectivity :
Main highlight of the Nexus 7 is its amazing screen i.e 7in IPS display's resolution 1920x1200 with pixel density of 323ppi. Display is simply stunning.

For 2013 Nexus 7 Google said bye bye to nVidia and welcome to Qualcomm on-board with 1.5 GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro quad-core Krait processor and what more :) ram memory has been doubled to 2 GB. Which will be super for game player. This tablet is equipped with Dual-band 802.11n Wi-Fi (although not 11.ac), Bluetooth 4.0 LE (low energy), GPS, NFC and Qi wireless charging

Although back Camera is not great with 5 mp but quality is sufficient enough to capture moment and Front camera with 1.2 one can do nice video call using Skype or Google hangout

Brain aka Software (Android 4.4 KitKat)
One of the great advantages of being a Google-branded device you get software upgrade free and on time. Most of the updates are done for making Android easier to use. One good feature is 'restricted profiles' having multiple user accounts on one device. With restricted profiles user can manage apps and content . This is great feature as you can restrict certain things for children to use the Nexus 7 which aviode accidentally spending money or accessing unsuitable content.

User get all of Google's apps pre-loaded including the Play store.

Performance and battery
The quad-core processor + latest version of Android which makes Nexus 7 feels amazing and responsive. It even boots up quicker in just over 30 seconds.

Battery life is increase drastically by 15~% even by using a smaller battery from its predecessor . It measn new google nexus 7 can last upto 9 hours with single charge. which include watching HD video

Con's
No SD card slot
No IR support means Nexus 7 can't be use as TV remote control unlike other tablets
User need to buy a separate Qi-compatible wireless charger

Verdict 5/5
Yup there are few cons but still its best product to buy under this budget with this quality and battery life and for cons ther is workaround like user use micri usb charging port and enjoy extend storage or access to outside world content like HD video etc; by using flash drive pen drive"
B00DVFLJKQ,23,226,Great Product and Value,Frank,5,Yes,08-Jul-14,-,0,"Very happy with this tablet. I got it as a gift for my mother (73) who was using the computer less and less. After loading a game or two to entice her, she began using the tablet every day. She checks her email and connects with the grand kids on FB again. The tablet is lightweight, which is important for her, and lasts a day with normal usage. I did quite a bit of research before purchase and no other tablet offered the same value. It isn't the biggest or the most advanced, but anything quantifiably better is double the price."
B00DVFLJKQ,23,227,Just great bang for the money even in 2014-15,RJW,5,Yes,12-Dec-14,-,0,"Purchased for my Son Christmas 2013, new generation. Just great bang for the money even in 2014-15. I had researched extensively. I wanted a quad core unit. The unit I purchased was 32G, Wifi model only. He uses in the home mostly. In my opinion its a better deal than some apple products at 2-3 times the price. I love apple products but not paying that kind of money for a child. He has a Google ""Samsung"" Laptop for school work at home, the Nexus7 is used for fun and educations he is now learning basic coding on it. Solid product under $230.00"
B00DVFLJKQ,23,228,"Okay, but got a wonky one",ezyduzit,3,Yes,20-Apr-14,2,1,"The 7 is a very decent tablet, I think mine was just bad from factory cos I kept having freeze issues and the camera was subpar. I returned and didn't another though because I don't really need a tablet I simply wanted one and me getting a problem item was the universe telling me so, lol at least that's how it seems to me. When the time comes that I do need a tablet I will more than likely go with google though."
B00DVFLJKQ,23,229,Nexus 7 holds its own against the IPad Mini 2,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,01-Dec-13,6,0,"I've had the Nexus 7 for about 3 weeks and have yet to explore a tenth of what it can do. So far I haven't hit any unworkable glitches at all except in various apps, such as the Kindle app, where enlargement of illustrations has been a pain (but I think that's Kindle's fault).

The tablet has great screen resolution. Great size--fits in a deep jacket pockets, even with a case.

One thing I especially like is that with the USB connection you can drag and drop files between the Nexus and your regular computer--if you can find them. The AntTek Explorer Ap is helping with that. Sometimes the Google Apps gobble everything up and you don't know where things are.

I do have one other complaint and that is the documentation, which is practically non-existent. In the box you get zero. You have to go online for the booklet, and that is minimal. For anything else you have to consult the user forums. If I had ONLY the tablet, that would be tough. Several times I've had to sit at my regular computer and look at forums while I have my tablet in hand. Much of what I've figured out has been by stumbling around. I suppose that is now the way of things, but I'm one who has always actually consulted the direction booklets.

It would be nice to know, for instance, how thoroughly one should turn the tablet off and when. You can put it to sleep with a button tap or letting it go off, or you can shut it down by holding the button in for several seconds and then choosing your shut-down mode. I could probably find this out from the forums, but, gee, wouldn't it be elementary to TELL us this?

Or take the built-in clock. I can't tell you how frustrating it was to try to turn off the alarm clock without waking everyone else in the house. I even consulted the forums. Finally I stumbled onto what I suppose the makers thought was obvious-a sideways swipe of a finger.

All in all, though, this tablet is a wonderful value. For me it came down to a choice between the Nexus 7 and the new IPad mini 2. The file transfer and size proportions tipped the balance for me, and the price confirmed my choice."
B00DVFLJKQ,23,230,Love this tablet!,S&W,5,Yes,03-Sep-13,-,0,"Not much to say except that for a 7"" Android tablet the Nexus 7 is, in my opinion, the best of the best. There are plenty of reviews and detailed specs available covering this device for those who are interested. All I will add is that for my purposes, having previously owned a Samsung Galaxy Tab II 7"" tablet which I thought was quite good, the Google Nexus 7 is heads and shoulders better in every way, especially when it comes its high resolution display and the latest version of Android that it's running. What a powerhouse of a hand held machine! Amazing!!"
B00DVFLJKQ,24,231,"Beast of a tablet - best 7"" out there",Mister B,5,Yes,20-Dec-13,1,0,"Other 7"" tablets are cheaper, but they're not nearly as nice. This has a full 1920x1200 HD display and it's super bright and crisp. 32GB of storage is plenty for me - it had around 27GB free when I got it and I don't see running out any time soon. Very fast, great graphics performance, and plays any game I throw at it. Add in the fact that it will get the latest version of Android for the next 12-18 months and I don't see a reason to go with an iPad Mini Retina at nearly twice the cost"

Gave it 4 stars because every now and then the touch screen gets ""glitchy"" (wrong apps open or app I want won't open, keypad types wrong letters or gets unresponsive). Usually happens when battery is below 50% but I am not sure that has anything to do with the problem. I let it set while charging and it is fine next time I use it."

B00DVFLJKQ,24,239,Good Tablet,George,4,Yes,20-Jun-14,-,1,"I waited for the price to reduce a little then purchased primarily to run a navigation app on my boat. I picked the Nexus because it was said to have the brightest screen of the tablets. It is indeed brighter than our Samsung Tab 3.8 but still not bright enough to be used on an open cockpit boat in broad daylight. As far as my primary use for this, it is worthless. However, as far as normal tablet functions its good and I like the 7 inch size versus the 8 inch Samsung because its easier to hold, lighter and thinner also. The battery seems to last forever too."
B00DVFLJKQ,24,240,AWESOME!!!!,Paul Davis,5,Yes,27-Jun-14,-,0,"I am replacing a 32g Nexus 7 tablet which was purchased in 2012. It had to be shipped to ASUS in March 2013 and repaired and it's long out of warranty and it appears to be forever dead and gone. It's been at a shop for a month and they can't figure it out. OH WELL, on to this one. I AM DELIGHTED with the dual cameras, the original Nexus 7 only had a forward facing camera so this is a fantastic addition. I am not a computer geek and have to say I've avoided replacing my laptop because Windows 8 freaks me out so to say the Nexus 7 is user friendly is a complete understatement. I am so glad I used google and gmail because I lost nothing! My calendar repopulated which made me very happy and all my pictures are there (evidently in cyberspace somewhere but I have em!) and I lost nothing even though my old tablet crashed. The new one is lightning fast and I love it to pieces. Amazon had it here practically overnight, always a great place to do business, always check here first."

Critically, its pure Android. No bloat, no horrific UI's such as what Samsung likes to do... and you get updates nearly as fast as they are released for Android. Love it!"

I have come to prefer the Android operating system to iOS. You'll be amazed at what you get for the small price tag!"
B00DVFLJKQ,25,243,Happy with the Nexus 7,RAK,5,Yes,20-Oct-15,1,1,"My first one was ruined by the infamous update to Lollipop, then to finish it 6 months later, a drop that broke the screen. So, I ordered another, worried that the Lollipop would ruin it, too, but hoping I could renew my original experience with the Nexus 7. However, it is up-to-date, runs well and meets all my expectations.
Arrived on time, as advertised."
B00DVFLJKQ,25,244,Nexus 7 2nd Generation,Marrielle,2,Yes,30-Mar-14,-,1,"I really want to love it. However, mine was only 3 weeks old and started having Keyboard problems when it got warm. I want to love Amazon, however, when I called about the problem... I was tossed over to a Tech person who had NO IDEA WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT! You expect a Tech support person to know that the keyboard is NOT AN ATTACHMENT ! Really disgusted! He had me do a back up and then reset. I then had to have All my Apps loaded again. I lost ALL my pictures! Nothing changed... It STILL RUNS WARM & THE KEYBOARD STILL FREEZES UP OR BLACKS OUT. I'm really disappointed in Amazon and the Tech Services."
B00DVFLJKQ,25,245,Still going strong after 3 years,Buffee,5,Yes,16-Sep-16,-,0,"Still going strong. I purchased this the minute it came out. Even though my 1st generation worked perfectly, I wanted to upgrade. I gave the old one to my personal assistant. I have NO issue with this tablet. I doubt you can buy a better one. I had Samsung 7, & 8 and returned both. Someone? will have to pry this workhorse from my cold, dead hands."
B00DVFLJKQ,25,246,Lovely little tablet!,Saturnine,4,Yes,09-Jul-14,-,0,"Pros: Most everything. I also recently discovered that there is an Umbutu Linux distribution for this device. I may install that and fire-up my bluetooth keyboard and mouse to see if that runs well. I like the idea of a this device as a general purpose computer. If I do it I'll update the review and five star the beast despite the weak speakers.

Con: Sound volume max is quite low, so one cannot use it without headphones/external speakers in any place but a quiet room."
B00DVFLJKQ,25,247,Poor quality device.,TMc,1,Yes,03-Feb-15,4,1,"1 year and 10 days after purchasing this tablet it abruptly stopped charging. After some google sleuthing it became apparent this was not an uncommon complaint. I only used the product intermittently (maybe 3-4 times a week). For the price paid, the failure of a critical component with less than 13 months of infrequent use is simply unacceptable. $250 paperweight."
B00DVFLJKQ,25,248,Poor quality control,Basil Yokarinis,2,Yes,22-Oct-14,1,0,"Excellent while it lasts. However, within a year of owning it, I have had touch screen issues (sometimes fine, sometimes non responsive and sometimes ghost touches) TWICE. The first time was fixed under warranty with minimal fuss, and second time... we'll see. Nice that it was fixed quickly and easily, but it shouldn't have happened in the first place, let alone a second time! Great tablet, poor quality control."
B00DVFLJKQ,25,249,The best! It's the 3 year since we got it ...,Abualjood,5,Yes,06-Aug-17,1,0,"The best! It's the 3 year since we got it without any problem. Highly functional, easy to use, elegant design and affordable."
B00DVFLJKQ,25,250,Beware!,Amazon Customer,2,Yes,17-Sep-14,-,1,"This tablet works great, for about a year (or until the warranty expires). I bought one for my husband last September, and it is now dead, won't start, just a blank screen or Google logo. From what we've read online, this problem is not uncommon, and very little support is available from Google or ASUS to help. We've tried all the solutions we found online, and nothing... I also have a Nexus 7, and the warranty expired on September 8, and what do you know, it is starting to act up. It freezes and have to reboot, starting to have a mind of it's own when it starts program on its own, touch screen is not responsive... I just reset it, so we'll see what happens. Hope it doesn't die like my husband's. In any case, prior to this month, I was a big Nexus 7 fan. Now I would never consider purchasing an ASUS product."
B00DVFLJKQ,26,251,Fantastic Device,Danial Hallock,5,Yes,11-Nov-13,5,0,"I recently purchased a second generation, 32 GB, Nexus 7 with a leather case (and Bluetooth Keyboard), and a mUSB - HDMI adapter for a total of approximately $450; and it was one of the best purchases that I've made in the last three or four years. I used the Nexus on both of my travel days as a media streaming device (local content through MXPlayer, and streamed content through Netflix), e-reader (Kindle App), and gaming device (Air Control and World of Goo). Both travel days consisted of about twelve hours of intermittent use, about thirty minutes of charging over lunch, and about four hours of WiFi connection.

During the two days of my conference, I used my Nexus (and keyboard) as a word processing unit. The Keyboard took a little getting used to (mostly due to the absurd key requirement to type the character '), but both devices never showed any sign of distress after being used as a defacto laptop for eight hours of relatively intense note taking. After my conference, I would then retreat to my room, hook my Nexus up to the HDMI port of the TV, and watch Netflix until dinner.

At the end of the day, my phone would be at about 13% (used only for texting and light browsing over lunch) and the Nexus at about 28%. The speed isn't what I would call ""blazing fast""- but that's mostly because I am a spoiled elitist and ""blazing fast"" is basically predicting what I want, before I want it, and then doing it. Short of that, the tablet was superb in doing what it needed to do in a timely fashion.

Setting the tablet up was a breeze. It was recognized by MediaMonkey, making importing my 5GB of playlists very intuitive; the importing of the movies (16GB) was a little more time consuming; and the syncing of Google Apps and preferences was seamless. Total setup time was about six hours, to include initial charging, and only about two hours of hands-on interaction."
B00DVFLJKQ,26,252,Love it,R. J. Bennett,5,Yes,04-Apr-14,3,0,"Great device. Got is a few months ago and I've been very satisfied since. It holds power quite well, is large enough for reading. The only thing I wish I had gotten is the phone version. While it'd be rare to call on such a large device, I need to tether my cell all the time when traveling since free wireless networks aren't around everywhere."
B00DVFLJKQ,26,253,Not bad but not perfect either,TomCat,4,Yes,07-Mar-14,-,1,"The screen is simply outstanding. It's not too thick or heavy. The texture of the back is great when holding it. Takes a bit of getting used to when holding it in the portrait position due to the small gap. Horizontal it is really comfortable but then you only see half the website, and the keyboard takes up quite a chunk of space. I gave 4 stars because of the software that was bundled with it doesn't work, and it was important to me. The version supplied is Quickoffice. I replaced it with Kingsoft Office. Battery time seems to be as advertised. Could not find a cover for it. None of the online suppliers will send to SA, and there are none locally. For reading books it is fantastic. I use a number of readers and they all look awesome on this screen. Wireless seems to be working well. Would definitely recommend this device if you want something bigger than a phone but still small enough to fit in your jacket pocket. Only downside is that it does not seem to support any USB storage devices. I have not tried a hdmi connection yet. Will update when I do. I use ESfile Explorer to attach to shares on the server over wireless to get increased storage."
B00DVFLJKQ,26,254,"Started out fine,now glitches,non responsive to screen touch and locks up at times.............",Robert S. Rogers,3,Yes,24-Aug-14,-,0,"Still debating on returning this minus restocking charge.Somedays its glitch free somedays it locks up and touch doesn't work at all.Sometimes rebooting helps sometimes it doesn't.This would be a great tablet if it worked like it suppose all the time.Amazon could not replace it so a refund minus a hefty restocking fee.The first two months it worked great,fast web page load up and wi-fi reception.I hope the Nexus 8 solves these these problems that I share with a lot of other Nexus 7 owners....."
B00DVFLJKQ,26,255,Worst I've ever seen,Trebor Nosnhoj,1,Yes,19-Jul-14,3,1,"After 10 months, will not charge. Purchased 8/13 with 1 yr warranty. I've been trying to return to have fixed/credited. Impossible to get it back to ASUS. They ask for S# and Model #, but their form never accepts it. Have probably spent 6 hrs trying to get an RMA to return, contact with a cust serv rep that has no clu. Worst I've ever seen. Obviously, they are trying to avoid warranty work. Have now purchased a Samsung Tablet Pro...no comparison!"
B00DVFLJKQ,26,256,This tablet is awesome. I bought it to replace my Nexus 7 ...,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,13-Oct-15,-,0,This tablet is awesome. I bought it to replace my Nexus 7 2012 that I dropped. I was able to transfer data by turning on the NFC and touching the backs of the both tablets. I wish my music transferred the same way. Some music that I had on my 2012 will not play on this tablet. It is in the folder when I connect it to my PC but I can't find it on the tablet anywere. I have a book for dummies and need to spend more time trying to figure it out. I did find that WMA music won't play on the tablet but mp3 does. I wish the volume was able to be louder but I got a bluetooth speaker and that helps. I am glad to see the clock with the timer and stopwatch. I really like the voice for google search. I am very satisified with the tablet for my needs. I would never buy and Apple product as this tablet has everything I need without the high price.
B00DVFLJKQ,26,257,My favorite portable device. It is almost perfect.,Dimi,5,Yes,26-Nov-13,5,0,"Have had this for two months and I LOVE it. Now that airlines allow you to use tablets the entire time you are in the cabin I wanted to get away from paper books and mags. I have a large screen on my laptop and a tiny screen on my phone so I opted for the 7 inch tablet that is in between the two. For most things this was the perfect decision. The only issue is when I am sitting in an airplane seat and I prop the nexus on the tray table it is too small for me to really see recorded TV shows. This is only time I would have preferred the 10 inch screen tablets. In all other situations the small size is better. To fix the problem of TV shows, just buy the MoKo 2nd gen slim fit case. It allows you to attach the N7 to your hand without having to grasp it. Makes two hours of TV watching comfortable. The size allows this to fit into my front pants pocket (with some sticking out but securely in my pocket).

I have TiVo DVRs so I got the TiVo Desktop Plus software. It transfers shows to my laptop and then auto converts them for my tablet. If you use this select (Convert for Apple Ipad which is MP4 format). I connect my N7 to my laptop in MTP mode and use Windows explorer to transfer the TV shows to my N7. I now have HD TiVo recordings that I can watch on the airplane.

Last night my N7 said it was ready to update to Android 4.4 (KitKat). I said OK and it rebooted right away with the new OS (It must have downloaded in the background ahead of time). This is why I wanted the Nexus product. I will always get the new Android OS without any of the phone manufacturer BS.

Pros:
-Light weight
-Brilliant beautiful, clear HD screen with vibrant colors. Watching HD video is FANTASTIC. Much better than my laptop.
-Fast processor. Turn it completely around and screen will orient instantly in all four directions. Much faster than my Galaxy S3 phone or my win7 laptop
-Excellent battery life. I normally charge nightly but a couple of times when I didn't I still stayed abouve 50% battery with moderate to heavy use.
-WiFi only is not a problem. If free wifi is not available I turn on my phones hotspot. If I had gotten a tablet with 4G-LTE I would pay an extra $10 a month and the exact same data usage costs. Not worth it.
-I don't use the camera but I tested it and it took a good image
-Ideal device for consuming written and video content
-separate pull down control panel on right and notification screen on left. This is much better than my phone which combines these
-Durable and well made

Cons:
-Sound volume is TOO low. I think KitKat may have improved this slightly but this is my one big complaint. If I only use earbuds and the surroundings are very noisy it is a little hard to hear my TV shows.
-Screen is perfect size EXCEPT for watching TV on a plane with the device on the TV tray. The MoKo case solves this

If you are not sure which tablet to buy . . . then this is the one. Perfect in almost every way."
B00DVFLJKQ,26,258,Nexus 7 bricked by update for hundreds or thousands of users.,Ronald B,1,Yes,10-Apr-15,4,1,"I'm sorry to have to give this product one star right now. I've had it for two years, and have been very happy with it. It's easy to use, and paints web pages very quickly.

The problem is, it appears that with the latest operating system update, the screen freezes to a ""Google"" logo, and cannot be brought out of it. The technical term for this is ""bricking"". The OS has made the tablet totally useless, and so it serves as a paperweight ""brick"".

I emphasize this is not just a problem that a technically-inclined user can overcome by entering recovery mode. The Nexus 7 forums are filled with technical, expert users who absolutely cannot solve this problem. The only real solution so far has been to send the tablet to Asus for repair, which costs from $100 to $200. As of this point, neither ASUS nor Google have acknowledged a problem, let alone offered a solution.

The problem is general. It affects hundreds or thousands of users. Until the problem is solved, buying a Nexus 7 is a losing proposition and a likely waste of money. Frankly, I would not buy a Nexus 9 either, until Google shows that it can and will support its products.

The very latest reports on the problem can be found at this website:
https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/nexus/aHPjOTqCpXY%5B1-25%5D

I will update this review if there is anything new to add on the problem or its solution."
B00DVFLJKQ,26,259,THIS is a good deal on superior equipment.,Random Guy,5,Yes,24-May-15,2,0,"I really love this tablet. It's fast, it has lots of ram and it is one of the few items directly from Google that gets ALL the latest updates. I HAD a nexus 7 2012 that I pre-ordered...broke the screen. This tablet (Nexus 7-2013) cost less than the repair of the screen on the tablet it replaced plus had an extra camera and faster processor."
B00DVFLJKQ,26,260,Great tablet and fantastic value,J Medved,5,Yes,30-Jan-15,1,0,"Nexus 7 is by far the best deal. I have two. The performance is great and very nice not to have to wait for Android updates. I tried Nexus 9, which was nice and a little faster, but N7 is more comfortable form factor and I can get TWO N7s for the price of one comparable Nexus 9.

Since it is a Nexus, unlocking/rooting is extremely easy. I still run Stock Android 5.0.2, but rooted in order to add ad blocking and a few other utilities."
B00DVFLJKQ,27,261,Excellent,William J Birecree,5,Yes,27-Dec-13,-,0,"Lightning fast.
I admit this is my first tablet, so I have nothing to compare it to. With that in mind, I used my smartphone experience as a gauge to judge this unit. It is also been in operation for only a few days, so the evaluation could change over time.
I still need to test the GPS but my wife and I have used it extensively for Skype (camera images are excellent to my phone and home) and foreign language pages. I like how the system recognizes foreign languages and gives the option to translate. A few points.
1. As above, it is extremely fast.
2.The interface, camera and apps are very intuitive to my wife, who is a first time user.
3. We want the extra storage for extended use while traveling and viewing downloaded programming.
4. I am very comfortable with the past performance of Android devices and this has the most recent version of the operating system."
B00DVFLJKQ,27,262,Ouch! Problems to come after owning for less than a year!,hesty24,2,Yes,27-Aug-13,5,1,"Update: 7/10/2014: I wish I could say that my N7 charges quickly, it use to, but the internal charge board went bad, like many of them (look it up, you will see). It once took my N7 about 2 hours to completely charge, now it take about 8 - 10 hours to charge, and sometimes i have to power it completely off to get it to start charging. Daydream function doesn't work, charge indicator doesn't work, or any function that requires the device to be connected to external power will not work. Sent it to ASUS (under warranty) Japan, they broke the microphone, and the trim around the device, and sent it back claiming it was the charging cable. When I opened up the device, I could tell that the original taping on the inside had been messed with. They told me that in order to fix the trim that they broke, they would have to charge me $100! WTF! Additionally, the back cover now covers up the microphone to the point that it is pretty much useless (this was not broken or malfunctioning before I sent it to ASUS for the charge board repair). Anyway, after about one week of the assumed fix, the device reverted back to the original problem of charging. I am going to let ASUS USA try to fix it. If ASUS USA redeems themselves and their product, and make good on the 1 year warranty, I will definitely keep the reviews updated to inform the potential consumer of ASUS products. I am wondering if ASUS really has garbage repair facilities, or if it is just the Japanese ASUS repair center that are swindling the people or being lazy. Living in Japan for over 8 years, it can tell you that this is atypical work ethic being demonstrated by the Japanese, so it makes me really wonder about ASUS now.

For additional review information, read on; however, with the newer technology and products out there, and with respect to the common issues that the N7 has, and the lack of true ASUS warranty. I would recommend to steer clear of their devices or products at this time. Maybe if they sold it for about $ 129 it would be a great deal, but not for $269.

After receiving the tablet, I began to perform a system update per the tablets prompt. Downloading 4.3 system update was fine; however, after the tablet restarted, and began installation of the update it crashed the tablet. It will show ""Google"" for a few seconds, then shows the colorful glowing ""X"" indefinitely. I have turned the tablet on and off several times in attempt to fix the issue, but this proved ineffective. I am now returning it to TigerDirect (the vendor), and we shall see how this works out. I am going to ask for a new N7 to replace this one. I will update accordingly.

Warning!!!! Do not make purchase with TigerDirect(TD). They will not respond to your RMA requests, or any other emails sent directly to the company. I had to make a phone call in order to get them to appease my RMA request. After 20 minutes of arguing with the customer support service rep, they finally entertained my requests for a return. This was my first and last time to do business with TD. Also, once they email me my RA# they want me to pay for return shipping on a pretty much DOA item!! Sure I will do it, but they will never get my business again, and I will make sure that friends and family are aware of their practices (very poor customer service). Oh, FYI, if you are sending back a broken N7 the tablet's box fits perfectly in one of those ""if it fits it ships"" flat rate USPS box ($5-6). That is if your dealing with TD and not Amazon.

Update: 9/14/2013: Thank God Amazon started shipping these to overseas military addresses!!! Just ordered another one from Amazon (the vendor). And will do the whole 1,2, 3 times and your out, before giving up. I really want this tablet to work. I will keep you guys posted on my findings, and adjust my product rating accordingly.

Update: 9/21/2013: Awesome!!! Ok so there was just something wrong with the first tablet that I got, because the 2nd tablet that I received from Amazon does not demonstrate any of the issues I experienced with the first tablet. Here was the difference: First tablet from start up asked me in this order: Select Language (Country)>>Set up WiFi connection>>Do you have a Google Account, if so, log in (which I did). Then after all that, it forced a mandatory 4.3 Jelly Bean Update which required a restart, and the problem mentioned above ensued. The second tablet asked me in this order: Select Language (country)>> Set up WiFi Connection>> Then the mandatory system update started with the restart (all was good). After all that, the tablet asked if I had a Google account. Everything was set up, no issues, this tablet is fast fast fast!!! Battery life is outstanding, the screen images are crisp. The only complaint I have is personal, and that is just where the on/off button is located. I prefer mine to be on the top right (away from the volume rocker). Interesting to note is that Viber works, unlike the first generation N7; however, there is a workaround (found on YouTube). I noticed a big difference in sound with the additional speaker, the screen resolution (with comparison to the old N7) is not that noticeable. Now the comes the wait for the 3rd party apps to catch up with this little beast!

update November 5th 2013: I have noticed that the glass used on the Nexus 7 is not Gorilla Glass, but is a far inferior glass that scratches very easy, I highly recommend with a new N7 purchase to get screen protectors as well. additionally the magnetic on an off switch does not properly function with a magnetic case cover. Because of these two flaws I am downgrading my review from a five star to a four star. Hopefully Android 4.4 will mitigate the on/off problem.

Update: Android OS 4.4 Kitkatt fixed the on/off issue with the magnetic cover, kicking the star rating to 5."
B00DVFLJKQ,27,263,An Amazing Tablet,Jared Pryor,4,Yes,01-Mar-14,-,0,"This tablet is leaps and bounds better than my older tablet and my Samsung GS3 phone too.

Pros:
I had an Asus Transformer tablet, the original model and it was long past time to upgrade, not because it wasn't working but it was slow and wasn't supported anymore. This tablet is beautiful, the screen is clear and crisp and it is lightning fast, I've yet to see it slow down or even hiccup while multi-tasking.

Cons:
The tablet had clearly been opened before I received it, even though it was marked new and the packaging even marked it as new. There was dust under the ""sealed"" wrapper and the tape had been broken from around the box."
B00DVFLJKQ,27,264,Nexus 7,L'Doleur Exquise,3,Yes,19-Feb-15,-,0,I really got this mostly to stream with my Google Chromecast. It's really responsive and the video screen is pretty clear and bright. There is a bit of delay with streaming but that could be my wi-fi connection (Thanks TIme-Warner). Compared to my Kindle Fire HDX there isn't much difference except that I can get Google play and other apps through the Google App store and it streams to my TV much better than the Kindle.
B00DVFLJKQ,27,265,Don't Mess with My Nexus,Onyasix,5,Yes,17-Jan-15,-,0,"This is my first tablet so I don't have anything to compare it to. That being said, I love it. This size is a go compromise. I bought mainly to be a FPV WiFi link with my Phantom Drone. At the time it had one of the brightest screens on the market and that play a big roll in my purchase. I love the convince of the tablet so I don't have to get every hour to check my emails, Facebook, etc. I am now in the world of the android apps and loving it."
B00DVFLJKQ,27,266,is fast and so easy to navigate,Heavncentt,5,Yes,13-May-16,-,0,"We actually ended up buying THREE of these. We bought one for our young son and were so impressed with it, that we bought one for myself and my husband. It has withstood dropping and daily use by a toddler (in a kid protective case, of course). It works flawlessly, is fast and so easy to navigate. Very nice looking tablet as well."
B00DVFLJKQ,27,267,"The battery life isnt so good, its about 2-3 hours while playing a game ...",Adrian,3,Yes,18-Dec-15,2,0,"The tablet is small and sleek and has your most basic functions. The not so basic features include wireless charging. The battery life isnt so good, its about 2-3 hours while playing a game or watching a movie. Ive had this for about 2 years."
B00DVFLJKQ,27,268,First reaction: THAT SCREEN OH MY GOD !,John,5,Yes,04-Jan-14,-,0,Great fast tablet! Love the Second Generation of the Nexus 7. Fast and silk smooth ! Does everything you need it too do. The App quantity is perfect. I love this for Netflix because that screen is gorgeous. I have never seen such a better screen on a tablet. GREAT BARGAIN. GREAT PRICE. One of the best purchases I made in 2013. The only thing bad is the Camera which is just like a regular camera on a old Smart-phone but it takes pictures and doesn't matter too much too me. Super fast and great for movies. A must buy in my eyes!
B00DVFLJKQ,27,269,"Good, but glitchy.",Amazon Customer,4,Yes,05-Nov-14,1,0,"This nexus 7 has been very functional and worked well for my needs. I want to state, however, that the production model that I received has two frustrations. The first is that the screen flickers, which is very annoying. the second is that the touch-screen has sensitivity problems. It often won't register touches, or it registers touches em incorrectly, ""clicking"" the wrong part of the screen, or doing unintended swipes or re-sizing. It may have been covered under warranty, but when I tried to register my device, I got an error saying the serial number is invalid."
B00DVFLJKQ,27,270,Nexus vs iPad Mini,JJ,5,Yes,08-Jun-14,4,0,"I just had to buy both of these tablets for a new job and was happy to finally have the chance to test both, head to head. There are an exhaustive number of great reviews on both already so I'll keep it brief.

The iPad mini simply doesn't compare. This Nexus has far better hardware. It runs faster than iPad mini, by far and the internet loads far more quickly. AppStore loads way slower than Google Play on Nexus and downloads are much faster on Nexus even though both are on the same network.

Cosmetically, I prefer the wide screen format of Nexus over iPad's older screen dimension. The clarity is clearly better on Nexus too. Also, the text on iPad is minuscule to the point of being annoying. I enabled large fonts and even went into the Accessibility options and activated the largest text and bold, and still the fonts are about 6pt at best. Very inconvenient. Nexus isn't like that and I find it much easier to read. Activating the dark background on iPad did help some though. The screen just isn't as vibrant as Nexus. iPad does have a decent 3 finger tap zoom feature, but it sorely needs to be improved in this arena. Nexus also has zoom features, but I find I don't really need it, where as, with iPad, it's an absolute must.

Graphic intensive games play far better on Nexus than iPad, though I will say the overall game quality seems to be a tad better on iPad. Angry Birds is Angry Birds. It renders faster on Nexus, but iPad seems to have a more interesting selection of apps I've never seen before. But I'm new to iPad so maybe the App Store is just more of a novelty right now. I will say that I find Google Play far easier to navigate and more pleasing to the eye. And generally, App Store's free apps seem to be riddled with heavy handed advertising. You see that on some Google Play apps too, but not as aggressively as iPad.

I have always considered myself an Android guy, and in all honesty, I don't see that changing. I have an 8.9"" Fire HDX for personal use and this Nexus and my iPad for work. I'd say that iPad has done nothing to sway me over to iOS. I like it, but it just doesn't hold a match to either HDX or Nexus, as far as user experience and power. If I had to pick just one, I'd say this Nexus is the winner, due to the specs and form factor.

I got my iPad mini for a great deal at 230 brand new. But it's only 16gb and has less than half the computing power of Nexus. I paid 221 for my Nexus and it's 32gb. This Nexus just offers way more for the money than iPad, which typically can't be had new for under $270.

Having used both iPad mini and Nexus on a daily basis for work -- hands down, Nexus is the clear winner in price, function, usability and quality. Not even close. Sorry iPad."
B00DVFLJKQ,28,271,Excellent Buy - Speedy Delivery,Magic Power,5,Yes,12-Feb-14,-,0,"I ordered this product to upgrade from another tablet. Reviews online were very positive and I agree that this is an outstanding tablet. Speed, display, sound, etc. all very good. Happened to see offer on one of the major shopping channels for the first version (2012) of this tablet and they were offering it (with a case and other accessories) for $385.00. Excellent case cost $25.00. Very pleased with performance of seller. Quick response and delivery. Good communications. Highly recommend this combination."
B00DVFLJKQ,28,272,Great little tablet,David.,5,Yes,12-Oct-15,1,0,Love the nexus 7. For me its the perfect size to carry around. Its running 5.1.1 the battery life is great I have no issues at all. I cracked the screen on my 1st one and didn't hesitate to order a new one asap. I know they make them bigger now but the 7 is just right. I just take it out of my pocket when I sit down now. Thank you Google thank you nexus for a great product.
B00DVFLJKQ,28,273,"Great Tablet, got this to replace my ipad 2 ...",Andrew,5,Yes,24-Jul-14,-,0,"Great Tablet, got this to replace my ipad 2 after i graduated from my medical program from college. Its the perfect size fits easily in my scrub pocket at work even with a case on. It is noticable that i have it there and i can feel it there but its not a heavy feeling at all. Best part is working in a Pediatric facility if i have a child who is crying or sad i set it up on netflix and half an episode of Yo Gaba Gaba later i have a smiling child while i do their treatment. The screen is perfect very bright and vivid and i love the fusion of google within the system i ask a lot of random questions to google and it works perfect. Speakers on either side of the tablet are loud and have very good sound. The price is great as well @ 200 bucks you get all the features of an inch or two taller Ipad but with even more features it cant be beat. If your looking for a tablet that is worth the bang for your buck this is the way to go."
B00DVFLJKQ,28,274,It is a nice product,egn,4,Yes,12-Mar-14,-,0,"I have purchased it few months ago. So far Nexus 7 lived up to my expectation, but only one thing I don't like that it has only internal drive and I had to purchase a special cable to connect the tablet to a USB thumb drive and download a Nexus media Importer Apps to use it, in addition to that to use my micro SD card I had to purchase a separate Card reader for Android from Meenova that uses the same App. They can be used only to playing and downloading, but files can not be transferred from Nexus to the cards.
The micro SD card reader still works well, but the cable has some connection issues already so I don't use it anymore."
B00DVFLJKQ,28,275,Much better than I was expecting,Ben,5,Yes,13-Dec-13,5,0,"This was my first 7 inch tablet, I'm coming from a Note 10.1 (both old and new). I was very surprised when comparing it to my Note 10.1 2014.

The general build quality is pretty good, one of the best for an Android tablet. The soft rubber feeling is nice. Its got a suprising weight, but isnt overly heavy. Its fairly well balanced, if a bit top-heavy.

This tablets real world performance is very smooth. Stock it only benchmarks at around 5500 (Quadrant) while my Note 2014 is around 25,000. Real world performance however, its much smoother. And boy-o-boy once I unlocked/rooted/installed custom rom (cleanrom 2.6) it really screams. Doubled my benchmark score and I cant find a hint of lag/stutter anywhere.

The screen is sharper, colors were much more natural (better whites and blacks too). Holding this next to the Note 2014 the whites are so much whiter, and the screen is brighter.

I didn't think a 7 inch tablet would be able to be good for much, but again I was wrong. Reading PDFs is easy so long as they are a good 10-12 font. Highlighting is pretty easy too.

Its nice getting the latest updates from Google. 4.4.2 is a nice OS. ART cache offer a bit of a performance boost is you dont want to root and flash your tablet.

Battery life is decent. Stock its around 2 days, rooted and custom rom (plus DS battery saver+setcpu) its about 3 days.

My Note 2014 is being returned. This tiny beast is here to stay."
B00DVFLJKQ,28,276,Bad Touch,rkara,2,Yes,23-Jan-15,-,0,"Received the 32Gb model and things seemed fine. After using the tablet for awhile the touchscreen started to act weird. It would register false touches and would stop detecting strokes such as gestures. I will contact Amazon and update the review.

--UPDATE 01/25/2015--
I talked to Amazon as requested, which told me to contact Asus. I sent in my tablet and will be receiving a replacement tablet, so what that means is that I paid $250 for a re-manufactured tablet that I could have purchased somewhere else for $150. Also, I'm paying for Amazon Prime so that I can receive my packages within 2 days. Now, I received the package within two days, but who knows how long it will take to receive the re-manufactured tablet that I will be receiving from Asus. I will update later."
B00DVFLJKQ,28,277,I love this little thing,sk,5,Yes,21-Aug-16,-,0,"Still running strong today in 2016 and I bought in 2014.
Sometimes it will not respond to touch and has a habit of overheating.
Does not run the latest android version
but it is LEGIT. I love this little thing,
I can check my e-mail, sports and anime without lag.
LOVE IT"
B00DVFLJKQ,28,278,Fantastic Tablet,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,09-Mar-14,1,0,"I have had this tablet for about 4 weeks now, and love every second of it. It is very responsive with a great screen, and the pure android has spoiled me to the point that when using my phone I try to push buttons that aren't there. In our house we have iPads (not the newest one), an iPad Mini, original Kindle Fire's and a Surface. For media consumption this tablet easily blows them all away. Do keep in mind that the charging cable that comes with it is very short, I think only 3 feet."
B00DVFLJKQ,28,279,Loving it so far!,Kevin Hartantio,4,Yes,20-May-14,1,2,"As great as i expect it to be. Performance has been great, very snappy. slick android interface. vibrant colors and great looking screen.

one major issue i came across so far though: heat.

if you are running a very intensive app, like a 3d game, it heats up. Not sure if it's normal, but it gets really hot (near where the camera is). I wont be using it for games (nor should you), but it's something i noticed while i put this machine through the ringer."
B00DVFLJKQ,28,280,Simply put - this is a great tablet - Fast and light,Rocketsql,5,Yes,28-Feb-14,1,0,"I love the whole package; great screen; KitKat is simply the best, easy to use, intuitive, and the hardware is top notch. I can't find anything not meeting my expectations. All my favorite Apps run well, the multitasking is great, battery life is great, boots fast and is a completely connected to all my Google services. Also, flawlessly runs Yahoo, Outlook Mail, Drop Box, Box, Camscanner, and too many others to list here."
B00DVFLJKQ,29,281,"Quick, efficient and very cost effective",Aa Ma,5,Yes,05-Sep-15,-,0,"This is a great tablet. Cost is great, screen great, battery great and super easy to replace. Standard charging cable is awesome. Size is great, processor is quick enough for all my needs. I am using this in my car as the media center. It plays music, videos, real-time audio visualizations, connected to OBD via WiFi. Connected to my radar via Bluetooth. Its a quick, efficient tablet."
B00DVFLJKQ,29,282,No such thing as customer service with ASUS.,Mushka,2,Yes,31-Dec-14,-,0,"8 months after I got my Nexus 7 it started overheating, then the screen would go gray when in landscape mode; then it wouldn't take a charge... I tried to invoke my warranty but couldn't find my warranty card. Truthfully, I know I registered it online and then simply never thought about ""paper"" again. When I called Asus they were useless to me. I couldn't give them the numbers they wanted, so I was dead in the water. It's interesting to note that my name has to be attached to that warranty but yet was told they couldn't track it by my name.

I loved my Nexus 7 till all this happened. Now I'll avoid Nexus and Asus both."
B00DVFLJKQ,29,283,Great tablet,Robert John Pena,5,Yes,23-Dec-13,-,0,"I have owned the 2012 version and this is much better. It is noticeably thinner and is even more portable which is very nice. I carry my phone and this tablet with me everywhere and I don't feel like I am lugging it around. The camera was a nice addition, but I feel that it was patched on half heartedly. There is no flash which pretty much makes it pointless. They should have just left it off, but I understand why it was added. The screen is better too compared to the 2012 version also."
B00DVFLJKQ,29,284,Nexus 7: my view,Sheng Jie,3,Yes,15-Oct-13,4,0,"I have this new Nexu 7 for a month now. Good things: the overall design and build is really good, very clear screen and very good speakers. However, some drawback.
1) Overall, the system is less stable than ipad. I have to re-boot almost once per week, or it is just freezed for one reason or the other.
2) The first week is messy. The system keeps on being freezed with only nexus logo blinking. But once I reset, I update all the software, then it is resolved, it take a while to figure it out.
3) The quality of applications variies a lot. Some have fonts or pix screezed out of shape. Comparatively, the ipad applications are much better governed.
I would stick to ipad mini if their specs is properly updated."
B00DVFLJKQ,29,285,Charging problem is real,Nana L,1,Yes,15-Jul-18,-,2,"Device was great when it worked but alas, I too find myself in battery won't charge purgatory! Bought a new charger and it worked (or so I thought) until I realised it was taking incredibly long to charge and kept turning off on a whim. It has refused to turn back on since the last shutdown. Hate to think that almost 300$ is gone to waste but it sure seems that way...what a shame"
B00DVFLJKQ,29,286,A Good Purchase,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,24-Dec-13,1,0,"I did a lot of pondering on whether-or-not to buy. It's a good product.

I had a Vizio Vtab. It was a disappointment and it cost so much more.

The only negative is - there isn't an SD card.

I had wanted to buy locally but our local stores wifi wasn't working, or the tablet was locked behind glass, or someone had entered a code that prevented anyone from trying it. Amazon has provided me good service and reviews."
B00DVFLJKQ,29,287,Great Tablet--would buy again!,CM,5,Yes,10-Apr-15,-,0,"This was my first tablet and I was paralyzed with fear that I would spend this much money and not like it. So after much research and talking with friends I purchased the Nexus 7--no regrets this is pretty close to a ""perfect"" tablet, although I would like to see an SD card reader. Great screen resolution, great battery life, lots of apps. Yes I would buy this again--in a heartbeat."
B00DVFLJKQ,29,288,if your picky don't bother.,Robert Hammond,3,Yes,01-Apr-14,-,1,Read the reviews on Google. Every unit I had had at least one or two dead pixels. Some were worse than others. The one I kept has 1 dead pixel and a bunch of micro dead pixels throughout the screen. mine also has slight light bleed in bottom left corner. U would never notice these things if u werent picky but if your the type to run screen tests on your new devices then u might not want the nexus 7. Other than that ive got over my little defects and love this thing. Just need to up the quality controll asus.... Maybe pay a normal wage to your workers? Amazon's customer service is amazing and every company should b like them.
B00DVFLJKQ,29,289,its updated to the new android operating system and its still great. I use it mostly for games and amazon ...,TheGodTyr,5,Yes,21-Mar-16,2,0,"I've had this tablet for about 3 years now, its updated to the new android operating system and its still great. I use it mostly for games and amazon books, Asus you have out done yourself."
B00DVFLJKQ,29,290,"Sleek, powerful, somewhat frivolous",B-Mo,5,Yes,24-Apr-14,1,0,"I love this thing for all it's worth. Admittedly, I feel silly owning this, plus a big phone that looks like a mini tablet and a laptop computer. This device however has a good deal of storage space, fits nicely pretty much anywhere, feels a little heavy but these things will slim down over the years. The camera is decent and so far I haven't experienced any issues with performance or usability."
B00DVFLJKQ,30,291,SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED!,Gary E. Vorhees,3,Yes,03-Feb-14,1,1,"Product worked really great, was impressed when I first purchased this in November. In January, less than 2 and half months later, it no longer will boot. ASUS said to return the tablet for them to look at and fix or replace. I'm glad they're going to stand behind it, but come-on, shouldn't it last longer than that for the amount you have to pay for it! Maybe I got the exception, so I guess I have to give them the benefit of the doubt."
B00DVFLJKQ,30,292,Very happy,Yuri Shvachko,5,Yes,19-Dec-13,2,0,"Bought it a month ago, now using nearly every day. Reading books, online chatting, e-mailing, smart GPS navigation, occasional photos - what else to desire? Screen resolution and battery capacity are impressive. Looks attractive and more functional with leather MiniSuit Keyboard Stand Case. Amazing childish sensation of possession of an old magic book in the pocket. This did not happen to me with iphone. Book size with leather covers was really smart solution. Right for me! Seems like this fashionable gadget works good for a conservative man. So far it is early to saying something about reliability. Hope this will not drive to purchasing newer versions every now and then. Would definitely recommend to others."
B00DVFLJKQ,30,293,Really not worth the upgrade from 2012 version,Judy L.,2,Yes,12-Oct-13,4,0,"I have a number of tablets including the Nexus 7 2012 version. I bought this tablet because it boasted a faster processor, better graphics, and the rear 5mp camera. Granted it does have the rear camera, but I really can't see where the graphics or the processor are better. I have been running the two systems at the same time for the last hour. Comparing them, the graphics actually seem richer on the 2012 version. Watching TV on the DirectTV app, the colors and blacks are richer on the 2012 model.

I listened to music on both, and, for me, there was no difference. Using the Kindle app to read books, I thought that reading on the 2013 version was easier - the screen was much brighter. The touch on the 2013 version is much less responsive - it sometimes takes two or three touches to get a response. I have also noticed that the this version takes a few times of pressing the power button to get it to boot. The original version boots with one press of the power button.

I listened to the same music on both, and there is no difference in sound quality that I can hear. I tried the rear camera for both photo and video. Both are really pretty good for both focus and clarity. Both were used in a room with very little light, and both were very clear with good lighting. The rear camera is definitely an asset for the tablet over the original version.

With my experience in tablets, I didn't have a problem setting up the Nexus 2, but I did think that it was less intuitive than setup for the original Nexus. For Google users, more of the Google apps were automatically set up in the right side bar. This may make setup a little more difficult for a new tablet user. The options and usability are all still there, but not quite as obvious as they were with the original Nexus. As yet, I haven't had any issues with the operating system or the performance other than the lack of touch response.

In consideration of the upgrades that were supposed to apply to this tablet from the original version, I really don't think it's worth the upgrade. For someone looking for a new tablet, this one would certainly be worth consideration. For anyone that has the original Nexus 7, I don't think it's worth the upgrade unless you really want the rear camera. Other than that, it's really not any better in any aspect. Other than the lack of touch sensitivity, I have not yet experienced any operating system issues. They may be yet to come, and I will update this review if and when they occur. Knowing what I now know, I would not recommend upgrading to this tablet if you already have the original Nexus 7.

At this time, I am seriously considering returning this tablet to Amazon, as my original Nexus 7 includes the unlocked AT&T data options, and this tablet has a discernible upgrade of only the rear camera.

UPDATE: 10/12/13
I am returning this tablet for a replacement. By the second day, it was taking multiple presses of the power button to get it to boot. As it came up, 1/2 the screen turned black for a few seconds. Touch response got worse, it would take 3-4 touches to get a response. Maybe I just got a lemon, but from what other reviewers have said, this seems to be happening a lot with this model. I was going to sell my 2012 model on Ebay, but decided to keep it until I find out if the 2013 model works.

UPDATE: 10/19/13
I returned the first Nexus 7 and received the replacement. The replacement had much fewer problem than the first, but it still took 3-6 times of pressing the power button to get it to boot. Also, as it came up 1/2 the screen turned black for a couple of seconds. I paid for a working tablet, and I wont' accept less. This one is going back for exchange and hopefully the next one will be the one.

Update: 11/27/13
I am now on the 5th unit since the original purchase. I called Google about the boot problem in starting the tablet. I was told that this is a ""known issue"". You have to hold the start button down for at lease 10 seconds to boot the tablet. They told me that this was a security measure to protect the tablet from being over charged. If this is the case, why is it a ""known issue""? The 4th tablet was returned because I suddenly got a ""light show"" when the tablet booted. I was afraid that the display was defective. Also, the touch was not accurate. When I touched an app, another app would come up. I have not yet tried the 5th tablet. Hopefully, this one will work. If not, I give up on the Nexus 7, and this one will be returned for a refund."
B00DVFLJKQ,30,294,nexus tablet,Pat,4,Yes,06-Sep-14,-,0,This tablet is both fast to boot up as one would expect from a chrome operating system. It is pretty easy to use even for ananolog man in a digital age. I had never used a touch screen device before and am new to chrome. It isn't intuitive for me but I am learning. It is fun to use. I am a little disappointed that it has almost no use ability without wi_fi. With everything on the cloud not having connectivity is indeed a cloudy day
B00DVFLJKQ,30,295,This oughta be a crime. I am having too much fun :-),Hug,5,Yes,28-Jan-14,2,0,"This is everything that it is advertise to be. I was planning on rooting it before I got it., but why ruin a good thing? This is pure Google, pure performance and you can't beat the price :-) oh and if you do order this and you're looking for an HDMI TV out adapter that ACTUALLY WORKS, I ordered the Accell slimPort HDMI adapter from Amazon. check my reviews. :-)"
B00DVFLJKQ,30,296,"excellent 7"" android tablet",Kindle Customer,5,Yes,18-Apr-14,1,1,"This is an excellent 7"" android tablet. It has a pure, up to date android O/S. The display is crisp and bright. The case is easy to grip and hold. The tablet is light weight and solid built. The 32 GB of internal storage is more than adequate for my needs. The processor is current and handles all my tasks in a fast manner. All this at a very reasonable price. Thank you Amazon, Google and Asus."
B00DVFLJKQ,30,297,Great tablet. I bought this to install in the ...,Jordan,5,Yes,07-Apr-17,-,0,Great tablet. I bought this to install in the dash of my car initially but have been using it more than just in the car. It's very snappy and works very well. Only problem I've had is that the screen seems to be loose in one of the corners. Not sure how this happened but it's not a deal break for me.
B00DVFLJKQ,30,298,The tablet itself is excellent and I'm very pleased with it,Stephen Austin,4,Yes,24-Oct-14,-,0,"The tablet itself is excellent and I'm very pleased with it. However, the Google Nexus Guidebooks are next to useless. The 2012 version is slightly better than the 2013 version but all either of them do is describe some of the features available. Neither tells how to use them or actually how to do much of anything. What the little icons mean and how to select and issue the commands is left up to the user to figure out by trial and error."
B00DVFLJKQ,30,299,Buy an iPad.,A. Holub,2,Yes,17-May-15,1,1,"So so. The battery runs down very quickly when you're *not* using it. I bought it only to play movies on long plane flights. The thing sits for a few weeks between flights, and the battery is always dead-dead when I try to turn it on. Should have bought a 7"" iPad air, which is better in both the hardware and software department."
B00DVFLJKQ,30,300,My brother recommended it and I sold my Apple tablet for this ...,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,23-Nov-15,1,0,It freezes all the time if I put it off while the radio is playing. It freezes while I play most of the games on it. And everytime it freezes I need to reainstall everything on it...reset from ZERO. My brother recommended it and I sold my Apple tablet for this piece of crap...my biggest mistake!
B00DVFLJKQ,31,301,"Fast, responsive and everything you need in a tab..",Akshay,5,Yes,10-Oct-16,-,0,"This might be little late for the review but at the time of release this was a perfect android tab with fast and responsive experience. I still use it after many years and it works great. I take it on hikes for tracking, use it to read books, music and connect it to my chrome cast tv. It never gave any problems."
B00DVFLJKQ,31,302,"decent, with an annoying defect",A. Sridharan,2,Yes,04-Apr-15,-,0,"I bought this since I lost my original nexus. I like this one, except for one annoying defect - the auto (or manual) dimming feature doesn't work when you are reading a kindle book! It automatically goes to maximum brightness mode and wouldn't change no matter what I did. It is frustrating, especially when you are in a night flight, not to mention that it strains your eyes."
B00DVFLJKQ,31,303,Love the extreme lightness of this version,Elmervic V. Borgonia Jr.,5,Yes,04-Aug-14,2,0,"Definite improvement from my 2012 version. As always, very versatile and compact GNex7 packs the power and reliability I've come to expect from an Android powered product. Love the extreme lightness of this version; pretty much goes with me wherever I go and not as bulky as my older iPad. Really won me over to Android for good."
B00DVFLJKQ,31,304,Better luck next time,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,15-Jun-15,5,1,I bought this tablet in December. It just stopped working. I am in chat with an Amazon rep right now. They aren't going to do anything about it so I guess I need to get in touch with ASUS. Six months of use and now it's a brick.
B00DVFLJKQ,31,305,Cheaper alternative to a ipad!,DieselD,5,Yes,01-Sep-14,-,0,I have come to like thee Nexus tablets. Even more so over the ipads and I am typically prefer apple products! For the cost you cant beat them and they are powered by google so they seem to have less freeware crap packed into them unlike the samsung etc. The Android system seems to be very stable and quick. The battery lasts forever it seems! I have two of these for both myself and wife and we end up using them quite a bit.
B00DVFLJKQ,31,306,Five Stars,Mister E2,5,Yes,21-Oct-17,1,0,just as you'd expect no issues -- cheaper ones available but kid needed it for a programming class
B00DVFLJKQ,31,307,"Still The One, and I'm Havin' Fun!",Mari Anne Souza,5,Yes,13-Mar-17,2,0,"I bought this in May, 2014 and it's still as good as when I received it."
B00DVFLJKQ,31,308,Way better than the 2012 Nexus 7,Brian,5,Yes,31-Jan-14,1,0,"Got this to replace my Nexus 2012 tablet. It's night and day. The screen is much brighter and the pictures show more contrast. The performance is much better and I'm able to multi-task more applications. I've experienced no glitches with video (netflix) performance and such. Glad I upgraded to this model as I feel a 7"" tablet is more portable than a 10"", etc. Highly recommend."
B00DVFLJKQ,31,309,Better than I expected,Amy,5,Yes,30-Jan-14,-,0,"I study tablets inside and out and decided on the Nexus 7 for a gift for my son. He is and engineering student at Purdue and he loves everything about the Nexus 7. He did not want an Ipad, but I thought that would be our best option. I am so glad we went with the Nexus. It has a mini port which the IPad does not. The graphics are way better. It just does everything and more than than the Apple for less money. I would buy another, in fact, I think I will."
B00DVFLJKQ,31,310,Great product from Asus and Google,Christopher George,4,Yes,02-Jul-14,-,0,Arrived earlier than expected and boxed clean and clear. I expect to enjoy the nexus for some time. At least it's made by someone other than Samsung. Samsung I hope one day you choke on that 100.00 rebate you cheated me out of some years ago for a piece of crap computer monitor I bought. I have never since nor will I ever in the future purchase a product made by Samsung. I hope one day to laugh and laugh as the ashes of your company rise like disintegrating moths from an eternal flame.
B00DVFLJKQ,32,311,Junky,Peggy,1,Yes,14-Apr-19,-,0,This was very small and battery did not last long with out a charge. Sorry I spent money on this.
B00DVFLJKQ,32,312,Perfect for a good week.,A. Nuon,1,Yes,16-Feb-15,-,0,"When I order nexus 2012 version. It was well built with no issues. So naturally it makes sense to buy 2013 model. I only had the item for a good week and it stop working. Just resets, stuck on log screen or goes into the os but than hangs and resets itself. Once a tablet fails. I'm jumping to a new brand. Nexus has a high rating. Did not think it would fail but it did."
B00DVFLJKQ,32,313,Amazing device with a couple quirks,Chris,5,Yes,17-Feb-15,-,0,"I've had this nexus now for over a year and am so glad I chose this over an iPad mini. Less $$, more memory, better screen! The only knock I have on it is it seems to adjust itself to who is using it thus I need to power it off/on after my son uses it for screen to be truly responsive. Now have an issue with auto rotation that a factory reset is suppose to fix. Still, despite these quirks. Satisfied with choice!"
B00DVFLJKQ,32,314,"While initially my impressions of this tablet were very good, unfortunately this product lacks in quality",Chris,1,Yes,18-Sep-14,2,1,"I purchased the 32GB model shortly after release in August 2013. While initially my impressions of this tablet were very good, unfortunately this product lacks in quality. I'm currently on my 4th RMA with Asus in one year's time. Three of these have been due to the micro USB port flaking out and intermittently not charging properly. I've also had screen rotation issues, which I don't totally understand, but after sleeping/resuming sometimes the accelerator and gyroscope become unresponsive. And as of writing today, the touchscreen has completed stopped working."
B00DVFLJKQ,32,315,"Awesome, Even Used",W. Buck,5,Yes,23-Feb-14,1,0,"Bought this used at a $60 discount (32gb model), couldn't be happier with it.

Running the stock OS is great, I'm a CM guy for my phone but since I'm really only doing games, music, books and movies over wifi on this, plain ol' Android is going awesome. Don't have an iPad mini to compare against, but even compared to our regular iPad its very similar and a great compliment to have around!"
B00DVFLJKQ,32,316,I am slowly discovering all the great features about it,Carol Dresser,5,Yes,10-May-16,-,0,"I purchased this rather than an I Pad after seeing a co-worker using hers. I am slowly discovering all the great features about it, as it is able to do about a million things and the learning curve is steep!! I am impressed with the screen display as the colours are bright and clear. So far has been exactly what I had in mind when I decided to purchase a tablet."
B00DVFLJKQ,32,317,just buy one,Chris,5,Yes,15-Jan-14,-,0,"This is my first android device, i have been a windows guy since WP7 came out. I previously had a windows 8.1 tablet which i liked very much, but with the announcement that Microsoft was going to bring back more desktop style interaction to windows 8 in the future I felt like the tablet platform was going to die for MS.

So i got a nexus 7, because no one knows android quite like google. And let me say i do not regret it for a second. It is a great size, fits in my back pocket. Wireless charging is fantastic, i have it on my lumia 920 as well so i have a few chargers. Google now is a cool service, but i dont use it a whole lot.

if you want a tablet, buy this one. Dont get an ipad, i dont like ipads. Get what i like, youll be happier."
B00DVFLJKQ,32,318,Blasts through anything I push its way.,LanceJZ,5,Yes,05-Dec-13,1,0,"Now that it has Kitt Katt on it, it blasts through any task I give it, any game I play, any code I compile, any story I write. This device is amazing! I can use it for twelve hours straight browsing the web, chatting, and email while I work and watching videos during break and it can take it! It is the perfect size, I can take it everywhere with me, and it is large enough to see easily.

B00DVFLJKQ,32,319,"Great tablet, nice size",Mary G.,5,Yes,06-Feb-14,-,0,"My husband and I both tried the iPad mini (not the new retina display version) and we were NOT impressed with the graphics - this Nexus 7 is so much sharper, so we returned the iPad minis and got 2 of these.

Most people have already written extensive reviews - I would just concur with the positives. Nice feel, nice size, clear sharp graphics, good speakers, long battery life (so far - only had it a month), plenty of apps available."
B00DVFLJKQ,32,320,Love this Tablet,Tri-Z,5,Yes,24-Jul-16,-,0,"Love this tablet. Clear screen, easy to load apps on it. I use it to read, watch Netflix, email, face book and some games. I have downloaded some games for my grandchildren to play on it. Of course they have accidently dropped it a few time. It has weather their playing and works great!"
B00DVFLJKQ,33,321,Spectacular.,Nathan Post,5,Yes,22-Oct-14,-,0,"Spectacular.

Glorious in every aspect, magnificent to hold, in one hand or two.
I can pound out emails with two thumbs vertically with speed or sit back and enjoy the 1080p Screen for movies.
Those who have given this one star are complaining about earlier android bugs where we saw Kitkat stumble a bit ( nothing that IOS users have not put up with) This tablet is spectacular fast and an amazing companion device."
B00DVFLJKQ,33,322,Bricked from ota update,b.h.,1,Yes,14-Jan-17,-,0,Nexus this is my third asus device that went to crap after some time when the warranty expires and you don't Fix it even though you are not at fault i will never buy another asus product or will condone anyone to buy one....
B00DVFLJKQ,33,323,This is absolutely the best tablet for your money,Zach Underwood,5,Yes,03-Jul-14,-,0,"This is absolutely the best tablet for your money. I paid $220 for mine. I love the resolution. The size is perfect because the display is much larger than a typical phone but you can still type on like you would a 4-5 inch smartphone. It's light enough that it can be easily held in one hand (and my hands are probably average size). The speakers (yes, multiple) are stereo sound. One on either end of the phone. And my #1 favorite feature is the OS. Oh man, I love vanilla Android. I've had a Galaxy S3 for about 1.5 years and I hate TouchWiz and I hate what Samsung has done to Android. But I can't get enough of vanilla Android. The UI is simple yet elegant. The menus and icons are easy to navigate. It's just so intuitive. And since it's a Nexus device it gets all the latest updates from Google."
B00DVFLJKQ,33,324,Great value in a tablet!,"Joseph M. Tyson, Jr.",5,Yes,19-Jan-15,-,0,"Given my disappointment with the new Google Nexus 9 tablet, I was relieved that I could still acquire this older model.

Despite its age, this tablet is a fantastic value with the added benefit of updates directly from Google!

My daughters love the speed of the N7 (2013) compared to their dated, pokey N7 (2012) model running KitKat.
It runs Lollipop with aplomb and the screen is gorgeous."
B00DVFLJKQ,33,325,If you want the latest Android and want version 5.1.1 this is for you.,Shawn Gamble,3,Yes,14-Jun-15,2,0,"I waited a year to get this tablet. When I first read about it sounded like a 4/4 or 5/5. In the time since better more powerful and effective tablets have hit the market which let down my expectations by the time I got it. The truly nine thing it is a pure device in the since it is running Android 5.1.1 and since it was made by Asus for Google, there is no other companies crapware on it. if you always want the latest and greatest of Google and Android this is for you. If you have a good Wi-Fi connection its a quick little sucker asp. If you get the 32 mb version."
B00DVFLJKQ,33,326,"Perfect product, my wife likes it very much!",p2point,5,Yes,25-Feb-14,1,0,"I'm happier to receive them just in couple of days by amazon international shipment.
The first look when bring nexus 7 out of its original package, my wife screamed coz she loved it so much.
Now she use it to read books, watch movies as well as play funny games.
I'm pleased with its cute shape coz it can be brought anywhere without any inconvenience.
I decide to buy a case from amazon.com in order we may easily awake and asleep device without worrying press power bottom too frequently :)
Strongly recommending!
If the pre-charged import tax would be lower I think I'll buy more products from amazon.com by use of its global transportation."
B00DVFLJKQ,33,327,"Very good performance, but battary...",Andria Khanjaliashvili,4,Yes,23-Jan-14,-,2,"I purchased 32GB version running android 4.3 Jelly Bean.
Fortunately I have not problems such as connecting to wi-fi or with TouchScreen, as many people
complained about.

everything works great, Super fast performance, love the Snapdragon's CPU.
Display quality is amazing.

it was advertised battary life up to 9 hours, but my nexus 7 only has 5.5 or 6 hours of battary life.
I have screen brightness set to Auto, Wi-Fi on, sometimes GPS, chrome browsing, reading some e-books.
still no result, it only lasts up to 6 hours. I dont know If my battary is defect or something like that, but it hasn't really 9 hours as noted.
charging time is about 2.5 hours."
B00DVFLJKQ,33,328,Can't be beat,Sgt Apone,5,Yes,09-Jun-14,3,0,"This is my third Nexus 7 tablet. I bought two of the original Nexus 7 2012 tablets for my wife and myself. My wife loves hers and constantly has to charge it because she uses it so much more than her laptop. She currently is still using it and has no complaints.

I reset mine to factory defaults and gave it to my friend's son as a gift, so I bought the newest 2013 version as a replacement. Just as before when I bought my 2012 Nexus, I considered the Ipad mini first. The 32GB mini is more than $200 more expensive, but for me, that isn't the reason I chose the Nexus 7 over the Ipad mini for the second time. The main reason is that I'm just tired of Apple's dumbed down devices. I own an iPhone 4 and I have tried out a a few iPads that belonged to my friends and each time, I still find them boring, impractical and restricting. I won't even go into the mess that is iTunes, which is possibly the worst program I have ever had the displeasure of using.

As of right now, there are 3,270 reviews of this product, so I'm not going to add much more here, as it may never be read anyway. I have access to my entire movie library from my home pc via the Plex app and I have all all of my music installed on the Nexus, by syncing my music on my pc, uploading to Amazon's MP3 cloud player app, and then downloading to my Nexus.

I can also use it for anything I need to work with using Chrome mobile,Google Drive, Gmail, Chrome Remote Desktop, Terminal Emulator,Connect Bot and Hip Chat apps. Given the specs of this tablet and the free range of being able to do anything I want with it, for me the choice was simple."
B00DVFLJKQ,33,329,"Lots of apps, using this with CAD and a bluetooth mouse - update Downgrade to 2 stars. Autorotation, touch sensitivity issues.",Steven J. Greenfield,2,Yes,01-Dec-13,3,0,"I like it. I am very happy with this, lots of apps. I've installed the Kindle app and can read PDFs, and there is even an Office-type app with word processor, spreadsheet, database, etc. Lots of apps for learning about Microchip PIC and Atmel AVR microcontrollers, including the Arduino boards. No good version of the Arduino Sketch IDE has been ported, though.

I'm using a bluetooth mouse with it in order to use a CAD program. A bit different than working on a 19 inch LCD, but I can carry the Nexus with me anywhere. I bought a case and screen protector for it, and carry it with me in a pocket of my cargo pants and the mouse in my other cargo pocket. Yes, I'm a nerd.

The camera seems able to focus closer than the camera in my Samsung phone, something that has come in handy.

I have read that there have been problems using bluetooth keyboards with the Nexus 2013, although an update to Android 4.4 just installed so that may not be an issue any more.

Update: After using this for several years, I'm downgrading my 5 star to a 2 star review.

The autorotation randomly stops working. I've installed an app to check the sensor, the sensor works fine. Yet it often gets ""stuck"" in portrait or landscape, and it doesn't seem to matter which app it is running. It has been this way through a number of updates to the Android OS.

The touchscreen randomly desensitizes. So one moment I can swipe a finger, the next moment I must spread my left hand palm across the back and use two fingers on the screen or it won't respond.

Bluetooth is a problem. I seem to have found a number of devices that work on other Android devices, but not this."
B00DVFLJKQ,33,330,Great tablet,cbr,5,Yes,05-Jan-14,-,0,"Beautiful screen, decent interface, snappy response time, plug and play with my home pc (win7) and light weight. We purchased the slimline case for $15 which also works well.

On the down side the battery life is just okay when playing back movies and there isn't a sd slot for storage expansion. The camera isn't anything to write home about either but for the price I still think it's an excellent deal. You still seem to get 8 to 10 hours of normal use so all and all not bad. I've owned a iPad before (9.5"" model) and I the nexus holds it's own for the most part but considering it's half the cost I would recommend it to others."
B00DVFLJKQ,34,331,Smoking fast and kick ass,Hojosan,5,Yes,29-Dec-13,1,0,I got this for my mom. I have the prior Nexus 7 and love it. This one is considerably faster but otherwise seems identical. I recommend chucking out the original software and putting on open source stuff. I use Cyanogenmod on both mine and my mom's and it works perfectly and is lightning fast. She upgraded from an iPad and can't believe how much nicer this thing is.
B00DVFLJKQ,34,332,"""Died"" after 16 months.",Dionysis,1,Yes,03-Feb-15,6,0,"This is a product review after having this tablet for 16 months. Admittedly, I loved it initially. Very nice screen, fast and smooth performance. The only drawback was a mediocre battery life. I actually purchased it a few weeks after its original release. However, after 16 months (December 2014) when performing the official Android 5 update the tablet could not boot. It froze in the Google logo. Recovery mode, fastboot mode could not make the table work again. So, even though out of warranty (it is 12 months) I sent it to Asus service. They recommended a motherboard change for a total cost of 200$ !!! As everyone may understand this price is unacceptable and close to the original price of the tablet ($269). Hence, my whole experience with this Asus nexus branded tablet is awful as I had high expectations from nexus branded products."
B00DVFLJKQ,34,333,A Personal Favorite!!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,30-Jul-14,2,0,"I've had this for over a year now and I still carry it with me EVERYWHERE I go. I often use it (when connected to wifi) as a replacement for my smartphone for nearly everything except for phone calls (which with the right app you can also do). The tablet is fast, easy to use, the display looks amazing and this is overall the best and my personal favorite tablet I've ever owned, including over the iPad."

B00DVFLJKQ,34,335,Over a year now and very happy,tamrick,5,Yes,30-Aug-16,-,0,Had it over a year now gave it to my 5 year old child. He always maxes out the memory. He dis manage to freeze up the tablet some how. I sent it back to nexus at 11 months of owning it. Came back and works flawless. Free shipping and great customer support.
B00DVFLJKQ,34,336,"This is a light, compact, and fast Android tablet.",Seth Smith,5,Yes,05-Nov-13,-,0,"There were no problems in setup or configuration. It detected all my Play Store apps and downloaded them. Went through two system updates without a hitch. Screen is beautiful and sharp. Feels and looks solid.

Compatibility: Only MLB app live streaming video didn't work. All my other apps worked fine.

Did I say fast? Downloading and installing app updates seems to take almost no time at all.

Only issue is the back is not ""grippy"" enough for my hands so it is a little difficult to hold at times."
B00DVFLJKQ,34,337,Present for my son - no regrets,cheddar,5,Yes,15-Nov-15,-,0,"I bought this as a birthday present for my 4yr old son and he loves it, my 6 yr old son loves it, and I really like using it versus my phone. Screen is a good size, picture quality is excellent, and the sound is pretty loud. I am so glad I got this one versus any other tablet I shopped around for."
B00DVFLJKQ,34,338,Nexus 7... Dreaming of Electric Sheep,G. Adams,5,Yes,14-Feb-14,1,0,"Bought this as a gift for my wife and she doesn't put it down. The smart phone gets left on the counter and she uses the Nexus 7 for everything except answering the phone. Fast browsing speed, awesome picture, definitely worth the money. So, if you don't want to spend the money for an iPad (or have an aversion to apples), this is a good alternative."
B00DVFLJKQ,34,339,I liked mine so much that I bought one for my husband!!,Linda Rivers,5,Yes,07-Jun-14,1,0,"My husband bought me one of these tablets for my birthday last year. I use it all the time and I loved it so much that I bought him one for our anniversary a couple months ago. He hated his big 10"" tablet from work because it was so bulky. This one is thin and light and just right for reading or sitting on the couch and he loves his so much that I can't get him to put it down. The battery life is also a thing of wonder. Because of it, he never has to put it down. I've read for ten hours straight without needing to plug it in. In fact, I pass out before it does. I would recommend it to anyone who has wi-fi and doesn't need a modem. It's perfect."
B00DVFLJKQ,34,340,Great tablet. TOUCHSCREEN FIX linked within review.,Roy,4,Yes,14-Mar-16,2,0,"Came with one dead pixel but still functioned fine for a while.

TOUCHSCREEN ISSUES
After about a year, touchscreen began to behave oddly and I would experience phantom touches, no response or little response to touches, and one precise touch with my finger (when typing for example) being registered as many touches across many areas on the screen. Was able to fix the touchscreen issues. However, to this day, I still get force closes and random reboots (even when using the tablet in a non-intensive manner). I experienced this on stock builds and after flashing many different ROMs that are well tested and reviewed to be more stable than the stock builds that Google pushes to the tablet. Might have received one of the faulty ones. Still an amazing tablet despite all the issues. One of the most used and most useful products that I have ever purchased.

TOUCHSCREEN FIX
Was able to fix my touchscreen by following this video:
Fix Nexus 7 Touch Screen Issues(easy hw fix)
by drHerrscher on youtube.

Just as the poster of the video shows, you have to open up the tablet and tape something like cardboard or folded paper to the connectors so that they sandwich together with the backplate when it is closed. This prevents the connectors from moving over time. Apparently the loose connections cause the touchscreen issues. After applying the fix, I haven't had any noticeable issues with my tablet touchscreen."
B00DVFLJKQ,35,341,trouble recieving,Dale A. Joiner,5,Yes,18-Jan-14,-,0,Twice I have ordered this item and both times it never reached me thankfully amazon has tried to fix the problem they are sending one more out to me. The first one was left on my porch and disappeared. The 2nd one sent to me shows delivered but nothing was in the box i received. Now they are sending me a third one hopefully this one makes it here like its supposed to. well crossing my fingers it shows up
B00DVFLJKQ,35,342,Great picture but Doesn't have a long life,Christina A. Heedles,5,Yes,23-Jun-18,-,1,Love this tablet even though it is discontinued and over priced eventually it doesn't charge and will need replacement but has a great HD picture for streaming video
B00DVFLJKQ,35,343,Nexus 7 2013 edition 32GB,LAR,5,Yes,26-Mar-14,1,0,"This is by far the best tablet in terms of size, weight, screen resolution, sound quality, price, build quality, and performance. Asus has done it again for Google-Android tablets. This machine does not disappoint on any level. The IPAD is inferior only due to it's awkward shape that doesn't fit in your palm and being ridiculously overpriced."
B00DVFLJKQ,35,344,Problems -- maybe will get fixed.,ScottF,3,Yes,23-Oct-13,5,0,"Purchased this through Amazon, and after trying to use it for a couple of weeks am returning it. (That's the great thing about Amazon.)

On the plus side, it's a gorgeous display, wifi good enough (not great), and I got a nice lock on GPS, even indoors near a south-facing window.

However, there were three big problems:

1. The touch screen had problems -- intermittent, but frequent and very annoying. There were many occasions when I had to hit a link, button, or keyboard ""key"" multiple times before it would register. I've seen other complaints about this online, so I'm not sure if the problem is a defective unit, bad design, or bad software.

2. I've experienced a number of software crashes -- programs freezing or exiting mysteriously. Most of these occurred in programs that came with the device -- I did not keep it long enough to download a lot of third-party apps.

3. In general, navigating this thing and setting up the settings I want were MUCH less intuitive on this version of Android than on iOS devices.

It's possible that all three problems were software and will get fixed in future updates. In that case, it would be a great device at a great price. But I can't be sure of that, so I decided to return it within the 30-day window."
B00DVFLJKQ,35,345,I liked the Nexus 7 a lot though so I decided ...,jam,5,Yes,08-Dec-15,-,0,I had a Nexus 7 with only 8 GB and it was so restrictive as to how many apps I could install and it kept locking up. I liked the Nexus 7 a lot though so I decided to splurge on this one with 32 GB. I'm very happy with this one so far. No apps have locked up yet - knock on wood!
B00DVFLJKQ,35,346,Best Android Tablet,Kenneth Rivera,5,Yes,27-Aug-13,1,0,"This is a very solid product, from the OS to the hardware design. The price is great, is inexpensive and that doesn't mean is cheap - on the complete opposite it is a top-end device.

-=-=--

Like:
- Size, it could fit it on a jean back pocket if I have to.
- Screen, nice a clear for reading
- Battery Life, on my regular usage it holds around 2 days - and on stand-by it could hold weeks.

I primary use it for my reading device, Comics, Kindle books, news on internet, some games - and it's perfect!

-=-=--

Only bad thing I can think of, I won't recommend it for photography then don't buy it - camera is not good and do not have flash. But the device wasn't meant to be a camera or replace your mobile phone - it is a content consuming device."
B00DVFLJKQ,35,347,Absolutely GREAT little tablet!!!,RAHAlpha,5,Yes,24-Nov-14,2,0,"If you are reading this, I'll assume you're already somewhat familiar with tablets and OSs etc. Personally, I'm a big Android fan and this is truly a great little tablet. I won't get real technical, just practical.

The size is ""just right"" for my hands. The screen is Fantastic!!! It's Bright, super sharp and just a pleasure to read on or even watch a movie. This tablet is fast, touch responsive and, being a Nexus, not a lot of bloat to deal with. Over the years I've used a couple other ""less expensive"" 7 or 8 in tablets and wasn't happy with the performance. Then I tried an 8.9 in that had good performance but it's just a little big. I also used a wonderful Transformer Prime with keyboard that is a great tablet semi-laptop but, for my uses now, I just wanted a smaller tablet good for catching up on the news and reading a few books. Surfing the web is quick on my home wireless. For reading pdfs (or books only in pdf format) print is a little small but that's Adobe Reader's fault, not the Nexus.

I do root my Android products but mainly so I can freeze a little bloatware. I have Android 4.4.4 now but have the notice to go to Lollipop. I'm hesitant because I don't want to loose root. I also run Go Launcher EX too. It doesn't slow this tablet down at all and everything I have tried works great; music player, photo editor, etc. I even use the Nexus as a backup drive to make copies of photos when I'm on the road. With a simple OTG cable and a card reader (and the right app) it's great. I do wish I could use a micro SD with it, but with 32GB it really does have enough room. At one point I had about 1000 mp3s on it and about 400 pics (RAWs and jpegs) and had plenty of room left.

Though the speakers face back, they're still pretty good. I'm pleased with them certainly for news video and even for music when I don't bother to get my earphones (Skull Candy buds: GREAT!!) out. Funny, with the case I use (folding front cover type) with the cover folded back in my hands it actually enhances the sound back forward.

Recommended? You bet. Functionality wise, i's lots more than a Kindle or other e-reader. Size wise, much more manageable than the bigger tablets I've tried. I really do like and recommend this Nexus 7 (2013)"
B00DVFLJKQ,35,348,Love my tablet,Robin Burch,5,Yes,12-Jun-16,-,0,"Came promptly, packaged well. Love my tablet. Easy to use. Not one single problem with it. This wasn't my 1st tablet, had one before, this brand. Very reliable. Love that I don't need to sit at a desktop computer, can use it for work or play catchup on FB or do email or for games. It's a great tablet and would highly recommend this brand!

It has basically replaced my laptop and the size is perfect, especially when I want to be outside where I can enjoy the Kindle ap and read from many of ebooks that I have purchased. I looked at the larger tablets but I can say 100% that I am very pleased with this tablet and glad I purchased it. No buyers remorse or regrets."
B00DVFLJKQ,35,350,great tablet,jesse may,5,Yes,23-Mar-14,-,0,"I did research before deciding on this tablet. Amazing screen clarity , great price, stand up to iPad 4 in most benchmarks at half the price. I had already bought one from bestbuy before I got the 2nd amazon. Now my wife and I both have one , amazon was cheaper by $100 but that is because I got extended warranty from best buy and they charge tax. Would have bought both from amazon if I had thought to."
B00DVFLJKQ,36,351,Best tablet that I have ever owned. Had issues on early units though.,Digitalmaster,5,Yes,23-Aug-13,2,0,"I took a break from the Nexus 7 (2013) for a while, after returning four bad units. I loved everything about this tablet, but continued having issues on my first four units. I am happy to say that I am no longer having the issue, as far as I can tell, on my 5th device (which is manufactured after September 2013). All of the issues seem to have been fixed, and I suspect a bad factory or component on early units.

I definitely recommend this tablet for the holiday season. It is by far the best tablet on the market currently. I would like to see an 8 inch and a 12 inch tablet however.

Update (November 25th): The tablet still seems to be working perfectly. I am glad that I purchased it again. For those of you concerned about some of the issues, see my notes below. most of the issues are related to the first few months of manufacturing. MY table was manufactured in September and I am having zero problems with it.

Previous review (kept to demonstrate the problems that I had with early units):
I am on my FOURTH device. All three of my previous devices were plagued with issues. Specifically, the device freezes up very often for about 30 seconds to a minute. All previous devices seem to have a multitouch problem, specifically on the bottom of the screen where the spacebar is. So I have quite a bit of a problem when it comes to typing on this.

With all that being said, the device is excellent and way better than the first Nexus 7 (which was the best tablet last year, in my opinion). I would suggest buying it from a reputable company, and just return the device for another until you get one that no longer has issues. Now that I am on my 4th device, I am getting a little tired of having to go through the process though.

I am an experienced user, so this is not user error. I had several copies of the original Nexus 7, the Asus Transformer, and the Nexus 10. So I'm very familiar with using tablets, etc. Asus just has some problems at their factories, in my opinion, that need to be addressed.

Based on many of the reviews that I have seen online, not everybody is experiencing these issues; which is what leads me to believe it has something to do with the factory that some of them are coming from."
B00DVFLJKQ,36,352,Nexus 7 FTW,Tweak,5,Yes,30-Sep-14,-,0,"It's a Nexus so of course it is nice, works great for my main usage which is running Torque in the Abarth. I also like using it for an offline maps program, nothing wrong with a 7in GPS screen! Buy a nice case for it and you're set, not much they should change about this unit unless they gave a more tactile feel, otherwise great little tablet."
B00DVFLJKQ,36,353,What an amazing device!,W. Brunner,4,Yes,25-Nov-13,2,0,"This is my first device of this type and I have no experience to compare operating systems or much of anything else on this tablet. I have a recently purchased my first Samsung smart phone which I rarely use, but I do spend about 20 hrs a week on the home computer.

After a week, I am very impressed with the Nexus 7. I was more than concerned about technical issues with the tablet after reading reviews, enough so that I decided not to buy a pre-owned tablet, no matter how good a price it may have seemed. Amazon had a great price on this with the 2 yr warranty (double what Radio Shack offered). I couldn't be more pleased!

The main reason I bought this was for the exceptional HD screen clarity, which this does not disappoint. Compared to a few other tablets I have listened to, the sound is fantastic.

I also bought the Omoton case (B00E6NKBXI), amFilm screen saver (B00FRIJPCY) which is considerably smudged after just a few hours of use, a Keyboard stand/case (B00EDTTIXE) which has not yet arrived, and the ""Google Nexus 7 Tablet: Visual QuickStart Guide"", which I very highly recommend.

Even having watched 10 yrs of You Tube instructions on the tablet, the book was mandatory for me. I have learned a great deal in just a few days. Next to the tablet purchase, the book was probably the most important accessory I could have purchased.

Update: Nov 27th, 2013. 1 week later, the backlight had been flickering just barely noticeably for a couple of days, something I thought might have been part of the notifications process and loading many apps. On day six, it started blanking out while in use, picking it up or going back to a locked screen after just minutes of use.

I checked the symptoms on You Tube. Sure enough it was a loose battery connector. I called Google and was told to return the unit. The price had gone up $44 since I bought it a week prior. Amazon was excellent and offered to refund the difference after I bought another Nexus at full price. Still waiting for that to arrive.

Beware of the problems and price fluctuations."
B00DVFLJKQ,36,354,Completely broke in 10 months - ASUS wouldn't fix it,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,10-Oct-14,3,0,"I've had this for about 10 months now. Everything was fine, and I was happy with the tablet, until it stopped working. Basically it just wouldn't power on or charge. I tried all the various trouble-shooting that I found online. Finally I called ASUS and had a case created for me.

They just emailed me and said there's damage to the motherboard, which isn't covered warranty, and it will cost $200 to fix it. First of all, there isn't any external physical damage, so I don't understand how I could have done anything to damage the internal motherboard. I feel that it's a faulty product, but they won't do anything to help me fix it, and they're trying to blame it on me instead.

So not only will they not fix it for me for free, they amount they want to charge me is pretty much the SAME amount as a brand new tablet! If I had to buy a brand new one, I would NOT put my money towards another one of these, because it broke within one year of use.

I would NOT recommend this product, because I feel they have horrible customer service, warranty, and billing procedures and policies. And obviously, the product isn't made to last over a year. I did take good care of the tablet, and even had a very durable case on it."
B00DVFLJKQ,36,355,This. Buy it. Now.,CarrotCakeClancy,5,Yes,15-Oct-14,4,0,"Love this thing. I've got a Macbook Pro, iPad, iPhone and my Nexus. I'm really glad I decided to purchase this tablet to give me a taste of the Android side of things, and I'm absolutely thrilled with it. In fact, I had the 2012 model I sold to purchase this 2013 model for the faster internals. I'll always be an Apple fan, but this is the best 7"" tablet you can get right now hands down. For the price, there's nothing out there with the features, clean design, and clean android. The only thing missing is MicroSD; you're stuck with the 32GB. However, I did get a flash drive to show up using an OTA USB cable - once. I'm working on that, I have a bad feeling I'll be rooting the tablet to get the usb functions I want. And I'm so looking forward to Android L - one reason I'm holding out on rooting or flashing for now.

Basically, coming from the 'Apple Guy', if you're looking for a 7"" Android tablet, get this. Don't look any further - it's a winner."
B00DVFLJKQ,36,356,"5-Star Hardware, Horribly Buggy Software Loader (but read on for a fix)",John B.,5,Yes,19-Sep-13,4,0,"There is no beating the technology (it's rated the #1 Android tablet and is second only to the Apple iPad). However, there is a software problem that will drive you nuts, BUT IT'S EASY TO FIX. The app launcher keeps ending abnormally with a message of ""Launcher has stopped"", which causes your Home screen to be reset to its original state, so all of the folders and apps you placed on it are gone!

I was pulling my hair out over this for 3 days. I'd redo my 60+ apps in multiple folders on the Home screen, but they eventually would be replaced by the factory default screen. After investigating the problem, I discovered the cause was that the launcher app that came with the device wasn't ready for Android 4.3. The solution is to replace it by going to Google Play and installing a new launcher of your choice (which I recommend even if your default launcher has been fixed). I chose ""Nova Launcher Free"" because it was rated best in web articles that compare launcher apps. I quickly concluded it is a fantastic improvement over the original launcher! For example, there is no need to ""press and drag"" an unwanted app icon to the trash bin. Instead, just press the icon then select from the popup menu options of ""Edit"", ""Remove"", ""App Info"", or ""Uninstall"". This alone is a time saver, and the additional new options are very convenient.

I also replaced the original Google Keyboard with the free ""Hacker's Keyboard"" because it's like a standard computer keyboard in landscape mode (with letters, numbers, special characters, and navigation arrows). This is very, very nice for a long time user of full size keyboards trying to transition to smaller dimensions.

Now it's an absolute pleasure to use this exquisite tablet! The software headaches are gone!

September 21, 2013 Update:
Just fixed a Netflix app problem (whereby it could not open under Android 4.3) by applying the latest Android fix. Updates are available on this tablet in ""Settings - About Tablet - System updates""."
B00DVFLJKQ,36,357,Nexus? Android? I see what you did there google!,Alexander S.D.,5,Yes,15-Apr-18,-,0,"It's been over 4 years and I still love this puppy, it works great, it's convenient - Along with the purchase of a Bluetooth keyboard, it makes it a compact PC. It's a great buy. If you can still find them."
B00DVFLJKQ,36,358,Great so far.,James Henry Willis,4,Yes,21-Mar-14,-,0,"I've only had it a few days, but I'm very impressed with it.If you use your computer to compute, there's probably not much difference between devices, but if you buy for audio-visual excitement, this is the one for you. Sounds good and the screen is fantastic.Good price too. I would love to have a card slot and the on/off switch a little easier to find and use, but everything else is A+."
B00DVFLJKQ,36,359,19 year old grandson loves loves loves it!,Dona Lee Roby,5,Yes,27-Jul-14,-,0,I purchased thisas a birthday present for my 19 year old grandson. He called me thanking me profusely and could not say enough good about it.my offer to him was a tablet of his choice no limitations.this was exactly what he wanted. He could have had Apple's iPad. Anything that makes a teenager that happy and that satisfied is worth its weight in gold.
B00DVFLJKQ,36,360,Fantastic Tablet,Brent,5,Yes,23-Jan-14,-,0,"Got this because i'm in transit alot and it gets boring waiting at the airport. Installed the kindle app, as well as a media manager. Now i can connect my usb stick and watch movies for as long as the battery would allow ( which is usually long enough but i got a Limeade 15600mAh External Battery Pack as backup) or catch up on novels / magazines etc.

No regrets so far. Would suggest a Travel Cover to protect against scratches."
B00DVFLJKQ,37,361,Defective Pixels - Updated,Jake,4,Yes,27-Aug-13,2,1,"I bought the 2013 Nexus 7 and kept it in the box until the screen protector and case arrived. Yesterday I finally powered it up, installed apps, and while watching ""La Luna"", an animated short film that came free with the device, I noticed a defect in the screen. There's a red cloudy area, about 1 cm in diameter, a little left of center in portrait orientation. At the very beginning of the film, when the screen is all black (just before the Disney castle appears), it's very noticeable and bright. I tried watching the video on all of my other devices, and the red blotch wasn't there, so I figured it wasn't part of the video. I then tried other completely black screen shots on the new Nexus 7 and the red splotch was still there. I just requested a replacement from Amazon, but it's ""temporarily sold out"" and the estimated shipment date is over a month away. I'll update this review whenever I can get my hands on a replacement. Otherwise, the tablet is great. It's fast, the dual speakers sound great (for a tablet), and the screen is very sharp.
*Update 9/13/13: I did receive a replacement a few weeks ago and this one does not have the problem that the original one had. It does, however, have a single dead pixel near the top of the screen. The dead pixel is only noticeable when the screen is completely black and the brightness is turned up all the way. Even then, you have to really search for it for a while before you it, because the pixel density on this screen is so high (that's the nice thing about a full HD screen). I decided to keep this one, because I've read other reviews where people had to go through numerous replacement before they finally got one that was perfect, many had more than one dead pixel."
B00DVFLJKQ,37,362,"Better hardware from the original Nexus 7, but may experience some issues",Anthony Spaulding,4,Yes,18-Nov-13,3,0,"I had the original Nexus 7 and it never had any problems. However, the speakers on the new model stopped working after a month. I then called Asus and they wanted me to pay for postage and it would take about 2 weeks for me to get the system back. This option did not sit well with me so I called Amazon and they were willing to provide me another new system and provide overnight shipping at no cost. I have been using the new Nexus for several months now and had noticed that I can't play and see videos on some websites that had no problems playing on my original Nexus 7. I give this device 4 stars as a result of the mechanical and software issues."
B00DVFLJKQ,37,363,Great Tablet,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,27-Dec-13,-,0,"This tablet exceeded my expectations. I bought it to replace my Kindle Fire. Due to a limited Android OS in the Kindle I wasn't able to download the Google App for books and there sre Android deficiencies in the Kindle. For a few extra dollars I can now purchase books from any on-line source. It's also lightweight, great resolution, battery life and recharge time are acceptable."
B00DVFLJKQ,37,364,Great tablet,Christian S,4,Yes,17-Mar-14,-,0,"I like this table since it is from google and it gets all the updates. I used to use it daily. Sometimes I do feel like cellphone and tablet might be too much. I dont have that much time free now and I see myself using more my nexus 5 than the tablet. Still I think it is good for traveling. You can buy some movies or tv shows, download them and watch them on the airplane or train."
B00DVFLJKQ,37,365,** - BEST TABLET CHOICE - **,Knowledge is Power,5,Yes,05-Nov-16,2,0,"WOW! This was a great purchase!! My wife saw a Kindle Fire and she said that was exactly what she wanted. So I did a little reading and informed her that while the Kindle Fire was ok, the Nexus 7 would be ...better. (I was only slightly convinced at the time). She would not be swayed and the Kindle is now a part of her daily life, and I suppose she still likes it. I opted for the Nexus 7 2013 32g and a Minisuit bluetooth keyboard/protective case that acts as a stand... she and the daughter are both jealous but neither will admit it ;) I often cast a YouTube video onto the Visio TV and effectively take over the TV and before long requests on what to play next are flying at me like popcorn. But I digress. The Nexus 7 was my choice and I've watched helplessly as the Mrs. has struggled with her choice; while I am often encouraged to ""fix"" her Kindle, there is only so much I can do. I wish everyone could have had the Nexus 7 2013, I really do. The only way it could be better would be if I had gotten the cellular connectivity. I did not. Mine is wfi only but the hangouts dialer lets me make calls. Mostly to corporations that I prefer not to leave MY number with.
In the beginning, I kinda wanted a tablet - but didn't know much about them. My decision to go with this one was almost ""off the cuff"" except for that ""light reading"" I did upon my wife's suggestion for a Kindle Fire. Now that I have gotten used to this little fellow, I hate leaving it at home, but I have to travel lite when I work.
If anyone is undecided about making a purchase, I would like to tell you - I am very happy with mine. It fits in my back pocket when I need both hands, the battery life is totally cool and perfectly acceptable per the amount of use it gets. I've made it a habit to turn it on ""airplane mode"" when I'm at work, so it doesn't sit there and run itself down. I can run it down reading, shopping, researching, checking the weather... you get the picture. GET THE NEXUS"
B00DVFLJKQ,37,366,Good buy,James Evans,4,Yes,27-May-14,-,0,"Bought used after comparing Nexus to other major brands. Reviews (hopefully independent) indicate Nexus a better device than others. Price new was out of my reach, but the price I paid used was reasonable, and the device arrived ""like new"", as advertised. My granddaughter loves it, and I use it too little. Maybe she can teach me more (she's almost 10)."
B00DVFLJKQ,37,367,Adding Accounts is Great,J. Horne,5,Yes,27-Dec-13,-,0,If you want to share this with other people this is perfect. You can lock down what you don't want others to access so they can't buy stuff with your account or access content that may be age inappropriate. Great for a kids first tablet. The size is good and so is the battery life. Wireless charging is a plus for little hands that may have trouble plugging in micro USB connectors.
B00DVFLJKQ,37,368,Excellent Tablet,Nancy Henderson,5,Yes,04-Feb-14,-,0,"I bought this tablet for my Secretary. I have the ipad air but she is a pc person. She loves this Nexus 7 Tablet, it is perfect for her. She has the iphone so is familiar with Apple products , I asked her how it compared, she said this is just perfect for me. I have downloaded my sheet music to it and can play the piano right from my tablet its so convenient."
B00DVFLJKQ,37,369,"Week old, glitches and doesn't always acknowledge touch screen",Renae,2,Yes,26-Feb-14,2,1,"I'm not very impressed right now. I've had this tablet for a week and the screen doesn't always acknowledge my touch. I've also watched it glitch out a few times, the screen turning black and white. I'd really like a refund or a different tablet, I feel like I wasted money I barely have to shell out for this product. I was told this was one of the best tablet's around by several people who have the Nexus 7. I disagree and regret this purchase especially now since it's taken me 30 mins plus to try and type this review."
B00DVFLJKQ,37,370,A true five star tablet!!!,James,5,Yes,25-Nov-15,-,0,"This is a great tablet. Excellent screen, solid build and fast! It is soooo much better than my more expensive Samsung Tab 4. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for the best bang for the buck out there for a tablet."
B00DVFLJKQ,38,371,"I like 7"" tablets rocking stock android",Ken,5,Yes,26-Jan-16,-,0,"I am a big fan of small form factor tablets and pure Android. The Nexus 7 nails it on both counts. I can't wait for the Spring '16 refresh. This will then go to my mom. Really fast, smooth and ""holdable"". I like 7"" tablets rocking stock android. Bliss."
B00DVFLJKQ,38,372,"Started as a great thing, wonderful screen",Vaulter98c,2,Yes,06-Sep-14,1,1,"Started as a great thing, wonderful screen, very fast, gets all the latest OS's first, seriously this was awesome. Then it just stopped working about 10 months in. Junk. So I go on and google around, turns out its a pretty common thing. I moved to a windows tablet because that's what I need for my Army stuff but I was hoping to give this to my wife. Nope. Instead $250 down the drain, gone, wasted.

Get something else that will last longer, not this flaky model."
B00DVFLJKQ,38,373,Replaced my old Nook tablet with this ...,Sue from CA,5,Yes,05-Jun-14,-,0,"... and I'm not disappointed. loved my Nook, and I still use it from time to time. B&N had some nice features, like having my current book right on my home screen, but my new Nexus more than makes up for those few losses. Love the size of this Nexus, and love having full Android features,like both Kindle and Nook books on the same booked."
B00DVFLJKQ,38,374,Best Tablet for the Price,Rick R. Emerson,5,Yes,22-Apr-14,1,0,"In my opinion, this is the best tablet for the price. I have had very few problems with it and am able to do pretty much anything I want with it. It is just small enough to fit in my back pocket, but big enough to have my notes to teach from. The one drawback that I can think of is that the audio level is way too quiet. The built-in speaker should easily be able to handle twice the volume level that it currently does, which makes it almost useless to try to listen to audio if there is any background noise. I have read, that this problem can be fixed by rooting the device, but I am not ready to take that step yet. I can overcome the lack of volume by using external speaker or headphones for now."
B00DVFLJKQ,38,375,top quality and perfect size for a good price,Patrick Freeman,5,Yes,02-Jun-14,-,0,"Great screen, perfect size for holding in one hand. Good speakers for a mobile device, loud and clear. Very responsive and does everything fast, switching between apps, playing games, browsing, videos, all work great. Love it for browsing Netflix and then casting what I choose to my chromecast stick on the TV, or using Google music, fantastic device."
B00DVFLJKQ,38,376,Pleased with it so far,Notarat,5,Yes,20-Dec-13,-,0,"First thing I did upon receiving it is root it and throw CM10.1 on it. Very pleased with it thus far, but it is not quite as capable as my Asus TF-700, probably due to using a different processor.

I use this in my car mainly to play back music through my Blue Tooth connection and it does that very well, even handling playback of videos downloaded from Youtube."
B00DVFLJKQ,38,377,Great little tablet,Tom & Cathy,5,Yes,19-Jun-14,-,0,This turned out to be a great little tablet! Liked it so much we got the 10 inch version as well. (Mostly because the wife wouldn't let me have my tablet back!) Now that she has the Nexus 10 I use this tablet all the time. So much more convient than having to boot up my computer. Awesome display quality and quick response. It has terrific battery life as well. I like it better than the i-pad we had before.
B00DVFLJKQ,38,378,Near perfect E-book reader/ news and weather tablet,ingineer,5,Yes,25-Mar-14,-,0,"This replaces my Toshiba Thrive 7 inch.
I miss the SD card a little bit, however Dropbox makes up for it.
Very clear display, much improved overall size, fits into cargo pockets.
Not too much bloatware, very high battery life.
Love the fact that it charges on The Panasonic QE-Tm101 even with a case, that's less wear on the USB port.
Just drop it into place , no fumbling around with cables.
Still playing around with it, but so far near to perfection.
Best bang for the buck"
B00DVFLJKQ,38,379,Blows away my Ipad,YoYo Professional,5,Yes,24-Dec-13,2,0,"There literally has been nothing I have disliked so far. The only other tablet I have is an Ipad so all of my comparisons are against that. The size of the Nexus 7 is perfect. I tried an Ipad mini at the store but it was just a little less comfortable than the Nexus 7 and I have big hands. I was amazed how much different just 1 inch of tablet size felt. The Nexus is also lightweight yet extremely high quality and this was very important for me. My Ipad isn't any higher quality and the extra weight leads to more damage if it gets dropped. Not the other way around. In fact I watched some ""drop tests"" on Youtube and the Nexus was the only one I saw that when dropped didn't break the screen. Though I would call this lucky, the best protection is obviously a case.

Then there is the screen. I was like Retina who?? It literally surpasses my Ipad in everyway. If you want the best screen the Nexus 7 is for you, if you are just an easy sell by fancy names then maybe the Ipad is for you. There is nothing bad about my Ipad it just isn't as good. Every Apple product I own is just hype and marketing, based on my experience

The last thing is the Nexus 7 is fast. It has not hiccupped even one time since I've had it. It reacts instantly with every selection. No crashes either.

Hands down, I'd take my Nexus 7 over any other tablet on the market."
B00DVFLJKQ,38,380,The second one I've had for five months now and I really like traveling with it instead of lugging my laptop,pb,5,Yes,26-Sep-14,-,0,"the first Nexus I got was defective...it wouldn't charge properly. The second one I've had for five months now and I really like traveling with it instead of lugging my laptop. I also use it with my google chromecast quite often and it is great to sit on the couch, watch netflix or youtube on the TV, and check my email."
B00DVFLJKQ,39,381,I love it.,KcMsterpce,5,Yes,31-Aug-13,2,0,"I bought the older Nexus 7 and was wildly impressed by its performance. After a few weeks I decided to donate that one to a family member so I could have my own newer model. Either one is great, and performs like a dream. The new screen on the ""FHD"" is gorgeous, battery life is great and I've had zero issues with it.
I waited quite a while for a six inch tablet. This is the closest I could get to that without going the smartphone route. I don't use my phone much, pay $11 a month and don't want to pay for a cell phone account. This still fits in a pocket, but it's a tight fit and I have loose fitting jeans.

For the price, it's insane how much you can get from this tablet. I highly recommend it. I can't understand anyone's justification for going the iPad Mini route when you can have twice the quality and performance at 1/3rd the price.
If you know you can get apps you need for Android, then just go with a tablet that isn't stamped with the ""Apple"" label. The only time I could't justify someone getting an iOS tablet is musicians, which have many apps for direct guitar plug-in, piano/keyboard and many other music-based effects that are hard to find (for now) on Android.
Otherwise, there's no reason to waste your money on something that just has a company's logo on it as proof of ""quality""."
B00DVFLJKQ,39,382,A fantastic tablet,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,07-Mar-14,1,0,"The Nexus 7 is a great tablet. Combine this with a keyboard and it is a great substitute for a laptop. The price was very good also. The tablet, overall, feels good, performs very well. It has a gripping surface. My OL's Toshiba tablet feels cheap. The only drawback is the lack of a memory slot."
B00DVFLJKQ,39,383,Freeze and Restart,andyoctober,1,Yes,25-Mar-16,1,1,"I too have had the freeze and restart problem. The solution? For some of the devices, there is no solution, and if the problem starts after warranty has expired you're just screwed."
B00DVFLJKQ,39,384,The best Android tablet out there,GaboPagan,4,Yes,09-Oct-14,-,0,"The best Android tablet out there. 4 stars in comparison to other Android tablets. Construction is fine, well finished. Durable. Good selection of apps. Wish The Omni Group would release their apps for the platform. Miss them.
If freezes every once in a while, scrolling is not too smooth. Even with those faults, its a good device."
B00DVFLJKQ,39,385,"Recommended, you will enjoy !",Julia or Brad Myers,4,Yes,15-Jan-14,-,0,"Have a 10"" Galaxy and love it but, this lets several users have accounts on it and switch back and forth with ease. Also, it turns out that it is a Great size to hold for gaming and best of all is the absolute Clarity and definition. Only draw back as with any electronics is the battery life could be a bit longer. This is a great tablet overall !"
B00DVFLJKQ,39,386,Great tablet,Justin S.,5,Yes,29-Jan-15,-,0,"I wish I had waited and purchased the Nexus 9 only because it came out a month later. The tablet is awesome and a great size. I love using real vanilla android. The price is right. Battery lasts a full day of almost constant use. Speaker is above average, Screen is bright (almost too bright when you have the brightness maxed out) and razor sharp. I wish Google made, or shall I say had made for them, more products like this."
B00DVFLJKQ,39,387,Four Stars,Jon B,4,Yes,21-Jul-17,1,0,Liked it a ton until I dropped it.
B00DVFLJKQ,39,388,"Not quite an IPad, but a great value",Morgan Paige,4,Yes,09-Jan-14,-,0,"I have both an IPad and this Nexus. The IPad screen was shattered, and I got the nexus as a back up. The nexus crashes a lot, and doesn't have quite the selection of good free apps that the IPAD has. However, I really like the size, it actually does fit into the inside pocket of my jacket. It is very portable and the screen is still big enough to watch netflix on. I love the fact that it is only half the price of the IPad, so I'm not quite so scared of breaking it."
B00DVFLJKQ,39,389,Great product for the price,Joseph Kong,5,Yes,12-Mar-14,-,0,"This is not your Samsung or Apple tablets, but I find it a perfect tablet for me.
The screen resolution is crystal clear, light and small (fits in my pocket, a little tight but it fits, of course I'm also 6ft tall so my pant pockets are bigger than average), and no performance issues with any of the applications that I like to run.
I wish it had a slightly better camera and an micro SD slot, but it's a small complaint when the price is half of the competition.
I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants a tablet for internet browsing, email checking, media streaming (through Chromecast as well), and mobile gaming. As long as the 7 in screen is not an issue for you.
For me, I found the benefits of the 7 in screen outweigh the cons: weighs much less and easier to carry around (in your pocket),"
B00DVFLJKQ,39,390,Still one of the best in 2015!,Josh S,5,Yes,27-Nov-15,1,0,"This is actually my second Nexus 7 (2013) the first ended up with a cracked screen from accidentally being rolled over by a office chair. After doing research to pick up a replacement everything seemed to point right back to this tablet and for good reason. The performance, display and compatibility are top tier for the price. For the next best tablet you are easily going to pay double what this costs. This is one of the greats in my opinion."
B00DVFLJKQ,40,391,Best tablet I have ever owned,Eugene S. Tiffany,5,Yes,19-Nov-14,1,0,"I am very happy with this purchase. This used device works excellently. I have a Vido Mini One tablet which also has a quad core and a high res screen and the Nexus 7 has shown itself to be a lot better, though the Mini One is a lot lighter and thiner and somewhat larger."
B00DVFLJKQ,40,392,We liked the Nexus 7 features and speed for the time ...,C. Pun,2,Yes,08-Feb-16,-,1,"We liked the Nexus 7 features and speed for the time we had it. But 5 days after the Warranty expired the unit will not boot at all.All data is lost and we are stuck with an expensive paper weight. If this is the quality of their products, we are not buying another one"
B00DVFLJKQ,40,393,GREAT GREAT TABLET,Baz,5,Yes,15-Aug-13,3,0,"Wow - I love this 7"" Tablet. The screen is stunningly clear and colorful. Playing 1080P is ridiculously smooth and clear.
WiFi is fast and consistent. The Android system is maturing very quickly and has become to me a better experience than I had with my iPad. I especially like that I can hook up a USB cable to my computer and quickly transfer videos, pix, and emulator games to it.
The new rear camera works quite well although the focus does tend to hunt quite a bit.
I really miss having a MicroSD slot though. Don't know why they still leave it out - maybe 'cause they want you to get used to their cloud service???
Speakers are much improved - stereo, louder, less tinny......
A lot thinner and noticeably lighter.
Miss the dimples on the back. Can get a little slippery depending how you hold it.
Fit and finish is very good. Looks and feels expensive.
Really good value compared to Apple stuff.
Can get Very very bright if needed!
Haven't tried the latest hi-res games yet but I'm sure I will be delighted."
B00DVFLJKQ,40,394,Cheaper than google,sam,5,Yes,25-Apr-14,1,0,"We bought this nexus 7 for about $25 cheaper than if we were to get it from Google Play store. It came just like it would from Google. (I got my first generation nexus 7 from google when it first came out). This device does everything we want it to. Granted, flash is an issue for some sites, but it's the software not the product.

The nexus 7 is light and easy to use. The screen is easy on the eyes when I use it at night and has no glare unless I'm right under the sun. To sum it up, if you want an amazing tablet for cheap, the Nexus 7 is the one to get."
B00DVFLJKQ,40,395,Not reliabe - get the Galaxy instead,Richard,2,Yes,15-Jan-15,-,0,I loved this tablet at first but after 12 months I'm getting persistent screen touch problems. Either the screen doesn't respond at all or the tablet takes my last touch and repeats it multiple times. Typically I have to close the app or restart the tablet. Never had this problem with my Samsung phone.. I wish I had got the Galaxy tablet.
B00DVFLJKQ,40,396,Very nice and fast tablet,H.N from Michigan,4,Yes,27-Mar-14,-,0,"The device asked to have software update immediate out of box. After the update the internet was very slow.Then, i contact asus customer services and got help. After that i have no problem at all. Overall, very nice portable tablet. I am testing to see how long this may last. I think i may buy 2nd as gift for my best friend! Thats how much i love this tablet!"
B00DVFLJKQ,40,397,A big improvement over the original Nexus 7,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,16-Jan-16,-,0,"This is sooooo much better than the first generation Nexus 7. I love the size and wish there were more options available. But, I am perfectly happy with this one. It is much faster than the older one and has 2 cameras that take nice pictures."
B00DVFLJKQ,40,398,Love it!,jkerns,5,Yes,17-Mar-14,-,0,This is my first tablet. All 4 of our kids have one but I just stuck with the computer and regular books but my husband bought me this for Valentines day and I absolutely love it! It can do anything a computer can do for the most part. I wish I would have gone with the bigger screen....that would be my only complaint but it's a great product!

I ended up purchasing one for my mom as well as a mother's day gift and even though she often struggles with technology, she was able to learn how to use this device very quickly!"
B00DVFLJKQ,40,400,"Great tablet, exceptional quality/price ratio",Juan UY,5,Yes,04-Mar-14,-,0,"Maybe I would rate it 4.5 if possible, because there are some minor things to improve. However, it is more a 5 stars than 4.

B00DVFLJKQ,41,401,Very nice Tablet,The_Godfreys,5,Yes,27-Apr-14,2,0,"This tablet is slick. Fast, nice size and shape. Will fit in a large pocket if necessary. Can't imagine a better looking screen.
Seems like a quality built unit for the money. i bought the Toshiba Excite at the same tinme for my grand daughter and although i am very happy with that for the price point, this is a much nicer unit."
B00DVFLJKQ,41,402,This table has worked perfectly for me for the last ...,Jmonty,5,Yes,25-Nov-16,-,0,"This table has worked perfectly for me for the last 13 months. It's been taken on numerous road trips, camping, to Europe a few times, as well as Korea.

For a budget tablet used mostly for streaming video it has been exactly what I expected."
B00DVFLJKQ,41,403,wish that I could be more helpful.,Michael,5,Yes,11-Mar-14,1,0,"There's tons of better reviews here that go into details. Things that I was especially surprised about after reading all of those reviews: the battery life is great. Takes a loooong time to charge. Touch screens not as responsive as I would like, but I think that's touch screens in general. Really quick. The screen is REALLY nice. Incredible resolution and contrast. Totally replaces a small laptop as something that I can throw in my backpack and read emails/surf the web around town. Totally realizing the cool stuff that I can do with this each day."
B00DVFLJKQ,41,404,Perfect fit for my wife and I,Josh,5,Yes,27-Aug-13,1,0,"We were looking for a compact tablet perfect for vacations! This tablet is everything we hoped for. Not too big..if you go 10"" might as well have a laptop IMHO. Great resolution, snappy processing. Light to hold.. All around great tablet for our needs. Google's new multiple profile interface allows my wife and I to seamlessly share the tablet. That being said we may be buying another in the near future!!"
B00DVFLJKQ,41,405,Love it!,ronno,5,Yes,13-Dec-13,-,0,"It's a Google product so it gets every update as soon as it comes out. No more waiting for the tablet manufacturer to get around to it (or not - like Toshiba and my Thrive doorstop, still running on 4.0.x). Only possible improvement I can think of would be a micro SD slot. But maybe my reader will work with the USB host cable I also bought."
B00DVFLJKQ,41,406,DOA tablet was on erasing display whwn i powered it ...,Sobe,1,Yes,27-Jul-17,-,0,DOA tablet was on erasing display whwn i powered it up and it stayed there for an hour. I kept rebooting but just stuck in that mode.
B00DVFLJKQ,41,407,"Anywhere there's WiFi, it's golden.",Nicholas,5,Yes,31-Jul-15,2,0,"It's a great handheld Linux computer. Paired with a bluetooth keyboard (and maybe bluetooth headphones) and VPN/RDP/VNC software, it's a perfect work-anywhere solution. The Snapdragon 600 holds its own, despite its age, in any application I've tried--game, productivity or video. If you've ever used a Nexus 5, it's the best analogue I can point to, just with a bigger screen (and no cellular service), despite the 600/800 difference in processor.

External batteries are helpful, but not strictly required. I get 4-6 hours of screen-on runtime with battery left. The biggest drawback is WiFi. Subscribing to Sprint, I didn't have LTE connectivity as an option to go with the LTE model (wrong bands), so I've looked at the hotspot service, a physical hotspot or hunting down an available service provider. It's the only real Achilles' Heel I can mention. I guess you can add the bezels if you really need a second weakness.

Put a glass screen protector and a solid case on it--kickstands are wonderful if you can secure one--and enjoy it. Lollipop 5.1.1 runs like it was designed for it. And if Google enables it for Fi, it becomes the Phablet to end all Phablets!"
B00DVFLJKQ,41,408,Many apps very usuful,jp,4,Yes,03-Apr-14,3,0,The first unit I received was defective had to send it back for replacement. The second I got has been working great. I am still learning how to use many of the apps. It has been working real good.
B00DVFLJKQ,41,409,Do not update if purchased,Timothy R Julian,1,Yes,10-Oct-15,-,2,"I received the nexus 7 2013 on October 8th. The device want to update from kitkat 4.0 to lollipop 5.0. Once updated the device would not connect to the WiFi. It appears that a lot of people have the same problem after updating. Google has not fixed the problem for some time now. I never got around to even using the nexus, very sad. Please don't purchase this product or stay on kitkat, but Google will keep nagging you to update to lollipop."
B00DVFLJKQ,41,410,STOPPED WORKING IN 4 MONTHS!,nlyrose,1,Yes,05-Dec-14,1,1,Do not buy from here. I bought this tablet in May 2014 and it stopped working in September 2014...4 MONTHS LATER!!! The tablet refuses to charge anymore. I tried other chargers and the tablet still refuses to charge. That's $250 down the drain. DO NOT BUY THIS TABLET FROM HERE.
B00DVFLJKQ,42,411,5 Stars,Tim W,5,Yes,07-Mar-14,1,0,"I absolutely love this product, it is fast, reliable and easy to use. I am using it now to write this review with a bluetooth keyboard. I can use it to write essays, play high intesity games and take good pictures. Setup cloud print, save your items to google drive and print them out on any printer you have set up. Battery last all day even while playing games. Save destination areas on your maps and use your gps to guide you without broadband. I have had it for 2 months now and no problems."
B00DVFLJKQ,42,412,Bricked after software update.,M. Gregory,1,Yes,07-Sep-15,6,1,"I got the tablet in the mail and booted it up for the first time. The UI looked nice and it ran smoothly. All was well until I got a notification to install the latest version of the Android OS. After the update, the tablet worked fine for about five minutes before freezing and rebooting - and then would not turn on at all. I followed all directions and the device was fully charged, but no longer functional. A web search revealed that the new Android OS update has been bricking Nexus 7 tablets left and right for months and Google is doing nothing about it. I'm in the process of getting a refund from Amazon and won't be buying another Google tablet. I'm not sure how well the tablet will work without the update, but buy at your own risk. I went with a Samsung tablet instead, and it works beautifully - even if it's a little slower than this model. I'd rather have a slightly slower tablet than a $200 paperweight. Never again, Google."
B00DVFLJKQ,42,413,Amazon doesn't provide support on Tablets they sell,Victor Jones,1,Yes,12-Jan-15,-,0,"Set up as a Holiday present with all of the accounts, network connectivity and e-mail accounts. Worked for a couple of days, and then failed to connect to the local house WiFi. Looked for a support number, but there was none. Checked the Web, and it sounds like a common problem. Talked about reflashing OS and possible Mother Board issues. Since there was not networking, no way to do anything with the device. No support channel for device, No real operating manual with information.

Returned device as broken. Learned my lesson the hare way that there is no support or way to get things fixed when buying through Amazon."
B00DVFLJKQ,42,414,Still The Best Performing Tablet For The Price,Jared - Mr Everything,5,Yes,15-Jan-15,1,0,"I've been using this tablet for the last 3 months and have been absolutely blown away from how reliable it is. In many ways it's replaced my quad core laptop and most of the time runs things more efficiently than my laptop can! There are many great reviews talking about this tablet so I won't go in-depth with what's already been said but I had a $500 Transformer Infinity tablet that was laggy, full of bugs, freezes, and would constantly restart itself regardless of what ROM I ran on it. I was very disappointed with ASUS and Android but after getting the Nexus 7 it ran every program and widget I ever tried on the Infinity all at once with no issues. It's never froze, crashed, or randomly restarted. Although a 10in tablet is great for YouTube and watching videos, for everything else (especially messaging) it's way too big while the Nexus 7 fits perfectly in the hand or in a pocket. The build quality looks nice but is cheap and plastic so I have a Poetic slim case on it which looks great and adds protection. Again the build quality is probably why some people have screen and battery issues, especially if it's been dropped without a case but as long as you take care of it as I have it runs better than many $500 tablets for less than half the price. The screen is super sharp, the stereo speakers are good although using good headphones with an EQ app is the way to go for the best experience. The biggest weak spot are the cameras which aren't that good but considering the previous Nexus 7 only had a front camera it is an improvement but I would like to see better cameras (8-10MP) in all tablets as I'm one of the few that does use tablets for their cameras, and again the Nexus 7's size doesn't make using it as a camera that odd. I've recently put Android Lollipop on it which runs great (5.0.1) and keeps this Nexus up to date along with the great internals which will keep this tablet relevant for years to come. If you don't have the money for the Nexus 9 or simply don't want a tablet that large the Nexus 7 is still a great performer, runs great, and with Lollipop still feels like it can hold its own among late 2014 tablets and probably even some tablets that we'll see in 2015."
B00DVFLJKQ,42,415,Best small tablet,Sumit,4,Yes,23-Dec-13,-,0,"First of all it is pure Android experience which you would not get on any plastic Samsung device. Great build quality, awesome screen resolution (I didn't notice any false color thing as some reviews on the net suggest). The thing I like most is how snappy it is every time I tap any application for example - Facebook which takes hell lot of time to load after login on my other android device even on my new HTC one, but this little guy loads it like boom.
Got it updated to 4.4 right when I got it and after couple of weeks to 4.4.2 so no wait for latest android updates here for me."
B00DVFLJKQ,42,416,Great multi-purpose tablet,Mike Hawkins,5,Yes,23-Jun-14,1,0,"I've used the Nexus phones before and loved them for their simplicity - just pure Android and nothing else. The tablets are the same. Great performance, incredible battery life and a beautiful display round out what I believe to be the best value on the market in the 7 inch range."
B00DVFLJKQ,42,417,Do NOT waste your money on this.,Silas Dogood,1,Yes,23-Aug-15,3,0,"This is a terrible product. I bought it because it was recommended by Project Gutenberg and I had never owned a tablet before. But even without comparing it to any other tablet, this is a terrible product. It crashes constantly, and I mean every time I try to turn it on. It is useless. Do not buy it. I paid over $200 for nothing."
B00DVFLJKQ,42,418,Looks like i have received a good one; huge improvement over the original model,S. Konrad,5,Yes,20-Oct-13,1,0,"At first, I was a little concerned after reading all the reports of problems people have with random reboots and touchscreen issues. But I seem to have received a good unit, no such problems. When comparing to the 2012 model, it's a huge improvement in almost any regard:
- The new screen is much better than the old one, brighter and better resolution. Also, the new screen doesn't flicker anymore at low brightness settings.
- Noticeable improvement in CPU speed. Qualcomm makes much better SOCs than nvidia, much snappier and no lag anymore. I can't emphasize how much more enjoyable this tablet is to use compared to the old one.
- Much improved storage speed, programs install much faster and finally no lag anymore during normal usage.
- Battery life is much better, lasts noticeably longer than the old model. The only quibble I have i have that the battery seems to drain a little faster when idle. Eg, 6% over night, even with WiFi, GPS, background data, etc. turned off. Maybe they will fix that in some software update.
- They fixed issue with light sensor reading being all over the place, making auto brightness more reliable.
- Lighter, nicer form factor, and sturdier feel.
- Stereo speakers are nice, max volume much better than previous model.
- The old model had the nasty habit of skipping music playback while e.g. surfing the web. New one also doesn't do this anymore.
- Headphone jack on top much more practical.

Overall, if you have the first generation Nexus 7 and any of the issues listed above bother you, don't hesitate to upgrade, you won't be disappointed."
B00DVFLJKQ,42,419,excellent upgrade.,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,01-Nov-15,-,0,"cant believe i went this long without upgrading....ugh. glad i did now. brighter screen than the original nexus 7. also, the speakers on this lil thing r amazing. dont really care about the cameras, someone else might though."

B00DVFLJKQ,43,421,Loved every moment with Nexus 7,Kanaka P. Byraju,5,Yes,21-Jan-14,-,0,"only negative comment i want to make it the build quality of the tablet. fell on floor and small part of corner got chipped off. device still works and the crack is not noticeable. Other than that excellent product and with clean android and 7inch form factor, rocking my day !! highly recommend this Feel free to ask any questions."
B00DVFLJKQ,43,422,Ridiculously fast!,Krystal Rae Olson,5,Yes,19-Feb-14,1,0,"I've only had the Nexus 7 32g 2nd Gen, for two days, but so far I am very impressed! It's extremely fast, the touch screen is super responsive, and the battery life seems excellent for a machine this powerful. My only reservation for buying it was the lack of an SD card slot. Hopefully by the 3rd Gen they will remedy this silly oversight. A flash for the rear facing camera would be a great addition as well."
B00DVFLJKQ,43,423,Five Stars,eph28,3,Yes,07-Dec-14,-,0,"I bought the pre-2013 Nexus 7, then this one. The micro USB port wore out within six months on both of them. Neither was abused. According to Wikipedia, the port is supposed to be much sturdier than the USB plug so the cheaper cord wears out first. The cord still works with other connectors. Otherwise it's just fine."
B00DVFLJKQ,43,424,It Just bricked up and I am not alone.....,Jack Meier,1,Yes,19-Apr-15,6,0,After owning for 20 mos hardware problems are now running like wildfire with this model. Mine bricked up last night. The units are bricking up in large numbers for this model. Google blames Asus and Asus is blaming Google updates. Neither is offering a solution. Please check the Nexus 7 forums on Google product forums for more info into what solutions if any are offered before buying. In the meantime my $270 tablet is now a brick. Until this problem I would have given it a 5 star. Now with it out of warranty and all the parties involved are sorry it seems like an expensive mistake. Be informed before clicking purchase
B00DVFLJKQ,43,425,Love it!,Kindle Customer,5,Yes,29-Apr-14,2,0,"I had a Asus TF300T and love it but with all I do I needed something with more ram. Being a Google girl and Asus fan, I went with the Nexus 7. It is all I wanted with the exception of expandable memory. Would recommend to any one!"
B00DVFLJKQ,43,426,I couldn't be happier! Even though Google has quit selling this unit ...,Johnny Mac,5,Yes,06-Dec-14,-,0,I was actually planning on the Nexus 9 but after reading the reviews decided on the slightly smaller form factor of the Nexus 7 v2013 for business usability purposes. I couldn't be happier! Even though Google has quit selling this unit it is available from Amazon for a yet a while.
B00DVFLJKQ,43,427,Highly recommended tablet!,Rob Watkins,5,Yes,19-May-17,-,0,"Excellent purchase! Tablet was reasonable, has lasted for a long time and given me virtually no trouble.Very happy with this purchase!"
B00DVFLJKQ,43,428,Awesome,Dr. Germ,5,Yes,31-Dec-15,-,0,"This is a great little (just the right size, actually) tablet. Especially with 32GB you can load it up with movies and music, and it will last for a long-haul flight. And it still gets Android OTA updates as of Jan 2016 (mine's running Marshmallow 6.0.1)."
B00DVFLJKQ,43,429,a better version well worth getting,R Zimmer,5,Yes,11-Sep-13,1,0,"i own the first nexus 7 32gb and it worked well with only a few minor problems. but the new nexus 7 is faster, more smooth operation. i am very pleased with the new nexus 7. i love the addition of the rear camera which works very well. the battery life is close to the 1st nexus 7. well worth getting. i wish they would ad a sd card reader, but not this time. hope they will do it in the future. i did notice a minor flaw, lets say you installed an app then decided you no longer wanted it. well noramally you would goto setting then apps then choose app to delete. but after doining this on the new nexus 7 2013 when you go back to the home screen most of the time the icon for that app is still there. when you click on that app it says that it is not there. so if you hold your finger down on that app icon till you can drag it to delete then this gets rid of that icon. now i have just tried to delete the app by holding finger on app icon then drag it to the delete and it is gone. but when i goto settings then apps it still lists it there, so i delete it there too. i hope there will be a minor fix for this soon. but it is something i can live with as i feel this is the best tablet out there to date. hope this helps you to decide to buy or not.

B00DVFLJKQ,43,430,What a difference between the display on the 2012 and ...,M. Alspach,5,Yes,01-Feb-15,-,0,"What a difference between the display on the 2012 and the 2013 models..

I can play XCom on this tablet, but cant on my 2012 model.
I can play most wanted on the 2012 model and not this one..

strange, but I prefer this model personally."
B00DVFLJKQ,44,431,The Nexus tablet filled a need for me,R. Michael Green,4,Yes,10-Apr-14,4,0,"I use an HP Envy 17 Notebook at home for most tasks. And, my Samsung Galaxy 4 is super for travel, etc. I need a wifi only tablet to use when I am downstairs from my office and when I am visiting with friends and family. After much research, The Nexus 7 seemed best for me. I like the coordination across platforms as I am a long time Google and Amazon cloud user. Calendars, email, updates are handled seemlessly. I do not watch movies on this or any other device...I like a big screen with big sound. The Nexus though is super for quick searches for dining, tickets, etc. The speak to search function works beautifully. I can keep up with my subscription items such as The Wall St Journal and local newspapers. The device is solid and has beautiful screens. The included on line manual is helpful."
B00DVFLJKQ,44,432,Quality/Price < 1,ZDF,1,Yes,13-Jun-14,-,0,"Pros:
Price. I like the larger screen and photo quality of IPad Mini, but there is a price.

Cons:
I don't like the location of the on/off/wakeup button. A front button would be nicer.
Battery life could be better.
Android seems unresponsive, sometimes (or is it a HW issue?).

*** UPDATE[2015/3/16] ***
One star and title changed ("">"" is now ""<""), for the touch-screen, finally, died and Asus refused to repair it under international warranty (although some people say they had no warranty problems with products bought in USA)."
B00DVFLJKQ,44,433,Better than my 4g phone,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,24-Mar-14,1,0,"I carry this everywhere. My training, browsing, reading, Amazon buying, Google voice calling, do everything tablet that fits in my pocket. I had a big 10"" tablet and it stayed on the charger because it was big and clunky. The Nexus is slim, fast, and does everything my PC can, although I still use the PC for programming."
B00DVFLJKQ,44,434,"mechanical design problems limit longevity, fixable, yet most believe them to be Android issues...",Amazon Customer,1,Yes,01-Mar-16,3,2,"At first I thought that this Google/ASUS Nexus 7 2013 tablet was great especially for the discounted price I paid about 18 months ago, $160 vs $300 MSRP... Problem #1... USB port charging, degraded, slowed, and failed permanently... Oops, my fault because I often used the tablet while charging. Even though I used a right angle connector cable, eventually this stressed the USB connector enough to fail... ASUS wants $90 for the small board to fix this... But, for $13 get Anker 'hockey puck' wireless Qii charger... This worked fine for several months (tip.. Use Velcro to secure correct positioning...) After a while, Qii charging became a problem... I opened the case to find inferior design and manufacturing techniques... For example, the USB connector is mounted about 1/16 in from the edge of the case, allowing for a pivoting and wiggling which will cause a line to break and fail... (Compare this construction to the USB connector on a top name cellphone and you'll see the connector set back from the case edge providing two point support, rather than a one point pivot) ... While removing the back cover incorrectly the first time, I caused the corner to actually rip a little... Uh oh, bad choice of plastic....! Too soft...probably dimensionally unstable... Looking around inside, one will notice the Qii charger coil on the inside of the cover relies on springy contacts to touch and complete charging circuit to battery on the main unit.. There's not a wired connection.. Combine that with inferior plastic material being too soft and flexible, add a bit of corrosion perhaps, and you have an intermittent contact... Oh boy... This is nowhere near $300 quality... Wait...! What's going on with all the tapes over the connectors and corresponding foam rubber spacers on the cover ...? They secure the tiny male/female connector pairs joining various board level components using tape to hold them and spacer pressure too... Time for research... Didn't take long to find YouTube's and Android forum entries addressing these shortcomings... Build up the spacers with cardboard and adhesive to restore pressure lost to failure of foam rubber compression. With tablet reassembled my Qii charger works fine with three 2-1/2 lb dumbell weights pressing onto the tablet ( screen face down on folded cloth, apply Qii, load with weights )... Problem #2... As for the mysterious screen freezes, boot up freezes, lock screen freezes, brick States, etc... believe it or not merely tapping on the back probably will get the tablet motivated... Or squeeze it hard on the USB end, and it may cure the freeze problem for a while... You need to keep in mind that the connectors inside are literally falling apart at all times after the warranty period ends... Do not call ASUS or Google about these problems, they don't know, they won't admit, they don't care about this P.O.S. However, you can learn to live with it... Indeed, you might consider picking one up for $100 as long as you can return for refund... Note that ASUS no longer manufactures Nexus....!"
B00DVFLJKQ,44,435,Good product for the price,Michele Johnson,4,Yes,30-Dec-14,-,0,"My daughter (13) got this for Christmas, it's a bit of a pain if you are used to the apple products

B00DVFLJKQ,44,436,Awesome product!,Daniel Park,5,Yes,31-Dec-13,-,0,"I work for a phone company and I've had the pleasure of trying all the tablets and by far i would have to say that the Nexus 7 takes the cake! Its ALOT faster than the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, It has better resolution than the iPad mini. For the price that your paying, you're getting SOOO much. It's such a steal. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! i watch netflix and get about 7-9 hours of motive time WITH the speakers! definitely one of my better investments!"
B00DVFLJKQ,44,437,I love my Nexus!,Robert J.,5,Yes,31-Dec-13,1,0,"This is my 2nd Nexus. I gave my 1st one to my wife to use as a reader.

I like everything about it. The size, the screen, the weight, the power, just all aspects of it.

B00DVFLJKQ,44,438,Not even worked one day.,Bala,1,Yes,07-Jul-14,2,1,"I have bought this new Nexus 7 2013 model on June 20 and not even one day. My friend was coming to India, since I ordered from India and once I got it I just used for two mins then it got stuck so powered off later it didn't switched on.
I contact Google they tried to resolve through call but it didn't workout then I gave to Ausus service center they told looks like issue in main board I asked them whether I can return it but since I got from US I can not return it and there is no procedure to return it.

So please do not buy it."

B00DVFLJKQ,44,440,I love the device itself,Shane Bradshaw,4,Yes,25-Sep-15,1,0,"I love the device itself; quick, excellent screen, and solid gps for a tablet.

B00DVFLJKQ,45,442,Amazing Android Tablet,Wilson Chicardo,5,Yes,05-Mar-14,-,0,I have been very bias when it comes to Android Tablets but this tablet totally blew me away with it's amazingly smooth and fast performance. Colors saturation is great and very comfortable to view for prolong hours. Battery life is good enough for a full day of excessive usage. Overall a great product.
B00DVFLJKQ,45,443,One Star,brayhan,1,Yes,28-Mar-15,5,0,"That worked for a year after that never work again, It's dead and the warranty is not longer available."
B00DVFLJKQ,45,444,Excellent little device.,Ben Aherne,4,Yes,28-Aug-13,1,0,"Delivered promptly with no issues so far.
Form factor and size is great for reading and browsing, a little clumsy for typing partly due to the sheer lack of bezel on the height of the device. The screen has a amazing colors and clarity, fonts are smooth with no steps at all and it's fast.
My fault with it is android, on which I have found browsing to be slow on any browser I've used, I don't find it particularly intuitive or attractive nor do I think it does much to take advantage of the screen. If you're already smitten with android this could well be a 5/5, especially for the price, for others it could be a hurdle to get over.
But for the cost, it has absolutely no competitor at any size,"
B00DVFLJKQ,45,445,Best tablet I have owned.,Eric T Larsen,5,Yes,29-Dec-14,-,0,"My first tablet and a love this thing! Was very easy to set up out of the box. Had to go through multiple updates to get to most recent build, but it was very easy. Battery life is decent, though it could be longer. Screen is crisp and great. I love this as a kindle reader as well and use it all the time."
B00DVFLJKQ,45,446,Excellent tablet,Michael B. Stanley,5,Yes,24-Jun-17,1,0,Great little tablet!
B00DVFLJKQ,45,447,Dead spot on touchscreen,melloh,2,Yes,08-Jan-16,-,2,"At about a year of ownership, the touch screen has a dead spot. I'm pretty sure it's out of warranty and I doubt it's worth replacing the screen. Disappointing....... I've been trying to avoid apple products, but this ain't helping. Also, battery life is mediocre."
B00DVFLJKQ,45,448,A powerful tool with amazingly crisp display,Flannery,5,Yes,13-Dec-14,-,0,"A die-hard Mac / iPad / iPhone user for years, I saw the YouTube review for the Nexus 7 by Marques Brownlee: http://youtu.be/wEpMtf6nJco.
He was right: the display on this little tablet is amazingly crisp, and the size of the tablet makes it easy to carry and hold.
I am impressed by how easy it was to make the switch from iOS to Android. I use the Nexus 7 mostly for Google Docs and mirroring with my Chromecast.
I am still a die-hard Apple user, but this little tablet holds its own, and you can't beat the price."
B00DVFLJKQ,45,449,Everything I hoped for.,SVTHOMAS,5,Yes,10-Nov-13,1,0,"This tablet is quick--much snappier than my nexus 10 and every bit as wonderful as my nexus 4. It runs preliminary builds (4.3 binaries) of android 4.4 AOSP amazingly well--impressively smooth and responsive. The touchscreen is working perfectly while running android 4.4 (also tested with a touchscreen test app to verify). I have not had one random reboot. Cannot wait to see how well the official Google 4.4 factory image performs when it is released.

Wireless works well and doesn't drop. I haven't had a chance to test Bluetooth. Screen is sharp and really bright-- a lot brighter than the screen on the nexus 10. Battery seems sufficient, I have used the tablet throughout the day for classes at college and the battery didn't require a recharge until late in the evening. Haven't tested the camera because the 4.3 camera binaries aren't working with 4.4. If I remember, I will update this review once an official 4.4 image is released for this tablet.

When running 4.3, I had no random reboots but the touchscreen responsiveness didn't as optimized as it is on 4.4. I wouldn't call it unusable (it was tolerable), but the difference was fairly noticeable after upgrading. However, I do feel they have finally gotten it dialed in with 4.4, at least on my unit. Overall I am happy with the purchase and do not regret it one bit."
B00DVFLJKQ,45,450,Really - Amazing tablet for the money ~,JaneMancini,5,Yes,13-Feb-14,1,0,"Many great reviews on here - which helped in my decision to buy this - so thank you to everyone who took the time to post their reviews.
I have owned a few Android tablets - a Motorola Xoom and an 7 inch HTC.
I also have an iPad 1 and 3, an iPad Air, and an iPad mini - and I like those quite a bit.
I enjoy ios and Android - probably Android a bit more at this point.

This tablet is AMAZING and an incredible deal IMO.
It is super fast - and the display is beautiful.
I have only had it a few days - but it does everything I need.
It would be a huge home run if it had a SD slot to boot - but not a big deal really.
I loaded plenty of apps, some music and 3 movies - and have plenty of storage space left (32GB model).

It is very comfortable in hand - and feels solid.
I don't use cases - and I prefer the ""grippy"" type backing on these compared to Apple's metal back.
The only gripe I have is very minor -
With tablets getting pretty thin - I'm not a fan of the curved power and volume buttons,
I wish they would be squared off and/or level - again, very minor gripe since many apps have volume control on screen (music and movies).
Highly recommended, and the best Android tablet I have used. Very happy with my purchase."
B00DVFLJKQ,46,451,Excelent,Rozaylith Rodriguez,5,Yes,26-Dec-13,-,0,"No doubt some is the best tablet I could buy in that price range, performance is flawless applications, aesthetically beautiful, impressive quality images that provide useful display, super fast and easy updates, good sound and camera normally, the only thing I see that I could improve would be the expansion of memory but is something that I took at cosideration to buy it and I do not regret at all, in fact I'm thinking of buying another."
B00DVFLJKQ,46,452,GPS receiver works nicely at altitudes up to 12500 feet (at least) and ...,Dmitry,5,Yes,01-Oct-15,1,0,I am using it as my VFR flight navigator. GPS receiver works nicely at altitudes up to 12500 feet (at least) and it lasts with screen lit and Avare app on for 11 hours without charging!
B00DVFLJKQ,46,453,I am in love with my tablet,Lydia Kirton,5,Yes,01-Nov-14,-,0,"I am in love with my tablet. I was reluctant to get one because I felt all I need is a simple cell phone and my desk top at home. But now after using the tablet I carry it wherever I am going, and it helps me pass the time while I am waiting for meeting to begin or in an office etc. It is an excellent purchase."
B00DVFLJKQ,46,454,Screen is very high HD and overall product form factor a big +,Terence,5,Yes,22-Apr-14,1,0,"I had the old Nexus 7 which I purchased a couple years ago. Thanks to an overly enthusiastic friend, it was broken, never to be used again.

Decided to purchase the new Nexus 7. The screen resolution blows me away.

Other than that, no problems. Highly satisfied!"
B00DVFLJKQ,46,455,Gift for my husband.,Judy,5,Yes,08-Jun-14,-,0,"I never got around to ordering this for a Christmas present. When husband opened it for Valentine's Day, he said he didn't think he would use it much so he was glad he didn't get it for Christmas.

He barely sets it down! And uses it exclusively as his e-reader.

Fast moving from app to app or around the web. Fantastic resolution as well."
B00DVFLJKQ,46,456,"Excellent resolution ""retina display"" for sure!",Underserving Favor,5,Yes,28-Apr-14,2,0,"Check out the PPI (pixel per inch) for various tablets and you will find that this tablet is a worthy competitor for the ipad Retina Display series. I switched from ipad (generation 1 and 2) to Nexus 7 and do not regret it.
One thing is that the Android tablet has so many (for my use is junk) features and apps, that it comes with default, but I remove these from the home screen to make it look cleaner.
Use it mostly for email, browsing and as a scheduler."
B00DVFLJKQ,46,457,Lets you play Candy Crush on the toilet!,Jason H,5,Yes,09-Jun-14,1,0,"I have a HP Candy Crush player on my desk that is too big to take to the john. I have a Droid Maxx Candy Crush machine that is useful when I am traveling but has a much smaller screen. Fact, the Nexus 7 Candy Crush machine is the perfect size for the bathroom."
B00DVFLJKQ,46,458,"Best bang for the buck, hands down!",tr0ntr0n21,5,Yes,13-Nov-13,2,0,"I have had an iPhone since they came out in 2007 but I've never bit the bullet and purchased an iPad. It seemed stupid to pay all that money for something I wouldn't use very often. I ended up getting a Vizio tablet a couple of years ago and it was a total POS. I got it from woot so I wasn't able to return in. I had been waiting on the new iPad mini w/ retina but there was still no date set and a friend at work had this Nexus 7 tablet and I really liked it. I wanted something bigger than my iPhone that I could use to play Candy Crush, watch movies, check Facebook, etc. I got some help from a friend and installed Cyanogenmod on it and it's a very powerful inexpensive tablet. I'm very happy with it and it's even had me considering going to the dark side and ditching my iPhone 5. I still think the iPad / iPhone is the best product if you want something simple that just works. I would never recommend the Nexus tablet for my mom or dad, but if you are moderately technical, this is the best bang for the buck."
B00DVFLJKQ,46,459,Big thumbs-up for Nexus 7!!!,Ashley Honecker,5,Yes,17-Sep-14,-,0,"The Nexus 7 is a perfect tablet for both the casual and hard-core nerd. This was my first tablet and, after careful consideration, I finally settled on it due to it's superb resolution and high-end specifications. Set-up was quick and easy and, nearly four months later, I have yet to experience any issue."
B00DVFLJKQ,46,460,Handy and nice size,C. VanDaele,5,Yes,18-May-14,1,0,I take this with me everywhere. I have several books on it if I need to pass some time waiting for an appointment or something. I use the calculator frequently. It fits in my purse. I watch Netflix on it and the picture quality is great.
B00DVFLJKQ,47,461,It was cool but Apple trounces all,Lil Uzi Vert,4,Yes,03-Apr-18,-,0,I never really used it that much. It was cool but Apple trounces all.
B00DVFLJKQ,47,462,The perfect tablet plus a Perfect hot iron,Ajith Memana,5,Yes,04-Apr-14,3,0,"It works great and looks too good. I think i need not explain much.
Only negative i can say is that due to its slim form factor, it heats up much even while playing simple small games. At around 35 degrees weather outside here, it takes a little long for the tablet to cool down or dissipate heat. The end result is it reaches around 60-70 degrees easily with moderate game play. In colder weather conditions this wont be an issue at all. It live in a relatively hotter weather. So i must complain."
B00DVFLJKQ,47,463,Great Tablet,CajunRican,5,Yes,28-Sep-14,-,0,"Got this one for my daughter and she loves it. The screen is awesome. We own iPhones, iPods, and a retina display iPad so I was a little hesitant on getting a non apple tablet but I am glad we did. You cannot beat the price of this 32GB system. It is absolutely gorgeous. Double the memory of my wife's iPad and my girl can download tons of apps. Way to go Nexus 7!"
B00DVFLJKQ,47,464,Crystal clear display,Luminescence,5,Yes,26-Apr-14,2,0,"The display is very clear and sharp. The battery lasts well. Being so light, my children takes them to practice Math or read books on road trips, at swim races, etc. all the time. Handy little device."
B00DVFLJKQ,47,465,I love it,Brandon,5,Yes,12-Mar-14,-,0,"I love this tablet you can print from it, take notes,play games, watch movies and more. I use Google music so I don't have to worry about music problems. I had a galaxy tab 3 which was pretty nice but it froze a lot. Ive done a lot of research on it before buying; was scared but so far its the best. No problems what so ever only cons are that it doesn't have an SD card port and the camera is moderate. But, its light fast and perfect in any environment, school,work or home."
B00DVFLJKQ,47,466,Clear and Bright!,usmcdad,5,Yes,13-Mar-14,-,0,"We love our Nexus 7 from Google. My wife and I both already had the Google Nexus 4 smart phones, so were familiar with the interface. Since we loved our Nexus 4's we were sure we would love the Nexus Tablet. Make sure you get the latest version, as it is more powerful than the original."
B00DVFLJKQ,47,467,Nexus 7,Steven L. Hayes,4,Yes,05-Jun-14,-,0,"I really like it but the sweet spot for me is probably one that is the size of the coming Nexus 8. I have a Galaxy 3 and 7"" is not that much bigger and it is not as easy to read books as it is on an Ipad.

However, you can carry it in a pants pocket and this flexibility is great."
B00DVFLJKQ,47,468,Simply said my favorite tablet and best Android tablet ever,iLoveTech,5,Yes,15-Nov-13,4,0,"I owned all kinds of tablets; iOS, Android and Win8 with different sizes starting from early sluggish 8"" Android tablets including 9.7"" iPad 1 and iPad 3 and 10.1"" Asus Transformer Android tablet and even an 11.6"" Lenovo Windows 8 tablet.
The Nexus 7 2013 is by far my favorite tablet that I keep using all day and everywhere.
Size: 7"" is the real sweet spot that is small enough, light enough and yet still confortable for reading
Performance: having the best Snapdragon processor in any Android phone or tablet until November 2013 you can expect a great speed and response either in games, browsing or photo processing Apps
Display: with a full HD 1920x1080 resolution colors are realistic, photos are vivid and screen details are very clear which make it a great device for reading books or news
I should also point out that I bought from Amazon as well the Poetic slim cover which is very slim and light and perfectly protects the device and its screen."
B00DVFLJKQ,47,469,awesome,W. W. Ingalls,5,Yes,15-Dec-13,-,0,This tablet is awesome. My husband said he was getting it for me to use in my classroom so that I could video tape lessons but so far he is using it every day in place of his blackberry. That's ok... I am letting him break it in and then teach me all the shortcuts to getting those perfect pictures and videos.
B00DVFLJKQ,47,470,Very happy with this purchase,Lily,5,Yes,11-Apr-16,1,0,My son loves his android tablet. It has alot of memory for apps. Very happy with this purchase.
B00DVFLJKQ,48,471,good,Another opinion,3,Yes,21-Oct-15,-,1,At first I was disappointed in the lack of contrast and depth of videos compared to my Kindle Fire HD. But I am used to it now and I much prefer being able to use Chrome and having a connection to wi-fi that is stable.
B00DVFLJKQ,48,472,I actually love using this tablet,Mari,3,Yes,26-Mar-14,1,1,"I actually love using this tablet, but unfortunately I have had to send it in for repairs 2 separate times because the device won't charge. The first time I sent it in it wouldn't charge at all. They said they repaired it and sent it back. I just sent it in again because it would only charge to 35% (and that took 2 days!). Anyways, I love the tablet when it is actually working, but I am going on a month and a half without it due to continued need for repairs. I'll give this tablet another shot, but I am beginning to think I should have paid more and got an IPad."
B00DVFLJKQ,48,473,"RIP, great tablet",Amazon Customer,5,Yes,06-May-16,-,0,"This was a great tablet while it lasted, wish new ones were this inexpensive. Unfortunately, time and newer android OS versions, along with Google not using Asus any more, bricked it."
B00DVFLJKQ,48,474,"Google Nexus 7 Tablet (7-Inch, 32GB, Black) by ASUS (201",Ingrid,5,Yes,27-Feb-14,1,0,"So far it is very good, fast and reliable. It had problems picking up Bluetooth Jambox but finally did. Had the previous Nexus 7 and was very happy with that one also but this 2013 model is superior. I have always liked Google; it delivers."
B00DVFLJKQ,48,475,Tablet is great and exactly what I expected,Joshua Paprocki,4,Yes,28-Sep-14,-,0,Tablet is great and exactly what I expected. I unfortunately didnt have it long. I bought a refurb unit that I think may of had the screen replaced. I have the older Nexus 7 model and had dropped that thing more times then I can count. But the new refurb I ordered had the screen shatter after dropping it once. I can only assume it wast repaired with a less then perfect screen. So just a buyers beware if your like me and always buy refurb sometimes it might not be worth the small amount of savings.
B00DVFLJKQ,48,476,I really love this thing.,Kerri Stone,5,Yes,21-Feb-14,1,0,Just awesome. Unlocked and rooted very easy. Playing games like mc4 and dead trigger 2 are so much more enjoyable than using my phone. I lucked out and got sent a mobile version when i paid for the WiFi only but that aside it's a bargain you will be very happy you got one.
B00DVFLJKQ,48,477,Disappointed with the software,Fernando,3,Yes,27-Aug-13,1,0,"When I bought the Nexus 7 I was afraid that the hardware was not going to last very long. I've had many droid phones and even rooted a Kindle with android and aways found the software to be robust. But with the Nexus everything seems to be flipped. The hardware is quite impressive, with a beautiful display, thin and light body. Feels very solid and I've had no issues with scratching even though I had it without a case for a few days. The software, on the other side, has been a huge disappointment. A few days into using the Nexus it started to do random reboots. Then it got stuck on the startup screen for about a week, until I figured a trick to make it work again. Now once in a while it reboots without any reason. I'm keeping it on just because I'm afraid if I turn it off it will never turn on again. I'm not sure what Google did to Android 4.3 because the previous versions work great on my other devices. Again, very disappointed with the software. I also wish the Nexus would have more accessories. It seems that it takes forever for manufacturers to offer accessories specifically designed for the Nexus 7."
B00DVFLJKQ,48,478,Great price,Justin Chan,5,Yes,19-Feb-14,1,0,"my used-acceptable condition nexus 7 had two scratches on the display but these would be hidden pretty easily with the application of a screen protector. Works pretty fast but I miss having a home button. Great size, highly recommend getting a case with a stand."
B00DVFLJKQ,48,479,Amazing product,Scottsman,5,Yes,25-Dec-13,-,0,"This tablet has been great. I use it most for getting my news online and reading books through the Kindle app. The battery lasts a very long time and it transitions between apps very quickly. For my use (not much into downloading movies and tons of music), the 32GB worth of storage is more than ample."
B00DVFLJKQ,48,480,Best tablet I have used.,GROWE,5,Yes,25-Mar-14,-,0,I've had multiple iPads as well as an original Moto Xoom (which I still adore) but this tablet blows them all away. The resolution is gorgeous and the processor is very snappy moving from app to app even with several apps open. Excellent choice and I'm interested to see where the Nexus line goes next.
B00DVFLJKQ,49,481,For my roommate,Richard,5,Yes,26-Apr-14,2,0,Every time I see my roommate she has the Nexus 7 in her hand doing something with it and she really likes it. She bought it to take to Japan and she is happy with it. I however am the one who suggested it.
B00DVFLJKQ,49,482,worth it,LeveeJohn,5,Yes,03-Jan-14,-,0,"Don't listen to all the picky reviewers. It's really fast and the quality of an iPad. As far as dropping I don't know... But very impressed. Ideal for something to do when you're bored, email, or browsing the web while laying down. it's also a fairly large screen. Some apps don't work... No biggy though, there are tons to choose from. I'm thrilled"
B00DVFLJKQ,49,483,awesome tab,Loeyd,5,Yes,05-Apr-15,1,0,Love my nexus. I'm an owner of a nexus 5 and wanted a tablet and decided on the 7. Comes with no bloatware I also know that most developers like using nexus products to develop apps
B00DVFLJKQ,49,484,I am so glad that I chose the Nexus 7,Kevin Green,5,Yes,28-Jul-14,-,0,"The reason that I bought this was that I previously had a Nook HD and was having problems with the battery. Given the fact that Barnes and Noble does not have a decent solution for this systemic issue (a lot of people are experiencing the same issue), I decided to trash the Nook HD and get something to replace it. I am so glad that I chose the Nexus 7. The size and shape are superb, the battery life is more than acceptable (I may be skewed by what I just experienced), and the speed is much better than that experienced with the Nook HD. I am so happy with this product that I am replacing my laptop for professional planning purposes with the Nexus."
B00DVFLJKQ,49,485,I LOVE this tablet!,G. Edwards,5,Yes,20-Jan-14,-,0,"I've had this tablet since Christmas and haven't had a single problem. I love the way it fits in my hand, and when I need to do any typing of any substance (like this review), I simply pair it with my Logitech keyboard and I'm good to go. This is my 3rd tablet so far (not counting the Galaxy Note, which I am still kicking myself over for selling), and it is definitely the best."
B00DVFLJKQ,49,486,good overall but not great....but very reasonable price,Tan Khoon Giap,4,Yes,03-Jan-14,-,0,"I upgraded from a 2012 Samsung galaxy 10.1 inch to the nexus 2013, did not feel much different.
But I have to be fair because of the price I paid for Nexus is much lesser than Samsung galaxy 10.1.
Very light weight compare to 10.1, 1 big reason why I bought Nexus.
Nexus screen was less vivid then samsung and personally, nexus screen brightness could not go low enough for use at night.
Battery life around 6~8 hrs of game play, below expectation. And maybe due to Android 4.2 software, some apps can't be install.
The power socket could be better, slightly difficult to find under low light.
Buttons location could be better, feels like I will damage them in under a year."
B00DVFLJKQ,49,487,Just a great tablet. The display looks great,Burnside Bob,5,Yes,26-Feb-15,-,0,"Just a great tablet. The display looks great, battery life is excellent and it does everything I need to do with no hassles. And it's so cheap for the performance. This tablet is making me look at the Nexus6 for my next phone possibly."
B00DVFLJKQ,49,488,Best tablet around.,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,10-Sep-13,2,0,"This device is the cream of the crop. The best display, the newest incarnation of the android operating system, excellent sound, excellent touchscreen, the best processor for a really really really good and affordable price. I love it. I recommending it above any other."
B00DVFLJKQ,49,489,"If You Are Torn About Which Tablet to Buy, This Is A Sure Winner",John M. Palamaro,5,Yes,11-Jul-14,-,0,"This is a fantastic product. It's inexpensive, intuitive to use, and size-wise, just right. I cannot think of any improvement for this product, but make sure you purchase the Poetic Slimline Case for the Nexus 7, 2nd Gen, as it controls on/off and protects this fine product."
B00DVFLJKQ,49,490,What an awesome Tablet,Jakis,5,Yes,05-Mar-14,-,0,"This tablet is beautiful, if you are looking for great portability that a 7"" tablet provides then this is the one to get, I have been impressed with all the features and the amazing clarity. I did a lot of research before deciding on this tablet and I was not disappointed"
B00DVFLJKQ,50,491,Perfect gift.,rom,5,Yes,04-Apr-14,3,0,Brought it for my dad. He already has an iPad 3 32GB. But he wanted something more sleeker to carry around. but bigger so he can read. This solves the purpose.
B00DVFLJKQ,50,492,Nice little tablet,Stinny,4,Yes,24-Mar-14,-,1,"So far this has been a great little tablet. It is quick and responsive. I have been able to run every app that I've installed with no problem, and the graphic intensive apps have had no problem running on the Nexus 7.

My only complaint is that there doesn't seem to be too many quality cases out there for it. I was hoping Otterbox would have made a case."
B00DVFLJKQ,50,493,Still a Great Tablet! Very Fast with Lollipop Update!,SauceyBiscuit,4,Yes,21-Feb-15,-,0,"Decently happy with my purchase from Ocean Reef! I received my 2nd gen Nexus 7 (32gb) from them 2 days ago and have experienced 1 issue so far, the generic 2-port AC adapter which came with the Nexus 7 (not original) from Ocean Reef, overheated my device and would not power on for about 15 mins! This is surprising to me, but I realize I should probably buy the official charger from Asus to keep this problem from happening. Well getting back to it, first off the price had me sold, it was unbeatable and couldn't find it anywhere else for the money and Ocean Reef as a company had great reviews here on Amazon! As far as I can tell, there are only slight visual marks and scratches on the screen and very few of them at that! As soon as I turned it on I installed the Lollipop 5.0.2 update, which is a massive overhaul for Android and definitely makes the tablet more enjoyable to use!
This isn't my first 2nd gen Nexus 7, I really enjoy trying out different tablets from Samsung, Apple, Dell, Asus, Kindle, etc, you name the good ones and I've most likely tried them out (just a side hobby and learning curve). I'm a big fan of the Nexus line of tablets and am yet to try the Nexus 9, but for right now I really enjoy using the 2nd gen Nexus 7, 32gb, its just enough screen for short emails, movies on-the-go in HD, mobile gaming (Modern Combat, Dead Trigger, etc.) and writing reviews such as this one! It's quite inexpensive now as well, due to other tablets coming out with better specs and hardware, not to say that this doesn't do its justice, with 2gb of RAM, 1920x1080p resolution, a 1.5 GHZ Qualcomm processor, 9+ hours of battery and the latest, greatest Lollipop update, this is still considered (in my book) to be a great, fast and helpful tablet!
I am pretty happy with my purchase of this Nexus 7 (2nd gen, 32gb) through Ocean Reef, the shipping was free and it came within 3 days of purchasing it! Again the only issue is the bad generic AC adapter it came with, I'm probably better off not using it (Giving it a 4-star rating)! Otherwise I look forward to getting the most out of my Nexus 7 2nd generation! Thanks!"
B00DVFLJKQ,50,494,This tablet is AWFUL!,Layla,1,Yes,09-Jan-14,-,0,"It works great, until the time you have to return it expires. Now, I'm making payments on a piece of crap that won't charge, the micro usb port is shot, when I manage to get it charged, the battery lasts 1 minute, and the tablet cuts out on me. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE! I want a refund!"
B00DVFLJKQ,50,495,AWESOME,Maid Marian,5,Yes,27-May-14,1,0,"My husband and I really love this Nexus 7 from Google, we both use it for different reasons, my husband loves the apps and I love it for my social media. The video and sound is clear and fast, really recommend it."
B00DVFLJKQ,50,496,"Awesome little tablet, works like a charm",Kyle Stinnett,5,Yes,03-Mar-14,-,0,"I love the Android ecosystem. I had a larger 10"" tablet that didn't survive my last deployment. I saw the new Nexus and knew I needed to have it. It does everything I need it to and a little tweaking it I got it to load off a SD card and now I have all my movies on a small package"
B00DVFLJKQ,50,497,Impressed!,Angela W.,5,Yes,09-Dec-13,4,0,"For me, this is a great 'household' tablet. My husband, my daughter and I all have a profile set up on the tablet which only we can access with our unique password. There is a ton of memory to allow for many, many apps. The clarity of the display is outstanding! I watched a TV show on Netflix, and a movie on Amazon Prime - both worked without any issues, and the picture was crisp and clear. We also have an iPad Mini, but find this Google Tablet much easier to navigate - and appreciate that there aren't a bunch of pre-loaded, useless apps on it. I am VERY impressed with the Nexus 7 tablet! For $249, I got a 7 inch screen with remarkable display and super high resolution, 32GB of memory/storage, and an easy-to-share system between household members. I would highly recommend!"
B00DVFLJKQ,50,498,Nexus 7,Adit,4,Yes,28-Jun-14,-,0,"On the whole, I like this tablet. The size is right for me and it is very portable. The screen is incredibly sharp with great colors. The only complaint I have is that the screen is sometimes unresponsive to my fingers, especially if they are very dry."
B00DVFLJKQ,50,499,Almost Perfect,William Howe,5,Yes,29-Oct-13,4,0,"This is a review for the Nexus 7 32GB wifi only tablet.

So I gave had this tablet now for close to 3 months and can now give some feedback. It was not looking too good for the Nexus 7 when the first device I got from Amazon stopped accepting a charge 6 days after I received it. However, as usual Amazon was amazing with their customer service and even sent me a new one before I had sent back the defective model. The replacement Nexus 7 has never had a problem so I understand every product has a few defective units made and my first Nexus 7 just happened to be one of those few so I will not hold this against Google.

Pros:

The whole tactical experience of the Nexus 7 is just amazing. This device just feels ""right"" when you are holding it. It fits perfectly in my hand, has nice rounded corners and very sensible soft rubber back (I really wish Apple would use soft rubber backs as they do not scratch and the tend to stay in place better on things like your car dashboard).

The screen is just incredible compared to the iPad Mini (which I own as well - although to be honest I have not used the iPad Mini in over month since this tablet has replaced the iPad Mini as my everyday tablet). The resolution is perfect and you would be hard pressed to find a valid criticism of the screen.

The battery life is pretty impressive. Now I do not use this tablet to watch very many videos so my battery life might not be indicative of everyone's but I can go a solid 2 days sometimes 3 days before it needs to be charged. And the charger it comes with seems to be a rapid charger as it fully charges in under 3 hours which is much better then either my iPad or Ipad Mini.

This tablet seems to me to be very fast. So I am not a techy who benchmarks performance, but from personal observation it is seems much faster then the iPad Mini when playing games.

This tablet is just incredibly light and it makes it very easy to always bring it along. It weighs practically nothing and as a result I find myself never leaving the tablet behind and I bring it with me everywhere.

Google Now is simply the perfect electronic assistant. Yes, I know Google Now is available on iPhone, but the iPhone version does not have the full functionality of the Android version and Google Now has become essential to my everyday life.

The cost of the 32GB version was $270. This is half the cost of the iPad Mini and it is a better device in my opinion. I don't know how they could be making money on this tablet at that price point, but that is Google's problem. As a consumer, I love the super low price.

Negatives:

It required a couple updates right when turned on and I would expect this to have zero updates out of the box.

The Android ecosystem of apps is the Wild West and hence you are likely to get several apps that are adware or malicious. I highly suggest the first app that you download be Lookout as it screens apps that might have these characteristics.

No SD card slot. Adding an SD card slot to the Nexus 7 would seem to be a no brainer, but alas they have not added one.

Conclusion:

This tablet has blown me away. I mostly bought it out of curiosity, but it has become my go to tablet for everyday use. I think it is perfect for browser the Internet and playing games. However, if you are heavy video watcher on tablets you might want to make sure the screen is big enough for you to enjoy watching videos. I cannot recommend this tablet enough - they hit a home run with this device and still it costs half the price of the next best ""mini"" tablet . Buy with confidence."
B00DVFLJKQ,50,500,What tablets should be,A. Lopes,5,Yes,28-Aug-13,2,0,"With its superb screen, very good (but not-top notch) specs, and a form-factor that makes it very comfortable to hold it on your hand. This is definitely what a small form-factor tablet should be and it is significantly better than the original Nexus 7, which I also own.

I have found the performance very satisfactory, loading web pages quickly and displaying videos without hiccups. It is also good to know that Google has optimized the code so performance does not degrade over time, as it did with the old Nexus 7. Battery performance is OK, not very different from the old Nexus 7 in my view, probably because the screen demands more power.

I am also very partial to the ""pure"" Android experience without skins, like you find in Samsung and HTC devices. That allows me to have the latest versions of the OS, as soon as they are released by Google. That means Google Now and all the other goodies that come as part of Android, without interference from manufacturers, carriers, etc."
B00DVFLJKQ,51,501,Google and Asus produce a beautiful love-child,Bigslew,5,Yes,13-Aug-13,1,0,"This little tablet is fast, the display is clear and crisp, and it's super light to hold. I love the way it feels in my hands and I can't stop looking into its dazzling face. My girlfriend is getting jealous!

I wanted a retina iPad mini and was going to wait until the fall of 2013... but then the Nexus7 came along. The price along with the seamless Google-Android experience makes this a neat little piece of tech that's very easy to use and FUN to play with. It fits well into the Google ecosystem of apps and features. I now use it as my nightly reading device (books, magazines, blogs) instead of my Kindle.

I wish there were more apps that took advantage of the HD display. Some icons and games look blurry. The camera is also less than desirable, but as others have noted it's not designed to be a camera. But Skype and Hangouts work just fine.

Lastly, have we finally arrived at the point where a dedicated bathroom tablet is the norm? I ask why not? This could be that device! Buy several! One for every room! Velcro them to your walls, your couch, your nightstand!"
B00DVFLJKQ,51,502,Perfect Tablet,Jim T,5,Yes,23-Nov-13,1,0,"This is a great mid-sized tablet with plenty of punch. I've had a 10"" Motorola Xoom since it came out and needed another tablet so my wife could cook and I could study at the same time. The size, weight, screen, battery life and overall performance are exactly what I wanted. The Nexus 7 is about 1/3 smaller, 1/3 the weight and 1/3 the price of my Xoom. I just got an OTA update to Android 4.4 as well!"
B00DVFLJKQ,51,503,"It was great, except",Belmonticus,2,Yes,03-Sep-14,2,1,"I returned it. It was great, except.....the volume was way too low, and no way to increase it. If it weren't for the low volume, I would have kept it."
B00DVFLJKQ,51,504,i barely used it maybe like 4 hours a week at most,Ilya P.,1,Yes,20-Sep-14,-,1,"the tablet died completely after 10 month. i barely used it maybe like 4 hours a week at most. was always used indoors, never abused, never got warm or hot, never dropped. just a pos tablet. now im gonna have to go through Asus horrible warranty service."
B00DVFLJKQ,51,505,Works great,mwofpioneer,4,Yes,05-May-14,1,0,Good tablet. Still getting used to the screen size. This is my first tablet and I'm still getting used to the screen size. It works great for accessing the internet and my e-mail and read a book now and then while I'm away from home.
B00DVFLJKQ,51,506,SUPER but charging ports wear out fairly quick (approx. a year),Donna,4,Yes,05-Oct-15,-,1,"love it, just wish they would make the charging port better so the ports don't wear out so quickly & lasted longer period of time That is the only reason I had to replace my other Nexus 7 with a new Nexus 7"
B00DVFLJKQ,51,507,Excellent tablet for the price,Mickey,5,Yes,03-Jan-14,-,0,"Although, I've had this tablet less than a month & I'm still in the learning process, I have yet to find anything to complain about. When I run into a situation that I'm unclear about, I go to the downloaded manual & figure it out. It is a different experience than a computer, but I guess that's what makes it fun. The front & rear cameras take excellent pics & are easy to operate. The speakers are very good for a piece of ""tech"" this small. The battery seems to be very good with charges, so far, lasting 8 to 10 hrs. In a nutshell, I'm quite satisfied with this tablet."
B00DVFLJKQ,51,508,Fast and very nice screen,VickyT,5,Yes,11-Feb-14,1,0,"I purchased this tablet for short business trips and I have had a very good experience with it. The processor is fast and the screen is neat with the best resolution. Until now, I haven't found any trouble with this tablet."
B00DVFLJKQ,51,509,Nice size but bad battery life.,Tim,4,Yes,09-Sep-13,1,1,"This is my first 7"" tablet and I do like the compact feel, compared to a full size iPad. Android does take some getting use to if moving from iOS though. My biggest complaint about the tablet is battery life. I get about a day and a half, then it's dead and that's if I don't even turn it on. I keep bluetooth off, only wifi is on. My older iPad can go a week or longer, so it's quite an adjustment. I have to keep the charger close by most times."
B00DVFLJKQ,51,510,This has staying power.,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,03-Dec-15,-,0,"Even though this is a 2013 product, it's still great. The OS was rather current (KitKat), and quickly updated all the way to Marshmallow. I'm very pleased with the purchase."
B00DVFLJKQ,52,511,"The 7"" size is great. It is so responsive and everything works just ...",M. Wendel,5,Yes,19-Oct-14,-,0,"This replaced my original Samsung GalaxyTab 10.1. Wow.... Having the latest version of android and a lightning fast processor makes all the difference. The 7"" size is great. It is so responsive and everything works just great."
B00DVFLJKQ,52,512,Great portable device,Texas T,5,Yes,27-Aug-15,-,0,"My pre-teen son bought this with his saved money instead of a laptop. He has used it quite a lot. It is a good device. Responsive, good battery life, tough (he's dropped it several times), etc. Would recommend."
B00DVFLJKQ,52,513,Great tablet,sunshine5,5,Yes,22-May-14,-,0,I researched and reviewed a lot of tablets before purchasing this one. It is fast and has a very nice screen and resolution. I'm impressed by its storage capacity and sound. We got a great deal on it and it was a great gift which I also enjoy using.
B00DVFLJKQ,52,514,"The tablet alone ... AWESOME ... one ding for accessories, no IR blaster",Eric Spencer,4,Yes,29-Aug-13,1,0,"Responsiveness, check
Battery life, check (2-3 days depending on use)
Frequent OS updates, check (at time of writing have already received one)
Display, great for my needs (bed + bathroom reading, YouTube, Netflix viewer)

Noticeably missing:
Dock + charging accessory (exists for old Nexus)
IR blaster ... (exists on old Nexus)
Flash for camera ... not that big of a deal for my use of the device, but noticable

For the price, I really love the device ... it is the tablet I've been waiting for."
B00DVFLJKQ,52,515,My 1st Tablet,JonP,4,Yes,18-Feb-14,1,0,"I have a desktop pc, a laptop and also a smart phone so I wanted a tablet. I did my research and refused to pay the price of an Apple iPad. I am completely satisfied with this tablets features and operation and highly recommend it."
B00DVFLJKQ,52,516,Great tablet,P. Federici,5,Yes,27-Jan-14,2,0,"I bought this is a gift and they love it! Its fast, and no bloatware, just vanilla android and the perfect size. Plus the battery lasts a long time and build good tough build quality."
B00DVFLJKQ,52,517,great,Zina,5,Yes,22-Feb-14,1,0,"I like the Android version, because I don't need any windows functions, therefore I have a laptop. This device is easy to manage and it goes with all google features. I suggest to have a gmail or google email adress."
B00DVFLJKQ,52,518,Nexus 7 tablet,Ed Freytag,4,Yes,24-Jan-14,-,0,I like the form factor and the high resolution screen. The touch sensitivity is hit or miss specially when using an internet browser. It's annoying to have to hit the screen multiple times to get something to happen. Wish it had a micro SD card slot for additional memory and an SD slot for direct transfer of pictures. The screen is WAY too reflective but the resolution is great for pictures and for reading. For the price it beats a Mini Ipad.
B00DVFLJKQ,52,519,so glad I did!,MZ,2,Yes,01-Dec-13,3,0,"I've been eyeing this tablet since before it came out... I've hesitated because of bad reviews but my lap top broke so I needed a replacement. I got it on sale at Staples when the 32gb was $219 and I knew I wouldn't find a better deal so I bought it and couldnt be happier! I've had it a little over a week now and it works really well. The 7 inch screen is a great size, I thought it would be too small but it so easy to hold and I can still watch my shows. I've tested out the GPS and made sure no dead pixels. if u are looking for something portable and fast don't hesitate.. This tablet is great!

Update
The tablet is awesome BUT my screen cracksd twice in a short amount of time. Both times it cracked it was just sitting there,one time on the couch other time on the charger. I have 2 other tablets that have survived much more abuse from my 2 year old. Tablet is great but the screen wont last"
B00DVFLJKQ,52,520,Awesome Tablet!,knn,5,Yes,21-Dec-13,1,0,"It does all of my tasks quickly as expected. Pages and pictures are sharp and clear. The stereo sound is great also. I watch movies on it. It fits in to my pocket, even with the TPU cover I purchased on it. I would recommend this tablet to all who want a smaller Android based unit."
B00DVFLJKQ,53,521,Just what I wanted,Jason R. Pisani,5,Yes,13-Jun-14,-,0,"It fits in my pocket. It was the lease expensive tablet I could find. The resolution is great! My friend has an older version (2012 I think) that is not as good as mine. The resolution, size, and buttons are better. I'm still getting used to the operating system. (I'm an IpHONE user). The slide to type is good, but I can't edit inside a word to delete one letter. Ex: ""Lettter"" I can't get rid of a ""t"". It fits in my pocket!! - you can't underrate that."
B00DVFLJKQ,53,522,First tablet and I love it!,A. Harrelle,5,Yes,27-Mar-14,1,0,"I was totally reluctant to the whole 'tablet' thing, but I am so glad I got this! It's so convenient for traveling. This tablet was highly recommended by my boyfriend's techie brother, and after one month of use, I have zero complaints. If you're in the market for a tablet, I would absolutely recommend this one."
B00DVFLJKQ,53,523,Lovely while it lasted,magintob,4,Yes,27-Nov-16,-,0,Loved it and was thrilled with it. Then soon after one year of use it just died in my arms. No tech repair could revive it for me so all easy lost. So disappointed. I replaced it with a Samsung Galaxy tab S2 which is also a dream to have and has out lasted the Nexus.
B00DVFLJKQ,53,524,Great tablet at a great price (before the newer models jumped sky-high).,Tim,5,Yes,06-Oct-15,-,0,"Does everything I need it to at a terrific price. Crystal clear screen. The last generation before the price skyrocketed. Have not had a single problem with mine, and I use it every day."
B00DVFLJKQ,53,525,Wash your hands before using it:),Pavel Fyodorov,4,Yes,21-Jul-14,2,0,"Sometimes, usually at kitchen (sounds funny, uh?), I feel like the sensitivity of the screen is low and the screen itself is not so responsive. Never had any problem of this type with original Nexus 7."
B00DVFLJKQ,53,526,Nexus 7 Glitch,Dano,3,Yes,09-Sep-13,-,0,"When I first used this tablet, it was good. But when I turned on the sound, it started to lock up. I couldn't press any of the apps and it was very slow. So I returned it and got the second one. When I signed on with my google account on my 2nd Nexus, it synchronized with the 1st Nexus & it started to have the same problem. I contacted customer service and I was shown how to reboot the tablet thus erasing all of my data, gallery and apps. The tablet now works fine. This should be looked into for the glitch when turning on the sound of the Nexus 7."
B00DVFLJKQ,53,527,Great tablet and great price,Carlton,5,Yes,24-May-14,-,0,"I love this tablet so far. Only had it for a few weeks, but it serves its purpose well. My 22-month old baby uses it primarily for her apps and to watch things like SuperWhy on YouTube and she never has problems with the tablet.

I wish the sound button was in a better spot (it's kind of tucked away on the side), but that's not a huge issue. Wanted an iPad but this price was the reason I made this decision."
B00DVFLJKQ,53,528,Twice is nice.,andyt,5,Yes,06-May-15,-,0,"This is my second one of these...the first got fried when an electrician was doing some work on my house and I had it charging. I thought about getting the new Samsung model, but it was over $100 more and maybe only marginally better. My first one worked great, so I chose not to tempt fate and went with the tried and true."
B00DVFLJKQ,53,529,absolutely in love,R. Peck,5,Yes,31-May-14,1,1,"I've had this device nearly a year, and it still works great. It goes everywhere with me. I store nearly all of my textbooks I need for college. Takes up minimal space and charges quickly. I love it."
B00DVFLJKQ,53,530,"Gaming, Work, and Everything Else",Just X,5,Yes,26-Apr-14,2,0,"I had the old Nexus 7, rooted and modded, and it was awesome, but 16 gb is just a bit too small for all the apps I wanted. The 2nd gen Nexus 7 is thinner, sleeker, has better hardware, a decent camera on the back, and best of all, twice the storage.

I play Dead Trigger, check my e-mail, browse, watch netflix, stream Pandora, and I don't have to be picky about which apps to keep. It's perfect!"
B00DVFLJKQ,54,531,Awesome Product.. Awesome service...,Digvijay Anand,5,Yes,23-Jun-14,-,0,"First of all.. Nexus 7 rocks.. Performance is staggering.. B'ful HD screen..quite light..best for Reading and carrying around.
No lags ..no glitches. This is the best of Android one can get.

Secondly, Amazon rocks even more. I ordered this from its US website and promised time was 10 working days.. but I got the same in 7 working days.. So that was delightful in addition to the fact that I got it Rs 3000 cheaper( $50) than what I was getting in India.

So all in all a 5 Star experience for sure. :)"
B00DVFLJKQ,54,532,loving this little tablet,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,14-Jan-14,-,0,"After reviewing most of the 7 inch tablets out there, I decided on this one because of its size, specs and of course bang for your buck. The tablet works great so far, no complaints. Automatic upgrade to kitkat straight out the box. very good battery life."
B00DVFLJKQ,54,533,Love Nexus 7 2013!!,Trip lover,5,Yes,18-Oct-14,-,0,Had a 2012 Nexus 7 because I like to game a lot. Needed a new one after 2 1/2 years. This one is extremely fast and it's wonderful for games and everything! I have already been sent the update announcement from Google and downloaded the 4.4 KitKat. It's important to have a great company behind the product too.
B00DVFLJKQ,54,534,To the seller,ahmed,4,Yes,25-Feb-16,-,0,Hello. I bought from your account by the period is not far off tablet device Nexus 7. and suddenly and after the use of good and device was excellent stop work two days ago. I took the machine technician near me. and after detection on the device told me that there is a malfunction or defect in the Motherboard. for this I you type this message for you to find a solution to me. So what should I do. Thank you and Wish you a happy day
B00DVFLJKQ,54,535,Great,Aguileo Gonzalez,4,Yes,17-Aug-16,-,0,"I still use this. Not as much anymore, but if you want a stock Android tablet I can highly recommend this one."
B00DVFLJKQ,54,536,Love my Nexus 7.,Joseph P. Devincentis,5,Yes,17-Sep-15,-,0,"Great tablet, fast, beautiful screen, nothing not to like about it.
Have toted it around for maybe 2 years now, looks and works like new, stock android from google is the way to go.
One of ASUS's better efforts."
B00DVFLJKQ,54,537,Great for traveling,Agnes,5,Yes,05-Feb-14,-,0,"I received my Nexus 7 from my children for Christmas. I love it. I have more to learn on it, but I'm def making progress:-) The resolution is great!! This is the crime da le crème of I pads. We got the best price on Amazon. I would suggest the Nexus 7 for anyone."
B00DVFLJKQ,54,538,Excellent product Quick delivery 100%,Javier,5,Yes,15-Mar-17,-,0,"Excellent product
Quick delivery
100% recommended"
B00DVFLJKQ,54,539,Great Upgrade,Nick M,5,Yes,25-Nov-14,2,0,"Great upgrade from the 2012 nexus, twice as fast and no lag issues. Only problem I've had is a few dead pixels."
B00DVFLJKQ,54,540,It does a good job for my purpose,John R Becker,4,Yes,21-Aug-14,1,0,This is a replacement for my original Nexus 7. I use it primarily to listen to audio books since have a vision problem. The original one had a problem with the earbud connection. It does a good job for my purpose. Asus has made printing smoother on this model and improved the battery life.
B00DVFLJKQ,55,541,Great screen and quick response without any of the stuff ...,Lunchcopter,5,Yes,02-Dec-14,-,0,I wasn't expecting this to be nearly has handy as it has been for work. Great screen and quick response without any of the stuff that I usually am forced to keep without rooting on other tablets. I'd highly recommend it.
B00DVFLJKQ,55,542,"The best 7"" android tablet",the thrifty Geek,5,Yes,17-Feb-14,1,0,"Asus delivers again. I handle and use many many different tablets from nearly every main line manufacturer is; Sony, Samsung, Toshiba act. (I do not consider the kindel by Amazon although it is a worthy competitor. The kindel is intended to be an e reader exclusively for use in the Amazon environment.) And the Nexus 7 made by Asus is the very best. Super sharp resolution, powerful processor and high quality fit and finish."
B00DVFLJKQ,55,543,I love my Nexus 7,Richard,5,Yes,18-Jan-16,-,0,"I love my Nexus 7. It's the perfect size, and is still a very powerful tablet for the money. When I broke my first one, I bought another."
B00DVFLJKQ,55,544,"Excellent ""like new"" purchase",Terry Cunningham Jr.,5,Yes,18-Apr-15,2,0,"I bought this tablet in ""like new"" condition and it is totally awesome."
B00DVFLJKQ,55,545,Buy this if your looking for a great tablet!,Michael,5,Yes,18-Mar-14,-,0,If your looking for a great tablet but don't want to break the bank or give a kidney for an iPad. Then this is for you. The screen is great the sound is what you expect from a tablet but can be improved with a nice set of head phones. Camera is orbit who buys a tablet based off the camera anyways? If you are in to custom rooms then you already know you can't beat a Nexus for development.
B00DVFLJKQ,55,546,Forget the iPad,Eric Gagnon,5,Yes,18-Feb-14,2,0,"If you are looking for an affordable option to the over priced iPad, that works just as well, here you go!
There are so many options when it comes to apps, free or pay, that there is no real competition.
My wife was skeptical at first, being in IT I wanted this so bad.

I think my Wife likes it better than I do!

I worried that 7 inch would be too small, but this works great takes fantastic pictures and is everything I expected and more."
B00DVFLJKQ,55,547,Sleek Nexus does almost everything,Tim Paul,5,Yes,07-Sep-13,1,0,"Quick and complete, this Nexus is everything I expected from an Asus/Google product.
The only problem I have is with the Android 4.3 software, which with programs like MLB.TV, won't live stream games. While this may be MLB's issue, you'd hope that these guys could collaborate a little more closely."
B00DVFLJKQ,55,548,"Still going strong over a year later, and I ...",Tr,5,Yes,08-Feb-15,1,0,"Still going strong over a year later, and I was one of the first to receive the Android 5.0 update. People constantly ask me what it is. Solid tablet."
B00DVFLJKQ,55,549,Very pleased!,Ash,5,Yes,27-Aug-13,-,0,"I am very happy with this purchase. It performs well for how I use it, which is mostly apps and browsing the internet. The few videos I have watched on it have an excellent display and sound. I like the size and weight of it - I think it feels very sturdy.
I would recommend it for anyone looking for a device that allows them to browse the internet and use apps on something larger than a smartphone, yet something smaller and more convenient than a laptop."
B00DVFLJKQ,55,550,"Great screen, smooth operation",J. Ossevoort,5,Yes,28-Aug-13,1,0,"For the things I use it for, it easily matches my experiences with my iPad with a retina screen. The form factor definitely makes it a great fit (it fits in my jeans' pocket) and the high resolution really allows me to view all content even when zoomed out.
It is the first Android based device that I've used that doesn't stall all the time. My Galaxy S3 (i9300) is terrible when switching between applications all the time, but with the Nexus 7 it's a breeze.
And finally, I really love the calendar app, it beats the one from iOS for quickly glancing through my appointments."
B00DVFLJKQ,56,551,"""DON'T SETTLE""",Grayard,5,Yes,27-Apr-19,-,0,"What can I say that Chinese owner hasn't already said?
""Don't SETTLE"""
B00DVFLJKQ,56,552,Just like new,Emiliorate,5,Yes,15-Oct-18,-,0,I was looking to replace my Nexus which had a broken screen. This is perfect. Works just like new!
B00DVFLJKQ,56,553,easily acesses available wireless networks,L. Schopf,5,Yes,03-Jul-14,-,0,it's light. fast. portable. easily acesses available wireless networks. great way to get online when you need to. i don't have a smart phone & don't want to carry my laptop everywhere. this is exactly what i need.
B00DVFLJKQ,56,554,The reviews out there touting the Nexus 7 as the best budget tablet are spot on in my opinion,jkm74,5,Yes,01-Jan-15,-,0,Money well spent on this device. There are cheaper android tabs out there but I'd be skeptical of those because I just don't think you'll get the same quality as you do with the Nexus 7. The reviews out there touting the Nexus 7 as the best budget tablet are spot on in my opinion.
B00DVFLJKQ,56,555,Mediocre user interface and terrible documentation,Winter,2,Yes,19-Jun-14,-,1,"I have been using computers for more than 30 years and done software development and large scale IT implementations for thousands of users as well as Web implementations for millions of users and the Google interface is remarkable in how badly it was done. If you need to do a reset or change a setting I find that I have to go look for a youtube video as the online documentation provided by Google is so lacking.

This extends to the touch screen where the touch point is sometimes indicated and sometimes not. When it is not provided it becomes a trial and error process to determine what movement in what location will work. This is far inferior to the iPad user interface and operating system and application. Once again one has to pay double and buy an Apple product (and put up with their stupid iTunes file management process) to get a small device that works properly and in a nearly intuitive manner.

Sad that the people at Google did not bother to hire UI people for their development efforts. The lack of talent and experience in this area is glaringly obvious."
B00DVFLJKQ,56,556,Beautiful Display,sliq,5,Yes,15-Jan-14,-,0,"Loving this tablet, I wasn't sure if I should buy this or it's 10 inch big brother but after using it, I'm glad I did. The display is beautiful, smaller yes, but beautiful. Movies and images are sharp, colors rich, and the device is just so fast. Games are fast, right now I'm enjoying asphalt 8, which is beautiful and fast on this tablet. One reason I'm glad I went with this instead of it's big bro, is because it fits nicely in my pocket. Another is it sips the battery in standby, which it was in for 3 days and used less than 15% of the battery's juice."
B00DVFLJKQ,56,557,I love my tablet is comfortable to take to classes,Mgallo,5,Yes,14-Apr-15,-,0,I love my tablet is comfortable to take to classes. the screen it might be too small for certain thing but in general great. Notice! google drive does not work 100% in this table for some reason.
B00DVFLJKQ,56,558,Died after a few days. Junk!,Sharp One,1,Yes,27-Dec-14,-,0,"What a piece of junk. Went dead in five days. I am sending it back. Please - don't take my word for it. Read the horror stories in Google Forums. search for:

B00DVFLJKQ,56,559,A worthy successor to the 2012 model,Will Ginn,5,Yes,26-Jan-15,-,0,"Have the Nexus 7 (2012) model that I use for a clock radio. Wanted to get this model while I could with the screen update and faster processor. Love the 7"" size of both tablets. A worthwhile successor."
B00DVFLJKQ,56,560,Not a scratch or dent on it,ravjr,5,Yes,05-Mar-15,-,0,Well worth the price I paid for a refurbished electronic device. Can't tell the difference except for the box it came in. I would definitely by from this seller without hesitation!
B00DVFLJKQ,57,561,Great tablet,MichiganRKV,5,Yes,19-Sep-14,-,0,Works great and the display is outstanding! Very convenient to hold in one hand. It would be nice if there was an app supplied with it that would be a detailed manual on how to use it and its many (not obvious) features.
B00DVFLJKQ,57,562,The best android tablet,Weslei,5,Yes,29-Aug-14,-,0,"Before this I had the previous model (2012) and I was happy with it. But I'm even more satisfied with this. Everything on this model is better. The display, ram, cpu, etc.

Pt-br
Antes desse eu tinha o modelo 2012 e estava feliz comele. Mas o 2013 me deixou mais satisfeito ainda. Tudo nele é melhor: cpu, memoria, tela."
B00DVFLJKQ,57,563,"Dead Pixels and Backlight bleed, Asus QC is lacking.",D Ngo,2,Yes,28-Aug-13,5,1,"So, after exchanging one device for this one currently (those keeping count that's 2), both have 1-2 dead pixels, the first was where the key 'W' was when the keyboard would appear, this 2nd device now has one dead middle.

It's annoying more than 'damaged' but after 2 devices, you'd think there'd be ONE out there with no dead pixel.

It looks like a common problem via Google search.

I could gamble for a third one, but that's another 2-3 days without a eReader + surf machine.

Definitely love the device though, just wish ASUS' QC would improve with their screen resolution."
B00DVFLJKQ,57,564,Great Product - perfect size,Michael A. Dickson,5,Yes,17-May-14,1,0,"I did a lot of research before I purchased the Nexus 7 table. I wanted a tablet that I could take on the road to look at, sort, and manage photos when my laptop was not available. I also needed an ereader. This table does it all. I have hooked it up to a 32 GB flash drive and a card reader with an OTG cable and everything works perfectly. Love this table and highly recommend it."
B00DVFLJKQ,57,565,Nice Gift,Sarah Davis,5,Yes,22-Jan-14,-,0,"I bought this tablet for my husband. He does a lot of reading, all online or pdf. This tablet is wonderful as a reading device. It's also great for games; the view is pristine and screen response is very fast. We're very happy with it overall."
B00DVFLJKQ,57,566,Best tablet deal anywhere,Jeffrey M. Welch,5,Yes,11-Apr-14,1,0,"Lets start by saying that I love the Nexus concept, I use a Nexus 4 phone, and have helped several people purchase and setup Nexus devices. So I am sold on the concept. To give you the short version if you don't already know, Google works with various manufacturers to create ""pure Google"" experience devices in the Nexus program. In the case of phones they sell these at what seems like close to cost with no-contract (one of the main reasons I like them).

I have used both the 2012 and 2013 version of this product. I feel like the price is totally reasonable and really an amazing value for what you get. The big improvement here is more power, more memory, but most noticeable a much improved screen. The first screen was great, but this one is brighter and crisper.

If you are looking for great bang for your buck in a tablet, this is your tablet. You will not be disappointed."
B00DVFLJKQ,57,567,meets expectations,djohn76,4,Yes,31-May-14,-,0,"Nice size, nice response time. If you are looking for a tablet that has vivid colors and fast response time, I searched and tried many before choosing this Nexus 7 second gen tablet and I would highly recommend it for work and play."
B00DVFLJKQ,57,568,Nice tablet,Cliente de Amazon,5,Yes,13-Dec-13,2,0,"Excellent tablet, I'm so excited with it, and it has excellent amount of space to install all the applications I want, nice resolution, and it is a very fast table."
B00DVFLJKQ,57,569,This is a great tablet and does everything I could want it to,C. Dolezal,5,Yes,22-Aug-15,-,0,"This is a great tablet and does everything I could want it to. I use it mainly as an e-reader, but it's nice to have internet and games on the same device."
B00DVFLJKQ,57,570,Works solid and great for security professionals.,mikeandgiah,5,Yes,15-Nov-14,-,0,"I use it for network pentesting. I installed PwnPad from Pwnie Express on it, and it works great!

Increased my skillset, my toolset, and my hourly price.

It's pretty solid!"
B00DVFLJKQ,58,571,Love it,Mike Heinrich,5,Yes,26-Nov-13,2,0,Received this unit today and while I was happy with the first generation Nexus 7 This one is so much nicer. easy to use and i'm no expert. Would recommend it highly
B00DVFLJKQ,58,572,Stopped working after two weeks,Brett Slaski,3,Yes,29-Aug-13,2,0,"This was my first tablet I have owned. After a week I was getting used to it and learning more about the O.S. I liked the unit and it served my browsing and reading purposes pretty well. I purchased an app or two and tried a few games and the performance was smooth. At about the two week mark I powered on the unit and it sat there with the Nexus ""N"" on the screen. I called Google who provided good support but unfortunately could not figure out why it wouldn't boot. The conclusion? Return it to the manufacture. I couldn't believe. Since the unit was two weeks old, I set up an RMA through Amazon and returned it and opted for a refund. I am tired of cheap consumer grade electronics breaking. I am glad this happened before a year, which is my usual experience."
B00DVFLJKQ,58,573,Kudos!,Thiago Dora Rocha,5,Yes,13-Dec-13,2,0,"I' ve been using for a week and so far this little thing makes everything easier.
I cant even notice I got something in my backpack.
All apps start and run really fast.
Built with good material. Looks beautiful.
Go for it if you want a small good price mini tablet!"
B00DVFLJKQ,58,574,Great tablet,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,25-Nov-13,2,0,"One of the best tablets on the market at great price. Very fast, beautiful screen. I wished it had SD card but considering the features vs cost you can't ask for much more."

good battery
good screen
easy to use
fast.

only drawback is the lack of Amazon Prime video. Amazon only has Prime video's or iOS or their Android tablet (the Kindle)"
B00DVFLJKQ,58,577,AWEsome!,becky,5,Yes,31-Dec-13,-,0,this is a great gadget. I got it for my husband and we are both obsessed with it. it is super easy to use and I know there are so many more options that can be used with this thing that we haven't even discovered yet. Really great device!
B00DVFLJKQ,58,578,Great! Well worth it.,MarkR,5,Yes,07-Jun-16,-,0,"This was a gift, and she continues to be thrilled with it. Great performer, great size, just everything seems to work well."
B00DVFLJKQ,58,579,Great product and value,Harvey,5,Yes,01-Nov-15,-,0,"Great product and value. What else can I say. A quality and excellent tablet from Google. With Amazon as a supplier, that's an extra plus. If you desire an android instead of an Apple system, I believe this is the best out there. Try it for size, assuming a larger screen is a not a must for you.
Pocket the difference with this pocket friendly form factor."
B00DVFLJKQ,58,580,DELIRIOUSLY HAPPY!,Mariska P.,5,Yes,08-Jul-14,-,0,"I originally wrote a very bad review and gave it one star out of extreme frustration. I edited that review to this. I also contacted the seller and I was not that pleasant. The seller wrote back in awesome time and I could have gotten things sorted out but now there is no need to. What had happened was I had called my isp twice yesterday and everything was online except for my tablet. I thought it was because of the date and time on the tablet which was wrong. When my isp couldn't help me get that online, and after googling, and after going into my computer to see if something was blocking access for the Nexus, I was ready to throw it out the window. I'm sure other people have been in my position with being frustrated over technology, but I thought I was doing everything to get the thing online. Today, it still wasn't online so I went into my router settings, which my isp should have about when they told me to reset my modem last night. I saw that it had firewall enabled and then when I went to another page and saw the pppoe username and pw (can't remember right now if that's the correct label, but I'm lucky I can even write this after wasting a whole day with the isp and on my own trying to fix things when I'm no expert. lol) and saw it was not what was supposed to be there. I corrected that and then VOILA! Nexus was doing EXACTLY what I had watched on youtube and displayed BRILLIANT colors and, not to be too dramatic..lol.. LIGHTENING fast speed! I even got my hola unblocker on there and was watching coronation street on the british itv player using hola unblocker. I took a couple of pictures and I am impressed. I'm not an expert in camera but I loved the quality of my pics. I installed some apps, but still trying to figure out how to get adobe flash on there, despite the directions I had seen posted in various forums. Nexus is lightweight, and it's easy to handle. I have rheumatoid arthritis, so my manual dexterity is a bit slipshod at the best of times. I'm charging it right now even though I wanted to continue to explore on it. I bought a Poetic slim casing for it.. actually I made the mistake of buying two, but I'll keep the spare one in case, because I did see reviews somewhere saying they will get damaged at some point. Not sure if that will happen with me though, I will wait and see. Oh and I watched WWE Main Event this morning as well and it was better than watching it on my tv through my computer. I can't see anything wrong with the graphics at all. I'm totally impressed with this gizmo and now I'm spoiled. I'm sure I'll be fighting with my husband to watch things on it. I should have ordered a slimport at the same time, but I can still do that. I'm also totally impressed with the quick response and the patience the seller had with me and highly recommend them. I would DEFINITELY recommend Nexus 7 2nd generation to a first time tablet user such as myself, but hopefully they will be less insane than I was when I was trying to get online with it. lol..."
B00DVFLJKQ,59,581,Terrible Touchscreen...so disappointed.,THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE,1,Yes,27-Nov-15,-,0,"I really wanted to love this tablet, but the touchscreen is terrible. It would consistently miss touches and the screen had dead spots, especially while angled up in a case. Asus should be ashamed and Amazon should pull this piece of crap. It made this tablet unusable."
B00DVFLJKQ,59,582,Just one day stopped working and there is no even a way to replace the item - as returns on amazon were accepted only for 1y,Olenka,3,Yes,02-Nov-14,-,0,"This is amazing amazon purchase, I don't want to tell you about the features. You can just read it on Asus site or other sites and compare devices. It is not that user friendly at the beginning as my ipad, and it took me a while. This is for androids lover with amazing multitasking, very flexible jelly bean:). It has good features, awesome speeds I used lots of adobe readers aplications there, modified, signed, worked amazing on pictures modifications..No freezing, no frustrations and no battery dying fast. Just amazing, like asus notebooks. My ipad has a broken screen and has so much wear on a back and this thing still looks like new even i used them in the same way.. And i am comparing with regular ipad 3, not mini. Mini ipad is a real waste of money - go with smart staff like asus for good speeds and good experience for the money paid! i will contnue buyng products from asus! Everything that i had was great!

It was good for less then 2 years and just stopped working, I bought it here on Amazon and seller is Amazon LLc they had limited warranty only i giess only for a year! Next time turchasing from a seller so that they can take full responsibility. Usially i loved amazon, but not with more expensive staff that needs warranty."
B00DVFLJKQ,59,583,Great tablet and great drivers,Scott P,5,Yes,13-Jan-15,-,0,"Truly a great tablet experience. I gave it to my folks and they only use it occasionally, but it is pretty smooth. Now loaded with Android 5.0 Lollipop and still fine. (the upgrade went fine)"
B00DVFLJKQ,59,584,Highly recommend..,Taguas,5,Yes,24-Dec-14,1,0,Dont go by its size.. This is a powerhouse.. Processor is lightning fast.. Graphics is high quality.. since getting this tablet I reduced my pc usage by 90%..this thing does most of the tasks now.. Battery life is decent.. Supports for a full day with a single full charge if you don't play high end games and videos throughtout the day... Highly recommend..

I thin it is defective and would like to get it exchanged but don't think according to policy it is possible. My funds are not such as to buy another one and feel cheated.
B00DVFLJKQ,59,586,much better than the previous version,bsantang,5,Yes,24-Aug-14,-,0,"Much, much better than the previous version. Very bright, crisp screen and processor is very fast. I use it all the time as a tablet and for my books and music. Easy to slip in a bag and carry on a plane."
B00DVFLJKQ,59,587,very cool,Joe Glines,5,Yes,29-Dec-13,-,0,"This works great, is easy to set up, and is loads of fun. Android has so many free & educational games it is amazing.

Also tying it togetehr with Chromecast (and cheapcast) alllows you to stream media to it from your computer."

B00DVFLJKQ,60,591,happy with my purchase,chad1,5,Yes,11-Feb-14,-,0,I bought this after much debate wether it was a good deal or not. I am a avid user of tablets and computers and was really impressed with the performance. I feel that it is a great tablet and would recommend this to anyone looking for something that is easy to carry and has a good performance
B00DVFLJKQ,60,592,great tablet,Kevin Barnett,5,Yes,29-Nov-14,1,0,"I specifically got this for my kids to use. Great for the price long battery, nice screen, loud volume, and good wifi range. Would buy again."
B00DVFLJKQ,60,593,I love this tablet,Robert E. Carter,5,Yes,05-Aug-14,2,1,"I love this tablet. I rarely use my laptop anymore. Perfect size for ease of use. My only minor complaint is the android system doesn't allow flash. Actually that's an Adobe problem, not android. Screen is crystal clear. Kit-kat is great. The processor is super fast. Great experience."
B00DVFLJKQ,60,594,great tablet,C. Allen,5,Yes,23-Dec-14,-,0,"especially with the update they fixed everything, really a nice tablet. I prefer over the Amazon tablets because the integration of the google products like using voice for gmail is really easy."
B00DVFLJKQ,60,595,JUNK!,Donya,1,Yes,29-Oct-16,-,0,dont buy this i bought this for 300$ after one month was not able to use it very bad customer service...waste of my money!
B00DVFLJKQ,60,596,Best tablet I've ever had.,J. Patel,5,Yes,21-Nov-13,1,1,"This is probably the best purchase I have ever made. Great for reading books, browsing the web, playing games, reading comics, or watching videos.

It's light weight, but doesn't feel cheap. Screen is beautiful. The battery holds a great charge and charges fast as well.

Much better than the iPad Mini."
B00DVFLJKQ,60,597,I simply love it.,Adrian Nathan Cooper,5,Yes,25-Mar-14,-,0,"This tablet is everything I expected and more. Its fast, smooth, beautiful display, speakers sound good (although its not front facing). The only thing is that, if your not so computer literate and stuff like downloading apps will be hard for you, you probably better off going samsung or something because nexus is bear android. But other than that, this is an excellent tablet. Yet to meet a app, this tab can't handle."
B00DVFLJKQ,60,598,Five Stars,lou,5,Yes,05-Oct-16,-,0,Great android tablet. I personally like it better than my old i pad 2.
B00DVFLJKQ,60,599,The new king!!!The one from which all will be judged.,Francisco Ortiz,5,Yes,27-Aug-13,2,0,"I own an Ipad Mini, also the previous nexus, so id like to think i have the right to judge as i use both almost daily. The new 7 is all about the screen, love the resolution, i really enjoy reading on it, i still believe 8 inches should be the perfect size but 7 will do. This is a fast efficient and great tablet to have, aloows me to work and play with ease. its size allows it to be carried efforlessly. So far ive had no issues with mine so far. I love the speed, stability and screen. Overall its what i expected and more. can;t go worng with it. Also i do use it a bit more than the ipad just because android seems more to my liking. I think that for the price nothing beats it and it sets the new standard once more...so game on!!!"
B00DVFLJKQ,60,600,Nice size for a carry around basic tablet,Les Johnson,4,Yes,04-Sep-16,1,0,Nice size for a carry around basic tablet. Having a full size usb port would be nice but does a decent job for the price.
B00DVFLJKQ,61,601,Excellent tablet and excellent value,Ben R,5,Yes,15-Apr-14,1,0,"This is a fantastic tablet available for the low price of a below-average tablet.

Pros: Battery life is excellent. On auto brightness I can expect a full charge to provide 1-2 days of constant e-mail and web browsing plus some Netflix streaming and GPS use. I never, ever have to worry about running to a charger. The display is sharp with accurate colors and excellent viewing angles. The CPU and memory seem adequate for typical Android tablet use. The added rear camera and new texture are a great improvement over the old model.

Meh: It is just a tiny bit too big for one-handed operation, but doesn't include any keyboard or other settings to make this easier (3rd party tools are available). Android apps don't all have great tablet interfaces.

Cons: A microSD slot would have been nice (I'm looking at you, Google)"
B00DVFLJKQ,61,602,perfect,Terrance,5,Yes,02-Nov-14,-,0,Extremely happy with this unit. We are rv lifestyle and this small unit gives ME what I need .I am looking at a folding Bluetooth keyboard. The stylus I see is good but hunt and peck typing is slow.

B00DVFLJKQ,61,604,Issues,Diana Darlow,1,Yes,17-Mar-19,-,0,Tablet had issues. After I closed it down it would re-awaken and then it would also show the battery was drained but it wasn't. Sending it back.
B00DVFLJKQ,61,605,best tablet I've used,danny griffin,5,Yes,08-Dec-14,1,0,"Been using my nexus 7 for around 9 months now and I love it.it's not over priced, it's fast as hell and I can put it in my pocket.the specs suit my needs just fine. Damn fine tablet"

I do not speak English, I'm using google traslator. I'm sorry if you do not understand much of the comment."
B00DVFLJKQ,62,611,Seriously amazing buy. Worth every penny.,i dont know,5,Yes,28-Feb-15,-,0,Pretty amazing tablet. Battery is a bit different coming from using an iPhone 5 for everything. Charges sort of slow ( maybe inaccurate since I come from using an iPhone ) but keeps the charge amazingly well. Resolution is amazing. Truly beautiful tablet. Watched plenty of movies already. Amazing tablet. Worth every single penny
B00DVFLJKQ,62,612,The only tablet you should consider,J. Le,5,Yes,27-Feb-14,1,0,"Cheaper, more effective, super clear screen, and very fun tablet. Why pay more for something comparable? This is the tablet most people will need, just trust me & get it."
B00DVFLJKQ,62,613,Great media device,Alex G.,5,Yes,04-Nov-14,-,0,"Solid little tablet, its very easy to load movies on this Android tablet and have kids watch them on long journeys. And if you add some games as well, you've got yourself a perfect companion."
B00DVFLJKQ,62,614,Good companion as well as cell phone.,MADbookshelf,5,Yes,27-Jul-14,-,0,"Have had this for months now and really enjoy using it. It is like a small tablet in addition to being a phone with good sound. Works well with Bluetooth. Camera good, but not super great."
B00DVFLJKQ,62,615,Has some Touchscreen Problems,Duke,3,Yes,07-Jun-14,-,0,"This is my second Asus Nexus tablet. Had gen 1 and now this one. Gen 2 seems to have a pretty pervasive touchscreen problem that causes it to be laggy and non-responsive even though it's running KitKat 4.4.3. I ""googled"" this issue and found a ton of forum related posts and discussions regarding this issue. Surprisingly enough, people have been reporting this since Oct/Nov 2013 without any official response/fix by either Asus or Google. Anyway, I was able to find a settings adjustment involving changing about 5 or 6 settings that people claim has solved their problems. I made these and at first glance, it may have fixed it. But honestly, you never know about this kind of fix for a couple months. This problem was sporadic and can't be judged until some time has passed. I just posted this because of my disappointment with Google/Asus allowing this issue to persist after having been discovered quite some time ago. I will update this after some trials and before the deadline for returning."
B00DVFLJKQ,62,616,It is a great device. The only thing wrong is the USB ...,Spider2,5,Yes,18-Feb-15,-,0,It is a great device. The only thing wrong is the USB connector does not last long. The prior unit USB connector only lasted nine months. Otherwise the unit accomplished all I had expected.

Great!!,Harley,5,Yes,13-Aug-14,1,0,"I looked around awhile for what I felt was the best for me and bought the Nexus 7, just fantastic peace of electronic engineering , I am very impressed, the weight is light easy to hold, all the apps I needed . picture quality is wonderful. I really love the ease of use and the battery life of 9 hr. and so much more. Very low price for what your getting in return."
B00DVFLJKQ,62,619,Works great. Fast and responsive.,D. Valencia,5,Yes,29-Nov-13,2,0,"Unboxing and setup was a snap. The device is snappy, especially after the 4.4 Kit Kat update. I made sure to test the GPS for issues right away and so far it seems to be working great."
B00DVFLJKQ,62,620,Fantastic,Meg,5,Yes,10-Jun-14,-,0,"I love the nexus 7! It's lightweight, the picture is amazingly clear and the sound quality is fantastic. Everything runs smoothly. And the price is quite affordable. I would definitely recommend this over an iPad."

B00DVFLJKQ,63,622,Great Tablet!!!!,Jeremy Langley,5,Yes,03-Mar-14,-,0,I have not owned this very long but so far love it!!!! This is the easiest tablet to operate I have owned .. I took the time to research (a friend of mine has ipad with aviation apps) and he is now thinking of switching!!! After reading the review and the apps and programs for the tablets this is the best for the money!!! There are a lot of accessories for the tablet that my friend cant use on his ipad and mine is a lot cheaper. I don't like paying for the name.. I would recommend the Nexus 7 (2nd gen) to anyone. Thanks for the great product!!!!!
B00DVFLJKQ,63,623,good but expected better,Jan Lee Shih Yi,3,Yes,09-Feb-14,-,3,"have not play around with it fully but first impressions is underwhelming. Start-up is slow and although screen is HD (i.e presumably with watching videos in mind) cannot seem to play various format of movie files very well. Had to download VLC player for easy playback of videos. Also video screen does not seem to be able to display full file names; always in thumbnail mode. I'm sure there is a ""list"" video file mode but can't figure out how - perhaps I'm too tablet illiterate but I would appreciate an operating manual but THERE ISN'T ONE!!!"
B00DVFLJKQ,63,624,Awesome Tablet!,tyler evan miller,5,Yes,13-Dec-14,-,0,Since I've had my nexus 7 it has been totally amazing! It is a huge bang for my buck and does even more than I expected. I still say that even in 2014 and into 2015 this is still the beat tablet for your money!
B00DVFLJKQ,63,625,Didn't like it.,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,13-Apr-18,-,0,"Locked up first time using, never liked it after that, returned it, bought Kindle HDX best bang for your buck."
B00DVFLJKQ,63,626,Great pad,Ed,5,Yes,23-Dec-13,-,0,So this is the first pad I purchased and I am still working on finding out what it can do for me. To date I am very happy with the apps that are installed and the selection that is available on Google. The screen is awsome!
B00DVFLJKQ,63,627,Asus takes win,masterkyle,5,Yes,13-Apr-14,1,0,"This tablet is super fast and makes me want to upgrade my slow aging smart phone. This tab met and exceeded my expectations on what a fast tab should be, and now I can't go back to anything less than a quad-core based device.

However, I picked up on a few faults in my usage thus far. The keyboard sometimes ""hang"" on me. I'ts like a little lag where the whole screen freezes and you can't press anything for about five seconds. I am monitoring this while it happens a few times a day.

The gallery app somehow kept telling me that it became unresponsive and had to close,but I fixed that by clearing the app cache and data then restarting thee device.

These issues were cleared up when I updated to 4.4 kit Kat.

I would recommend this nexus 7 to anyone looking for a blazing fast device for reading, gamimng,surfing etc. Oh yes forgot to mention the tablet is so well equipped it handles any game I've thrown at it at with graphic settings running at full max.

I would want to buy a nexus smartphone but lg makes that one and not Asus."
B00DVFLJKQ,63,628,"Brand new, good price",D. Harlan,5,Yes,01-Mar-15,-,0,Best tablet out there. Blows away Applepads. Mine broke in a car accident after 9 months of use and I immediately went to get a replacement. All my Apps transferred easily at no cost.

B00DVFLJKQ,64,631,So far I am pleased,J. Hintze,5,Yes,19-Jul-14,-,0,I've only had the tablet for a couple of weeks and it seems fine so far. Tablet is fast and the screen is excellent. Was a bit cheaper on Amazon then buying directly from Google too.
B00DVFLJKQ,64,632,The display is great. Been playing intense graphic games,Lance Reyes,5,Yes,30-Oct-14,2,0,"The display is great. Been playing intense graphic games. But hasn't lag since I got the it.
If you're on a budget get this. But if you have a little more money to spend. Get HTC nexus 9"
B00DVFLJKQ,64,633,I adore this tablet.,Richard B.,5,Yes,02-Nov-13,-,0,"I was initially a little concerned about the shape of this thing, with the weirdly large bezel at the top and bottom, but I pretty much instantly fell in love with it once it was in my hands and set up. It's the perfect size for what I wanted and it's wonderful in landscape mode especially. The screen is lovely and I haven't had a single problem with it. I often keep it in a case, but I think it's nicer outside the case. It feels good in your hands and I quite like the rubberized back or whatever. I also like the operating system quite a bit. I had considered getting an iPad mini instead but a friend happened to buy an iPad and needed help setting it up so I set it up for her and played with it a bit and found that it didn't have a lot of the core functions I use with my android devices every day. I also much prefer the navigation in these Nexus devices than other android devices out there. I'm really tempted get a Nexus 10 but heaven knows I have more than enough gadgets to meet my needs!"
B00DVFLJKQ,64,634,Formidable!!!,Cliente Amazon,5,Yes,26-Nov-13,2,0,"Wonderful ! Very powerful , fits the hand , fantastic screen and great google apps .
Android 4.3 system with a key difference: unlike other mobile devices running android sitema , suppliers of equipment has to provide the atulaizações system to "" fit "" on the product .

B00DVFLJKQ,64,639,Light and powerful,Michael,5,Yes,05-Feb-14,-,0,Had a TF101 which just died and decided to get the Nexus 7 2013 model. An excellent decision . I loved my 10 inch screen yet I like the Nexus 7 much more. Durable and very light and a heck of a lot faster and the screen is pure joy to my eyes.
B00DVFLJKQ,64,640,Perfect,M. E. Nelson,5,Yes,26-Dec-13,-,0,"This tablet is extremely good and I would recommend it to anyone, in which I do. This is one of the only American made computer companies and everyone should purchase ASUS in anything you do. Very reliable."

B00DVFLJKQ,65,642,Excellent tablet,MOSTER,5,Yes,18-Feb-14,1,0,"I find this size tablet to be ideal, it still fits in your hand but you also get about 3 times the screen space of most phones. It's fast, the display is sharp and bright."
B00DVFLJKQ,65,643,Best tablet ever,o2jr,4,Yes,20-Jan-14,-,0,"Best tablet ever, screen is flawless, super fast, kit kat is awesome. battery life awesome too.

cons:

speakers can be a little bit louder"
B00DVFLJKQ,65,644,"Spiffy, great resolution - but unreliable",John K. Garrity,2,Yes,20-Sep-13,2,1,"The nexus 7(2013) is a sharp piece of work. Elegant design, super resolution. But it freezes and the only way to get it working again is to reset it and lose all your data. I sent back my first Nexus 7 after it froze three times in a little over two weeks and I am going to send back my second one tomorrow for the same reason. There seems to be no fix for the problem that doesn't involve wiping out all one's stored data. You have to be nuts to buy one of these."
B00DVFLJKQ,65,645,It's okay,derek duncan,3,Yes,16-Sep-13,3,0,"I love the product, however it took me 4 times to get one from Amazon that wasn't defective (mushy buttons, dead pixels, graphics glitches)."

B00DVFLJKQ,65,648,A Gift that Hit a Homerun,Jim C.,5,Yes,27-Jan-14,3,0,I bought the Google Nexus 7 Tablet for my sister for Christmas. She loves it and uses it daily. It was a homerun.
B00DVFLJKQ,65,649,Giving up smart phone!!,dks107,5,Yes,09-Sep-13,-,0,I love the Nexus 7! It is easy to learn and the picture and audio are awesome. I am a speech pathologist and have two home businesses. I am able to use it for so many applications. I am going to give up my big smart phone bill and use this instead. My mother bought the Nexus 10. She is 73 and has had no problem learning to use it!
B00DVFLJKQ,65,650,Great tablet,millworker,5,Yes,03-Mar-14,-,0,I purchased two of these. One for me and one for my wife. We absolutely love them. The speed at which we can process apps or web use is blazingly fast. Design and built is great. Definitely recommend 32gb. Well worth it.

B00DVFLJKQ,66,653,Not a happy,Leroy Record,1,Yes,29-Apr-15,1,0,It has already crashed and I am going to have to send in for repair. Not a happy customer
B00DVFLJKQ,66,654,Best tablet I've used.,Tracy G,5,Yes,18-Jan-14,-,0,I love this tablet. It is the perfect size to hold while still providing plenty of screen real estate. I think the Google/Android operating system has finally found hardware that can match the durability of the OS.
B00DVFLJKQ,66,655,"Nexus 7, bah humbug!",W. Combs,2,Yes,29-Apr-14,1,1,"A found this item to be very very unreliable, better that you buy the ""Galaxy tab 3"". This nexus 7 is defective just powering up & down."
B00DVFLJKQ,66,656,"I use it too much to give 3 stars, but google is on my crap list",Luke P.,4,Yes,05-Jun-14,-,0,"As tablets go, it has good horsepower and is just the right size to hold with beautiful resolution. I miss not having a micro SD slot and it was just plain stupid of google to remove native support for external storage through the micro usb port. hdmi over micro usb works fine, and i like the added wireless charging, only other annoyance is again google decided for me what features i want (like cloud vs usb storage). If i plug in a usb ethernet adapter that works on any other android device, i have to drop down to a terminal emulator to find out the IP. the nexus is missing a base feature that's in android for recognizing other network connections. Google's BS makes me want to give it three or less stars, but everything else it does it does exceptionally well, and i can at least get around the storage issue using free 3rd party apps so put that in my pipe and smoke it google."
B00DVFLJKQ,66,657,Meh. If you have a Note phone don't bother.,Pecan Barn,4,Yes,18-Mar-14,-,0,Just a bigger bulkier version of what you already have. Why carry two things? I am real proponent of Android and Nexus products in general but just not much more difference than my Note II phablet.

B00DVFLJKQ,66,659,"Great device, small but powerful",Matthew Kwan,5,Yes,03-Mar-14,-,0,"Bought it mainly for use while on the bus or train. Can easily be held in one hand, it's also great for taking notes in classes when paired with a Bluetooth keyboard or even just the swipe keyboard"
B00DVFLJKQ,66,660,Good initially but failed soon,Johnny Congo,1,Yes,13-Aug-14,3,1,"This tablet was ok for about 3 months then the touchscreen failed but it was out of warranty. Upon investigation it turns out that many many of these tablets have the same fault. Some people are on their third replacement. Come on, Asus."
B00DVFLJKQ,67,661,Nice unit. Works well,Jim R,5,Yes,25-Dec-14,-,0,"Nice unit. Works well, and is fast. My only regret is that I should have gone with a larger size as my 50 year old eyes need bigger screens these days."
B00DVFLJKQ,67,662,Best tablet ever,Stinky Greg,5,Yes,13-May-14,-,0,I totally love this tablet. It's the fastest & most responsive android device I've ever used. I'm very happy that I chose the 32 gig model as I plan on using this for a long time.

B00DVFLJKQ,67,664,Great Portable Size,oillogger,5,Yes,06-Jul-14,-,1,Great size to carry around. Not a house tablet but a travel one. I view webpages in standard view. I cannot keep it out of my wife's hands. Perfect size to also serve as a auto GPS.
B00DVFLJKQ,67,665,Great screen on a great tablet!,J. Young,5,Yes,04-Mar-14,-,0,The feel of the Nexus 7 tablet is solid and the screen is very nice. I haven't had any issues in the several weeks since purchasing from Amazon Warehouse Deals. Very happy with the device and it's performance.
B00DVFLJKQ,67,666,Better than the iPad or Kindle,Jason Brown,5,Yes,20-Jan-15,-,0,"I cannot say enough great things about this mighty little tablet! We have had the iPads and the Kindles, and this is by far our favorite! My kids love it, and it is their favorite as well."
B00DVFLJKQ,67,667,Great unit,TPG,5,Yes,13-Jan-14,-,0,Very nice unit and feels very comfortable in the hand. Nice finish on the backside that seems to prevent slipping. Very fast. Love it but had a return it because I decided I wanted a lte unit to connect to a carrier.
B00DVFLJKQ,67,668,great tablet,joey l,5,Yes,20-Dec-14,-,0,I've had this tablet for close to a year now and it still runs like new. The tablet is thin and fast. It handles everything I throw at it. Highly recommend this tablet.

B00DVFLJKQ,68,672,Great device.,pz,5,Yes,03-Nov-15,-,0,I love these things. I only hope Google continues with a new Nexus tablet. There is some suggestion lately that they will.

B00DVFLJKQ,68,674,Easy to use,Mikebergy,5,Yes,08-Aug-14,1,0,"Easy to use, excellent little tablet. Plenty of reviews online. As good as the apps you choose to use. It has not let me down yet."
B00DVFLJKQ,68,675,great value,Lon Boysen,5,Yes,22-Apr-14,1,0,"Very happy with the Nexus. Wonderful color on the screen. Functions well.

Sometimes the touch screen does not operate properly."
B00DVFLJKQ,68,676,"Although the Nexus 7 is a good tablet, for the most part",rbp101,2,Yes,30-Jul-15,2,0,"Although the Nexus 7 is a good tablet, for the most part, I chose to buy this through Amazon Warehouse Deals, which was a big mistake on my part. For, there appears to be no way of knowing how long the remainder of the warranty is good for, or if it has any warranty at all. And, I know now more than ever that this is the risk you take with electronics. For, my Nexus 7 2013 edition died within the first year and there was no warranty left when I checked with Asus. So, although it was ""used like new,"" the ""used"" part is where you need to be concerned when purchasing from Amazon Warehouse Deals. For, you may get it a bit cheaper; but if it breaks soon thereafter, you will likely be out of luck and end up paying much more in the long run."
B00DVFLJKQ,68,677,Four Stars,2ceder waxwings,4,Yes,02-Nov-16,-,0,Good for first time computer users
B00DVFLJKQ,68,678,Almost Perfect,Terry M,4,Yes,28-Mar-14,-,0,"This is light and easy to use as an ereader and tablet. Screen is a good size and uses little battery power. It does have a glitch from Google on updates that causes it to lock up and you have to do a ton of research to figure out how to get it to work again, but it can be done at the sacrafice of loosing all data."
B00DVFLJKQ,68,679,Works great! We were a bit nervous about getting a ...,jewelrymom0810,5,Yes,06-Apr-15,1,0,"Works great! We were a bit nervous about getting a refurbished nexus, but we've had no problems with it and it's been functioning great."

B00DVFLJKQ,69,681,Great tablet,Clockwork,4,Yes,01-Apr-14,-,0,"Great tablet light,fast and easy to navigate. Well built and one of the few tablets that gets immediate updates from google. Only thing that could use improvement is battery life."
B00DVFLJKQ,69,682,Excellent Tablet for the Price,Fussyshopper,5,Yes,28-Jun-14,-,0,This tablet is used by a nine year old. Previously had a 16GB Nexus 7 that developed a problem with the charging connection. This time we are using a cradle charger. This tablet is much faster than the year old 16GB Nexus 7.
B00DVFLJKQ,69,683,GREAT TABLET,Di,5,Yes,25-Jan-14,1,0,"Great tablet, I use it all of the time now. There are tons of apps and games available. The graphics are great. It has a strong WiFi and is easy to use. I used it to write this review. So spend a little more and buy this one. I want to mention that this review was done by my husband. It was a Christmas gift. A friend recommended it. He loves it. Takes it with him everywhere."
B00DVFLJKQ,69,684,I'm happy with this purchase,John B,5,Yes,17-Oct-15,-,0,"I'm happy with this purchase. It may crash depending your usage and the processing it handles but a quick restart will do the trick.
use it to browse around the internet, facebook, twitter, skype call, youtube and watch movies, etc..."
B00DVFLJKQ,69,685,Best tablet at present!,Deipnosophist,5,Yes,20-Mar-14,-,0,"Flawless screen, easy touch navigation, get the 32GB version and it's plenty for most users..NOT a PC substitute, but could be great for a student or business uses with bluetooth keyboard!"
B00DVFLJKQ,69,686,MUCH improved!,Richard S,4,Yes,18-Nov-13,2,0,"SO much better than the 2012 edition that was SO slow and laggy.
THIS is how the Nexus 7 should had been from the start!"
B00DVFLJKQ,69,687,Great Mobile Device,GoodSwimma,5,Yes,12-Aug-13,1,0,"The reviews posted in various other outlets really praise the Nexus 7 as the best value for its size, build quality, capabilities, light weight, and ability to be held in one hand. With pure android installed on the device, this was an essential feature for me. It's a great mobile and companion device for the work that I do. Notes, photos, reports on the go, calendars, tasks, reminders, email, and much more.

With that in mind, I have just a couple issues with the device. The first is the camera quality. If you're buying this to take great photos, you may be somewhat disappointed as it may not meet the quality of some of the latest smartphones or standalone point and shoot cameras. For my work needs though, it's just fine.

The other issue was that a cleaning cloth was not included in the package. Seems like a notable oversight on Asus' part as with many other smartphone or tablet devices, fingerprints from touching and smudges from swiping proliferate the device with regular usage. I did find this to be a bit of a let down and had to purchase a few on my own."
B00DVFLJKQ,69,688,can't say enough good things about this tablet,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,03-May-16,-,0,"still using it since 2013
I think it's one of the best tablets made"
B00DVFLJKQ,69,689,Five Stars,AzFosterKatz,5,Yes,28-Nov-15,-,0,I've had this tablet for about 2 years and it recently upgraded to Android marshmallow with no problem.
B00DVFLJKQ,69,690,2 years and still going strong,Marcus,5,Yes,22-Feb-16,-,0,"Out of the box, this is a fantastic device. You're given the standard, lightweight Android experience with a high resolution display and a processor that never seems to really struggle. Battery life hasn't diminished and the soft touch back still feels as good as it did the day I bought it."
B00DVFLJKQ,70,691,Perfect for my use,Dominic Mcfadden,5,Yes,09-May-14,2,0,Used it with a Canon 70D and the DSLR controller app. The touch screen feature it adds is ammazing and the colors from the playback are better than most computers.
B00DVFLJKQ,70,692,"This is my third Asus Nexus 7 tablet, 2nd generation",Gaetano BonGiovanni,2,Yes,08-May-17,1,0,"I bought it from a private seller on Amazon who said all was fine, and when it arrived it did feel like all was fine, but after installing a shield on the unit, things started to go bad, in that the screen soon required multiple presses to get any response. That was a new experience as I had used screens with my previous two units, with no problems. I removed the screen, but the problem continued so I took it in for repair. Turns out the sensor in this third unit was proven faulty, and also affected the auto rotate screen function, and further, just highlighting for cut and paste became a real bother. Please note I do not blame the seller, as it may well have happened just on its own, as the unit is now several years old. I feel sure the seller was factual, and since these things do happen to electronics, I waited a long time before reviewing it. (This review is about the unit, not the seller.)"
B00DVFLJKQ,70,693,"Simply put, reliable and easy to use.",mjkilb,5,Yes,03-Dec-16,-,0,Use it every day. Only one con is there is no SD memory expansion. I would buy one again.
B00DVFLJKQ,70,694,Device No Longer Works After 2 Years,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,08-Feb-16,1,1,Faulty update issued by Asus and Google crashed and bricked my device. I had kept the stock operating system and took exceedingly good care of the device the entire time I owned it. Now Asus is charging over $200 to fix it. Not worth it if it doesn't work after only 2 years.
B00DVFLJKQ,70,695,Many improvements (they are listed in the description) but also a major flaw,tmj,4,Yes,23-Aug-13,1,0,"You can look up in the Nexus 7's item description about the improvements made over the first version of the Nexus 7.

To me:
- runs much faster, smoother, without freezing (except one morning the tablet turned on when I pressed the power button, but the entire screen did not respond to touch; somehow I was able to format the tablet, and no issues since)

- thinner, more portable

- speakers: I do not think that this is advertised clearly: this new Nexus 7 has surround sound technology! And it works awesome with movies and music that has surround sound.

- screen: much brighter, clear

Flaw:

- the screen is too sensitive: this makes typing, selecting, and other screen features difficult to use."
B00DVFLJKQ,70,696,overall disappointed with performance,HMS,3,Yes,10-Jun-14,-,1,"overall I'm disappointed in a tablet. It drops wifi frequently. The apps crash frequently and the browser freezes up.
If I had it to do over, I would purchase another brand."
B00DVFLJKQ,70,697,Overall- great.,Christoph Rothschild,4,Yes,26-Jan-14,2,0,"Love the tablet. I use it constantly and it performs well. Only issue is how the touch screen responds. Rather, how it occasionally does not respond. It happens infrequently and is fixed by turning the screen off and then on, but could be a drag if you play a lot of games. It's a minor issue; I'd recommend the nexus7 highly, even with the (perhaps isolated) touchscreen issue."
B00DVFLJKQ,70,698,Just as expected,Stuart R. Perkins,5,Yes,28-Mar-14,-,0,"Works great, just as expected. Had to return because wife wanted larger tablet. Return process painless. No problem with the Nexus 7. Larger screen (print size) needed."
B00DVFLJKQ,70,699,Just buy it,janus,5,Yes,17-Feb-16,1,0,"What can I say that hasn't been said already. As someone who had the 2012 model, this is by far better. For something that's 3 years old, it's more than great"
B00DVFLJKQ,70,700,Great for catching up on facebook or surfing the internet,Jim VanBeek,5,Yes,19-Aug-15,-,0,Very handy. It has replaced my laptop for much of my casual use at home. Great for catching up on facebook or surfing the internet.
B00DVFLJKQ,71,701,Great size tablet.,HD_CH3F,5,Yes,07-Aug-14,1,0,"Great size, fantastic product. It's been my favorite tablet so far. If you're doing a laptop replacement, this guy will be too small."

B00DVFLJKQ,71,703,Nexus Is The Heat,Stan,5,Yes,24-Jan-14,1,0,"I am thoroughly impressed with my 7. It isn't the biggest tablet, but it certainly firms the trick. I do much more on it now than on my laptop."
B00DVFLJKQ,71,704,Really poor make quality,Soumendu C.,1,Yes,12-Nov-16,-,0,"Really poor make quality. Did not last 7 days of usage.
The Version 1 of the Nexus tab was really well made - still going strong."
B00DVFLJKQ,71,705,Major touchscreen issues,NONE YA,2,Yes,10-Apr-14,2,1,I had and loved the previous model's quality. This one's screen however has three non responsive spots on it. I often have to give accomplishing tasks on this device.
B00DVFLJKQ,71,706,So GOOD i want Another!,Aerohitman,5,Yes,10-Dec-13,-,0,"Loving it soooo much, own a Kindle and while i love that too this has some features that i love and not to mention the power and just overall beauty of it. Im gonna end up buying another very soon."
B00DVFLJKQ,71,707,but was a nice phone back in the day,Sondra,5,Yes,03-May-16,-,0,"No longer have it, but was a nice phone back in the day."
B00DVFLJKQ,71,708,Much better than gen1,NorCal,5,Yes,20-Oct-13,-,0,"I was forced to upgrade after my gen 1 nexus 7 suffered an unfortunate accident. The gen 2 is faster, the screen is amazing, and I like the form factor a little better. Mostly the screen is amazing, the glass instead of plastic gives it an iPad/smartphone feel instead of the plastic feel the first gen had. At some point I'm sure there just so many pixels that we can't tell the difference anymore but this is much sharper than the previous version. Battery life seems good so far, no significant change. Would I buy a gen 2 if I still had my old tablet - probably not, but I'm pretty happy now that I've got it.

Google and Apple - if you read this, versions are important, just call it nexus 7 gen 2 for god sakes. Not 2013, not ""New"", just rev it like you do everything else."

B00DVFLJKQ,72,715,Five Stars,Kevin K.,5,Yes,06-Apr-15,1,0,Wonderful tablet. Plenty of power and more pixels than a lot of TVs for a small budget.
B00DVFLJKQ,72,716,Wonderful!!!,esesn,5,Yes,19-Jan-14,-,0,"Everyday I am finding new things this tablet does, it's a lot of fun. I mostly do e-mail, Facebook, games, and pictures. I love it. Perfect size, fits right in my purse."
B00DVFLJKQ,72,717,excellent,bonnet,5,Yes,24-Dec-13,-,0,Got this after reading rave reviews. So far they have been justified. Brilliant display. Does more than wife's I-pad and is only about 1/3 the weight and size. Huge battery life too.
B00DVFLJKQ,72,718,Gotta love the screen...,Elwin N. McKellar,4,Yes,07-Apr-14,2,0,"The screen is brilliant and responsive and the Nexus connected immediately to my home network. This is my first small tablet and I am pleased with how it performs. I (rather unfairly, perhaps) rated it four out of five for two reasons unrelated to the machine performance of this device. First, many of the basic apps are terribly cryptic and extremely buggy and it's difficult to determine where the fault lies when using an unfamiliar device and operating system. Second, I have large hands, and tapping the screen is a little like trying to use my TV remote with my toes or my elbow. It is frustrating to see so clearly the link I want to select on that terrific screen, and try to hit that tiny bullseye with a telephone pole. However, the screen is great, the speed is very good, and even the tiny speakers sound better than I expected."
B00DVFLJKQ,72,719,Good value,Jason A. Wyant,5,Yes,31-Dec-14,-,0,This was a gift for my wife back in November. I don't think she's put it down since! Had absolutely no problems and she's been very happy with it.
B00DVFLJKQ,72,720,Great product,Amedeo VOLATO SCUOTTO,5,Yes,26-Nov-13,2,0,"Amazing product, incredible screen and speed. And a ""stock"" updated Android. The size is good for me for most of the usage, and currently it's replacing my 10"" tablet. And it's eassy to find a place in the laptop bag for it.
For the moment I cannot tell nothing about the battery life. To check during next trip."
B00DVFLJKQ,73,721,Five Stars,Ken,5,Yes,18-Feb-16,-,0,"Hate the bezel size on the ends but oh well, nice device other than that"
B00DVFLJKQ,73,722,No issue,mj calabines,4,Yes,16-Jan-16,-,0,Never had an issue with my nexus 7. The price is so practical and it does exactly its purpose. No problem with the delivery too.
B00DVFLJKQ,73,723,"Great product , when it's not defective",gabriel cappelli,3,Yes,11-Dec-13,1,0,"The nexus that was send it to me was defective (there is a loss of light at the top and the image of android 4.3 was corrupted, that got fixed it by the update on 4.4, but the loss of light is annoying at night,and since I use already for a trip, I guess I will keep it and live with that, also the price was more than the other places (Google offer $25 credit and $15 cheaper) should it done my homework, since Amazon is not the best place to shop anymore...."
B00DVFLJKQ,73,724,Gift for my fiancee,KAG,5,Yes,30-Dec-13,-,0,"I bought this as a gift for my fiancee. He loved it! I have an iPad2, so having a smaller tablet is perfect for him. He takes it to work and uses apps here instead of his phone."
B00DVFLJKQ,73,725,The tablet has been great for my son,Sean Apsey,5,Yes,30-Jun-16,-,0,The tablet has been great for my son. Easy to use and a descent price. Clean android is so much better that any of the skinned android devices.
B00DVFLJKQ,73,726,Fantastic tablet! We have 3 of these now,Eric Rakes,5,Yes,07-Dec-14,1,0,Fantastic tablet! We have 3 of these now. just disregard the instructions when you first boot it up... charge it for at least an hour or so first.
B00DVFLJKQ,73,727,Great tablet. This is my second (it has more ...,Charles B.,5,Yes,23-May-16,-,0,Great tablet. This is my second (it has more memory) and I use both.
B00DVFLJKQ,73,728,Really impressed,Patti Kleist,5,Yes,08-Jan-14,-,0,"I have had my Nexus for a couple of weeks now, and I keep finding new uses and apps. Recently I was impressed, because after using it as a music player for amost 8 hours at work, the battery was still at 80%.

I would definitely recommend this tablet to my friends that want a convenient way to replicate what they now do on their computers/book readers/audio and video players.

Now if I can only find the optimal way to use it as a phone."
B00DVFLJKQ,73,729,Love it!,Lynn,4,Yes,25-Jan-16,-,0,A definite upgrade from the 1st generation. I still wish for a longer battery life when in use however.
B00DVFLJKQ,73,730,Must be off to charge,A. Alexander,5,Yes,11-Mar-14,-,1,"I have only had the Nexus for a week but so far so good. Really like having something bigger than my iPhone but much lighter than a laptop. (Duh! the appeal of tablets). When you first get it, don't turn it on - plug it in for 10 hours. I googled it and apparently it can't charge while turned on - uses more juice than a cell phone. Or if you think I have a defective one leave me a comment. I have been able to easily set up the apps I use and am using it every night.

Update: The commenter was correct (thanks!) - it should charge while plugged in. I returned it and got another one. The latest one seems to be working well, thankfully. But it was definitely disconcerting to have a problem like that out of the box. Other than that though, I love it. Let's hope no problems develop over time."
B00DVFLJKQ,74,731,Great tablet,A. Paez,5,Yes,17-Apr-14,1,0,I love my Nexus. It's a great size and very quick. I use my laptop even less now that I have this. Fits my work bag and coat pocket perfect and great for taking places.
B00DVFLJKQ,74,732,Awesome little tablet.,Neil,5,Yes,02-Sep-13,-,0,The new Nexus 7 FHD is better than I expected. It is set up so easily that I could give one to my mother who is technically challenged and know that I would not get a phone call asking how to set it up. This little guy is also faster than my HTC One X+ which also sports a quad core processor but does not have 2gb of RAM. I have been using this for about a month now and have not had any problems yet. I also like that the operating system has been updated twice since I received it. I just sold my old Asus TFT101 when I got this and I was happy with the build quality of it as well. Asus does a spectacular job with their quality of craftsmanship and Google is putting out the cutting edge updates for this system. I am confident that this tablet will be with me for quite a while.
B00DVFLJKQ,74,733,A winner!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,18-Aug-14,-,0,This is a wonderful device and it works for me instead of carrying a lap top when on short travels! Love the screen. Best is that it is exactly like my phone so the learning curve was zip.
B00DVFLJKQ,74,734,Five Stars,michelle Kelly,5,Yes,04-Aug-15,-,0,I love my tablet. This does everything I wanted to do and has enough memory for all my needs!
B00DVFLJKQ,74,735,nice tablet,TheLastLeprechaun,4,Yes,05-Jan-14,-,0,"I like my new Nexus just as much as my iPad with the exception of the smaller screen size. And when watching YouTube videos, it takes a long time to download videos versus my iPad. For the price, well worth it."
B00DVFLJKQ,74,736,"This is an amazing tablet, I am so happy I bought it",Ariel,5,Yes,19-Nov-14,-,0,"This is an amazing tablet, I am so happy I bought it. I was debating for weeks. I am so happy with my purchase, much better than an ipad!"
B00DVFLJKQ,74,737,Five Stars,L. J. Bade,5,Yes,05-Apr-16,-,0,"Awesom, especially for a 4 year old design. My wife completely loves it."
B00DVFLJKQ,74,738,I love it!,Mishka,5,Yes,07-Aug-15,-,0,Worked well for my uses. My first tablet and after a year it is still a great thing to have.
B00DVFLJKQ,74,739,"AotA agree, this is a fantastic tablet.",Mat Lee,5,Yes,13-Dec-14,-,0,"One of the best, I need to buy another one. I love this thing. It even got great reviews on our Android podcast, Attack of the Androids."
B00DVFLJKQ,74,740,Luck of the draw,Mike S,2,Yes,06-Jan-15,-,0,I like the Nexus 7. It has plenty of power and a great screen but this one would not turn on. Probably just a fluke. I might try again.
B00DVFLJKQ,75,741,The perfect tablet at a afforable price,Mohammed Ahmed,5,Yes,03-Apr-14,4,0,"Great tablet. A power house for the price, it might not look as awesome as the new iPad Air, but thats only if you are willing to dish out $600+. for $279 (32gb version) I couldn't be happier with the price and performance. By far the best tablet in the market right now."
B00DVFLJKQ,75,742,Nexus 7,Cronus,3,Yes,08-Jul-14,1,1,Great reviews so I brought it. This tab is not for everyone. I was not impressed. Decent quality but I think a bit pricey.
B00DVFLJKQ,75,743,Its a great inversion at long time. Love it! =),Armando Torres,5,Yes,08-Jan-16,-,0,Best tablet ever. Ultra fast and ultra bright. Size is just perfect. By being a pure google android it will always get updated to the newest version of the android platform. Its a great inversion at long time.
B00DVFLJKQ,75,744,Still a fine tablet.,James C,4,Yes,29-Sep-14,-,0,"Nice tablet, I have bought two of them. First one was run over by a truck. So while shopping for a replacement I couldn't find a better value so I bought a second one. The WiFi works great, graphics are nice and I use it more than my computer. There is an app for everything which makes it a valuable tool. My battery will last about 6 hours depending on what you're doing."
B00DVFLJKQ,75,745,Five Stars,Crudstud,5,Yes,09-Jul-16,-,0,charges by wifi. my micro usb charging port is dead
B00DVFLJKQ,75,746,Amazing tablet,Mark Y,5,Yes,24-Sep-15,1,0,Still one of the best tablets you can buy!
B00DVFLJKQ,75,747,"excellent value and performance, Just buy it",Brian Monahan,5,Yes,08-Jan-14,-,0,"The display is peerless for its size and the android operating experience ( version 4.4) is very good. The OS and google apps are very well integrated and the google Play store has been a comparable experience to the ipod app store. At first I missed the Apple Itunes sore experience but for what I use a tablet for ( email, digital photo display and web browsing) no other tablet comes close for its price and ability to fit in an inside jacekt pocket of a business suit. I purchased a HMDI wifi dongle that I can plug into many large screen flat screeens and ""mirror-cast"" the display and sound wirelessly without a problem. (my attempts to use the slimport adapter for a similar purpose with a cable did not work for me even with 4.4.2 android update.)"
B00DVFLJKQ,75,748,It is amazing!!,Tanya M. Schroeder,5,Yes,20-Mar-16,-,0,Both my husband and son own a Nexus 7! It is amazing!!!!! Better than IPad anyday! I would highly recommend.
B00DVFLJKQ,75,749,A great item that I wanted for a long time,Mary Truly,5,Yes,14-Jul-14,-,0,"A great item that I wanted for a long time. I am still learning about it and having great fun.
Wish it had came with a printed how to book or booklet. Too often companies assume
if we are buying one we should already know how to use it.
I am 76 years and still like printed readable how to directions."
B00DVFLJKQ,75,750,Five Stars,Noel,5,Yes,01-Sep-16,-,0,fantastic product! loved it! :)
B00DVFLJKQ,76,751,"Great resolution, very responsive touchscreen",Class37,5,Yes,13-Dec-14,-,0,"Great resolution, very responsive touchscreen, weighs practically nothing, runs really smoooooooth. So far haven't had any problems with it at all. I like this tablet a lot."
B00DVFLJKQ,76,752,Great tablet,Mark,5,Yes,01-Aug-14,1,0,"This is a great tablet, small enough to take with you anywhere and the battery life is good."
B00DVFLJKQ,76,753,Bad workmanship,Slow Loris,1,Yes,29-Dec-14,-,0,"Screen was flaky with typing input for quite some time. Then has stopped pretty much altogether. I would return it - or try to (might be out of warranty period) but I live too remote for this. So the take home message here is bad quality workmanship putting out dodgy products. I looked after this, no drops etc but it just expired. Some internet searching reveals screen problems for other buyers of this product, so beware,"
B00DVFLJKQ,76,754,Wanted features not offered on my Kindle Fire.,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,04-Jan-14,-,0,This tablet has amazing graphics. Skypes easily and I love the front and rear facing camera.It loaded all of my apps from my Google store without a problem.
B00DVFLJKQ,76,755,No Support,NetMorin,1,Yes,25-Feb-14,1,2,"Great tablet. Probably the best 7 inch on the market today. But, some of the early models can have a screen response issue. From time to time you'll have issues paging up and down in a web page. Or a game won't respond for a few seconds. But, the real issue is that Asus can't fix the issue (I sent my tablet back twice) and they won't replace it. So, I'm stuck with the best tablet could find, but from time to time it is useless. Plug it into a power source and it works fine all the time. But who wants a hardwired tablet? Buy one, I'm sure yours will work fine now. BUT, ASUS, I'M DONE BUYING YOUR PRODUCTS. Make any production mistakes you want, but, you have to stand behind your products!!!!! You did NOT!!!"
B00DVFLJKQ,76,756,Satisfiying tablet. Perfect size,azad khan,5,Yes,22-Jan-16,-,0,Very good design. I like it better than the samsung tablets of similar price. It is the best compared t its price range. The best thing about nexus 7 is you get the updates before any other device as it is a google product.
B00DVFLJKQ,76,757,Wonderful,Dr Julius,5,Yes,22-Feb-14,1,0,"I owned the version before this and was already impressed with it. Gave it to my 8 year old son and got this one...I absolutely love it....slim, so I can drop it into my coat pocket at work...surprisingly fast...camera is much crisper than I thought...in short...I'm hooked!!!"
B00DVFLJKQ,76,758,Love this tablet,jlove3,5,Yes,31-Jan-15,-,0,"Love this tablet. Does everything I need it to. Decent battery life too. Use it for class, travel, leisure, etc. Very versatile."
B00DVFLJKQ,76,759,All I can say is WOW! I'd give it 6 stars if they would let me.,Jeff H.,5,Yes,12-Sep-14,-,0,"I stream movies, tv music. Store and listen to my entire music collection online. Store and view all my photos (hundreds) online.
Play games. Do puzzles. Online banking. Oh yeah, it's a very nice device."
B00DVFLJKQ,76,760,Best tablet I've had,moneill20,5,Yes,26-Jan-14,1,0,"This is my third type of tablet & by far worth the price. System moves very fast, never crashes, screen resolution is beautiful."
B00DVFLJKQ,77,761,A good tablet with host USB,John Bellinger,5,Yes,28-Dec-13,-,0,"The screen is gorgeous, it is a good size. Generally works well. Host USB mode is why i got this rather than a kindle fire. Wish I'd gotten the 4g version instead."
B00DVFLJKQ,77,762,Fabulous,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,20-Sep-13,1,0,"This gear-averse consumer finally caved and bought a tablet. I now have it with me almost all the time. It is an easy, reliable, slick device which I use as an adjunct to reading (check definitions, research names, events, issues), to listen to music (it plays music in my old model car without needing the auto sound system), to watch movies (no, the tiny screen is not a bother because the resolution is so good), to read the newspapers, and--I gave in completely--to play games. It's a great portable resource to have with you if you can't bear to waste time. For other late comers like me: there's a learning curve, but it's worth it. Also, my principle problem with tablets was my aversion to touch screens, but this one is not so sensitive as to be a problem in handling (unlike the other tablets I tried). A fabulous product at a great price."
B00DVFLJKQ,77,763,Awesome tablet,Carol Mak,4,Yes,09-Jan-14,-,1,"I compared this tablet with my friend's mini ipad, the speed is comparable and the camera is awesome.
It is a great give for anyone that need to surf the net provided there is wifi available. I bought the 32 GB, so I am still good with the space but really wish that it is able to expand with external storage card although can store in cloud storage but accessing is only possible if there is connection. Overall experience is great. 4.5 Stars actually."
B00DVFLJKQ,77,764,This needs 5 stars,Barb,5,Yes,02-Feb-14,-,0,I am very happy with this product and would recommend this one. Easy to learn to use. Perfect size. Not to big and not to small. I take it everywhere.
B00DVFLJKQ,77,765,Best 7 inch tablet on the market.,Jesse James Gill,5,Yes,17-Nov-13,3,1,"This Gen 2 definitely takes the cake over it's older sibling. I have been so pleased with the Asus Nexus 7 line. It does everything I need it to do. The Gen 2 is slimmer, thinner, lighter, and faster. I have experienced some lag and random freezing here and there, but nothing that I did not come across on the Gen 1. Couple the tablet with Nexus Media Importer ($4) and you can read and write to USB mass storage without the need to root the device. Add office, other productivity apps and a keyboard and this tablet can do just about anything my desktop computer can, besides gaming. Love it, love it."
B00DVFLJKQ,77,766,mostly in front of the TV or when travelling and this is perfect.,Orion940,5,Yes,04-Oct-14,-,0,"This is everything I expected it to be. I'm a casual user of a tablet, mostly in front of the TV or when travelling and this is perfect."
B00DVFLJKQ,77,767,lousy product,Rosie,1,Yes,23-Dec-17,-,0,This tablet has never worked to my satisfaction. The touchscreen responds poorly and I seldom use it due to that frustration. I should have returned it.
B00DVFLJKQ,77,768,fast responsive device,Ho Hwee Ling,5,Yes,03-Apr-14,2,0,"as per specifications, it manages my document reading easily and responds fast when I tap between apps. supports multi app tasking easily.
But here is one issue with the NEXUS 7, it is the charging time. The initial full charge takes around 4hr and now it is more than 6hr and it is only 80% charged. I wonder what is the experience like for the other users."
B00DVFLJKQ,77,769,Four Stars,Leah M.,4,Yes,16-Mar-16,-,0,Great tablet. Love the screen resolution.
B00DVFLJKQ,77,770,Nexus 7 2nd Generation is a Contender!!,RT,5,Yes,06-Jan-15,-,0,I bought one for my husband and one for myself for Christmas. The Nexus 7 second generation is such a great tablet!! We are enjoying all the great features. It is very easy to navigate. The screen color is so vibrant and clear. Great for movies and pictures. The surround sound is awesome!! It fits comfortably in my hand. Its just the right size. This tablet keeps you entertained and it is definitely worth buying.
B00DVFLJKQ,78,771,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,10-Nov-16,-,0,My favorite tablet

B00DVFLJKQ,78,773,Very pleased with this tablet,CDC,5,Yes,21-Feb-16,-,0,Very pleased with this tablet. Screen size is a bit smaller than I would like but it is otherwise perfect!
B00DVFLJKQ,78,774,Perfect size to still fit in some pockets.,R. Reinhardt,5,Yes,25-Jan-16,-,0,This is our fourth one. Great size. Amazing screen. Light and fast.
B00DVFLJKQ,78,775,2013 Nexus Tablet,joe doe,5,Yes,07-Sep-13,-,0,"Anyone looking for a 7"" tablet will not be disappointed!!!! Fast...beautiful display and clean android....although some issues have been reported mine has been flawless!!!!"
B00DVFLJKQ,78,776,TABlet...,Babatunde T. Ajidele,5,Yes,27-Feb-14,1,0,"a very practical, and functional tablet...just buy it and you will see. However be warned, you will not want to return it."
B00DVFLJKQ,78,777,Great 7-inch tablet on a budget!,Ernie T.,4,Yes,07-Nov-13,2,0,"I made the decision to purchase the 2nd gen Nexus 7 after a test drive on a display unit, and comparing it to other similar tablets from competing brands. This unit is easy to handle in one hand, and is perhaps one of the lightest tablets in the market. The display resolution is very sharp, comparable (if not better) to Apple's Retina displays. It is capable of video playback at 1080p Full HD. Music quality is reasonably good. This tablet also comes with stereo speakers, located at the top and bottom sides, which makes watching videos or listening to music quite enjoyable without using earbuds, although you would have to be in a rather quiet area. Apps load and perform fast, even when compared to my Samsung Galaxy S3 which also has a quad core CPU. Cable connectivity is via micro USB, so getting replacement cables will be easy.

Now, the weak points of the Nexus 7. Both front and back facing cameras are very average. The back camera is 5MP, and even in broad daylight outdoors, the quality of photos taken are not as good as other tablets. The camera app's auto focus is finicky, and seems to have trouble getting the right focus. The front camera is 1.2 MP, so needless to say, don't expect Full HD video conferencing. Compared to other brands, the Nexus 7 doesn't come with its own Task Manager, and File Manager, so if you need access to the file system or to view / kill running tasks, you would need to download the apps off Play Store. I felt that the default collection of apps to be rather ""bare"", but it isn't a deal breaker as earlier mentioned, many good 3rd party apps are available.

Note: I found out that the tiny hole next to the volume controls is actually the mic. So don't try using it for the ""hard reset"" function!"
B00DVFLJKQ,78,778,New Toy,mrbilll,4,Yes,01-Mar-15,-,0,"Enjoying it so far. It;s something new for me , so there is a learning curve but I'm getting there"

B00DVFLJKQ,79,782,I like the device,G. Gegelia,5,Yes,23-Dec-13,-,0,"It is fast, the screen is brilliant. Even though plastic design it is lighter and thinner than the older version. Back camera is also working well and is practical."
B00DVFLJKQ,79,783,The $200 brick!,Jonathan Washington,2,Yes,04-Jul-15,3,0,"When this works, it's pretty good. Note I said WHEN it works, because despite having purchased this in little under a year, my Nexus 7 has already been plagued by bugs and internal flaws. Screens that just stop working and needing a reboot. More notoriously I got plagued by the infamous ""Bricked"" problem where my Nexus 7 just rebooted out of nowhere and refuses to load past the Google loading screen, making my tablet a glorified paperweight. Again within a year! That's extremely sloppy Especially since a quick look around various forums indicate that this is NOT an uncommon occurrence. Google and Asus ought to be ashamed of themselves inconveniencing customers with their poorly-manufactured devices (AND for giving people the run-around when they try to get them repaired.)"
B00DVFLJKQ,79,784,Four Stars,Amazon Customer,4,Yes,19-Jan-16,-,0,Bought to operate my Drone. Does what I bought it for perfectly..

B00DVFLJKQ,79,786,We just really like them!,Tina LeHardt,5,Yes,20-Jul-14,-,0,"My husband and I both bought one for ourselves and we love them! We bought them to replace the older Nexus 7's that we have. These are more streamlined, faster, and I'm not a techy person, I just really enjoy using mine for email, movies, (I WISH they would come out with a version of FLASH player for the OS), and reading books."
B00DVFLJKQ,79,787,one of the best devices in recent years,Dale M. Schultz,5,Yes,17-Mar-15,-,0,"I cannot live without my nexus 7. Perfect size, great screen, good speed, good battery life."

B00DVFLJKQ,79,790,Whats not to like,Man,5,Yes,29-Aug-13,-,0,Fits in my pocket (men's) and goes everywhere with me. Right now it blows any tablet out of the water in its class. I haven't had any problems with it either.
B00DVFLJKQ,80,791,Nexus 7 2013,sar3000,5,Yes,30-Jul-13,3,0,"Comparison to previous Nexus 7.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
New speakers are much better. A++
Size is narrower and easier to hold. A++
Display is awesome.
Called Google for a question and basically the person said for support I needed to talk to ASUS and not Google. By purchasing this from Amazon you do not have support from Google. I find this a bit strange but maybe ASUS support is better anyway.
I received the product on Monday with free prime shipping after making my order on Saturday. Pretty amazing.
All the playstore apps transferred automatically and the amazon apps transferred easily once I figured out how to get appstore installed. I think you will be very happy with the new NEXUS 7 -2

Update after 30 days. Well finally Google fixed the problem with the GPS. Now everything works great. The battery life on GPS is way better than the first version."

This is my first tablet, so I find the battery life is superb, after 6 hours of usage, it dropped to 93% which I'm very happy with it! Keep up the good work Amazon and bring us more great products!"
B00DVFLJKQ,80,795,I like the size,Patrick,5,Yes,14-Feb-15,-,0,"I use this tablet a lot more than I ever thought I would. I like the size, not too big, but big enough to see."
B00DVFLJKQ,80,796,love this thing,lucky,5,Yes,04-Jan-14,-,0,no problems with it. works good and great graphics. no memory problems and ton of applications to install. do recommend a cleaner of some kind though.
B00DVFLJKQ,80,797,Best value tablet,Golan Bar Tal,5,Yes,30-May-14,-,0,"It seems I've found the perfect match of size, weight and performance.
This product works smooth and fast, the screen is just in the perfect size, not too large and not too small, and it weighs nothing.
If you are looking for a tablet to be used for a general aviation, this is defiantly the one!"
B00DVFLJKQ,80,798,Great tablet for reading e-books,doobs,5,Yes,18-Feb-16,-,0,Got this for Christmas. I love it..
B00DVFLJKQ,80,799,Excellent value,MV,5,Yes,07-Apr-15,1,0,"I've had this tablet since it first came out in mid 2013. Almost 2 years later this tablet is still performing terrifically. It has fallen to the ground more times than I can count, but not a single scratch or dent to be seen. Still holds up pretty well performance wise. Speed is great, the battery does not last as long as it used to, but Something to be expected from a almost 2-year-old device. The micro USB port has started to become a little frail and charging is a little finicky, but besides that -- and the slightly reduced battery life --the tablet feels just as when I first bought it. All-around a great purchase especially for the price, it is still my favorite gadget at the moment."
B00DVFLJKQ,80,800,This is a great tablet!,Harry Lime,5,Yes,07-Apr-15,1,0,I've had this tablet now for awhile and it's been faultless!
B00DVFLJKQ,81,801,Steeper learning curve,Anthony B. Johnson,4,Yes,29-Mar-14,-,0,"Please disregard last bum review! Thought unit was dead, but failed to hold 'on' button long enough.
My only caveat is that the Nexus has a much steeper learning curve and more study than say, the Nook.
A thousand pardons! I owe you guys a KowTow."

B00DVFLJKQ,81,807,Good choice,Mohamed Farouk,4,Yes,03-Oct-13,2,0,"As my first 7"" tablet, and also wifi-only unit, i wasn't 100% sure before i get it. but after i used it it came out to be a good choice. I really love the display of that thing, also the speed of the stock launcher along with the hardware specs makes the system very smooth and responsive.
I can say that now i love the size also, and any other modifications i might require should be added to the firmware.
The touch screen is having some issues as it some times adds a touch that u did not make (especially visible while typing on the keyboard), Google is supposed to solve that issue with the coming update but till now the issue is there and this is why it lost the fifth star."
B00DVFLJKQ,81,808,tablet,catjag,5,Yes,08-Jan-14,-,0,Ordered for my grandson's birthday. He had an older one like this but was thrilled to get the new one. Fast ordering and faster delivery.

B00DVFLJKQ,81,810,Great service from Amazon,Butch Huizinga,4,Yes,16-May-14,1,0,"The first Nexus 7 was slow and unresponsive. I had given it as a gift and the person that I gave it to thought that it was operating normally. After about two months we discovered that it was not functioning properly. Amazon, almost with out question had a new one on the way the same day that I phoned them. Thank you Amazon for the great service!!"

B00DVFLJKQ,82,816,Nexus 7 2013 - My first tablet,Craig,5,Yes,19-Feb-14,1,0,"Great portable and light weight tablet. My wife had the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 a couple years ago, and I did not like it. I feel as if the 7-inch is perfect for reading, catching up on my TV shows, and light web browsing. I wish there was an option to expand memory, though."

B00DVFLJKQ,82,819,Almost Perfect,Austin Gilliam,5,Yes,13-Dec-13,-,0,"This tablet is everything I expected it to be, and is damn near perfect for everything I do with it (organization, school, work, etc.). The only thing I can say it is lacking in compared to other tablets I've tried is it's stylus recognition. I've tried with a stylus I already had as well as a few friend's, and rarely does it do what I want it to, compared to my similar experiences with iPads and other similar technology. But overall, worth your money."
B00DVFLJKQ,82,820,Great device,John,5,Yes,27-Aug-13,-,0,"Very good device, fast. great screen good battery life. And stock android. Also the device is thin and light. Only complaint is that there aren't any highly protective cases out for it yet."

B00DVFLJKQ,83,822,A lot of Tablet in a small package,R Nance,5,Yes,08-Jan-14,2,0,"I bought 2 for my sons for Christmas. They were thrilled to get the tablets and love the fact that they aren't too big. I did a lot of research on the Nexus 7 before I bought it. I believe it is better than the Ipad Mini and the price can't be beat. The only thing that I am not crazy about is the camera. It doesn't seem to take crisp photographs or videos. The resolution when watching videos is fantastic and the speakers are pretty good as well. Overall, I would highly recommend the tablet if you're looking for a powerful device that is compact."
B00DVFLJKQ,83,823,the best tablet!!,Alvaro Martinez,5,Yes,26-May-14,-,0,"fast, powerful, really god design, i love the video quality, Google and asus rules, this is the best tablet that i used!"
B00DVFLJKQ,83,824,Nice Tablet at Good Value,CM Koh,5,Yes,23-Dec-13,-,0,"Pros:
- Incredible display
- Smooth operation
- Updates to Android 4.4.2
- Small and light
- Battery life is decent

Cons:
- Very basic camera
- Can get quite warm when playing games
- A few instance of auto-exiting games after a couple of hours of gaming

Despite some of the set backs, this tablet has already performed way over it's price point. Therefore, I think it deserves the 5 stars."
B00DVFLJKQ,83,825,pretty good,V. Kulkarni,4,Yes,03-May-14,1,0,So far so good - seems to be as advertised. Nice resolution touch and feel. Battery good too. What else to say?

Plenty of power, never experience any lag. Crystal clear display. Updated quickly when Google issues Android updates.

B00DVFLJKQ,84,835,Superb device,eastb,5,Yes,02-Apr-14,-,0,"I was torn between a 10"" and a 7"" tablet, I am now happy I made the right choice. It is much more portable, and apps are not designed for 10"". For the price I think it is terrific value , and I heartily recommend it to anyone."
B00DVFLJKQ,84,836,Indeed the best Android tablet!!!,gohhans,4,Yes,24-Dec-13,-,0,"Clear, sharp, focus, and fast!
Suffers no lag at all.

Cheap compare to other tablets found around the market for the same specs.

Only wish the screen were a little longer on the bottom ends. Screen is one inch smaller on the SIDE & BOTTOM compare to another available 7 inch tablet on the market."
B00DVFLJKQ,84,837,Nice but...,Lindy,4,Yes,15-Apr-14,2,0,"I really like my new Nexus, it's about as good as a tablet gets. My old 7"" tab was an Acer that was spec'ed similar to the first gen Nexus, this new one is smaller, lighter, and noticeably faster. The screen is beautifully impressive.

And now we come to the but...
This is my second new Nexus, the first one had to be returned due to a defective touch screen. The only reason I didn't take two stars off is Amazon's service. The replacement tab was on it's way to me before I could even get the old one to the post office to return it."

B00DVFLJKQ,85,844,Versatile,J,5,Yes,14-Aug-14,-,0,Love it! Nice and light. Small enough to throw in a bag and go (with a case of course). Large enough to read books on. Loving the dual cameras.

B00DVFLJKQ,86,852,Almost perfect!,Allen Tuh,4,Yes,23-Jan-14,-,0,"This is the smoothest Android device I ever used.
3D games run smoothly.
Display is very sharp and clear.
I removed 1 star because there is still minor glitches when zooming in Google Maps. I suppose this is the multi touch issue that plague this device since the very beginning. However this does not effect normal operation.
It is really worth buying because of its quality and affordability."

B00DVFLJKQ,86,855,Amazing. Well worth the price to get max memory,Laura Ngoh,5,Yes,16-Feb-14,1,0,"You can read the reviews online. Beats them all and even without an SD card slot, I'd still recommend it. Use Airdroid and file transfers are snappy. Response is great and screen detail is mind boggling. Fit great even in my small hands and a rugged case does not diminish it's ergonomic fit."

B00DVFLJKQ,86,859,"Despite alot of problems flying over the net, my unit is problems free~!",Kek Yun Yuan,5,Yes,18-Oct-13,-,0,"A simple search will yield many software or hardware issue that existed on the unit, however i receive it problem-free

The display is exceptionally great and the speed of the unit is equally marvelous.

Maybe the going-to-announced ipad will par the technical capabilities but they are not going to win nexus in term of pricing and the flexibility of android and Google had to offer."
B00DVFLJKQ,86,860,"Not an ipad replacement, but probably good for watching movies.",Richardb,3,Yes,10-Nov-13,4,0,"I purchased this for my wife since she needs a second ipad. It seems like a budget i-pad like device and has good reviews, and also having access to the apps on google play beats getting a kindle. However, the touch screen is much less sensitive than the ipad. We have to tap things several times often. When typing (and inevitable) editing on Evernote, the touch sensitivity is so random that the tablet ends up rearranging and cutting a bunch of texts! If you are looking for a ""pad"" for entertainment (movies, music), and just reading (without highlighting), this is fine. But if you are looking for a tablet that can do a bit more productivity type tasks, look elsewhere!"

B00DVFLJKQ,87,865,"Awesome Tablet. Clean, fast and easy to use.",Henry Mena,5,Yes,02-Nov-13,1,0,"If the 7"" tablet size is for you, do not hesitate to purchase this tablet. Although the 7"" tablet proved to narrow for my needs, as I use documents that are double columned, the tablet performance and display were perfect.

I appreciate that it did not come weighed down with useless stuff as so many manufacturers do with their devices.

The only drawback that I have with the Android operating system is the lack of a decent EPUB app. I guess I am just too spoiled with IBOOKS.

However, just speaking tablet, hands down an AWESOME tablet all around."

Both miss touch events, and the second one gets ""stuck"" touches, e.g., if you type, it will just repeatedly type on its own without you touching anything. Same behavior confirmed by YAMTT app from the Play Store. Contacted Asus, no technical solution is available beyond ""have you tried to reset to manufacturer's settings?"" They suggested that I return both items to the store, which is what I plan to do. What a shame, seems like a great device otherwise. I guess I am just incredibly unlucky..."

I travel often for work and use this tablet as an e-reader -- it works great for that purpose, especially in combination with an app like Twilight that adjusts screen brightness and color to prevent eye strain.

B00DVFLJKQ,90,899,Best tablet on the market now,Alextop,5,Yes,04-Dec-13,3,0,"This is by far the best tablet you can find on the market for the amount of money it costs.

**** Pros
- Fast Processor quad core I believe
- Google tablet - get the best software as soon as it is out
- Small factor (could be a con)
- Usually comes with some google store credit.
- Can do lots of stuff with it
-Price (huge plus)
- Great contrast ratio
- HD screen
- Rear camera

***Cons
-Some people do not like small factor - works fine for me
-Keyboards do not really go with the tablet - they work fine but screen is a bit small with it
- No expandable memory ( :( )"
B00DVFLJKQ,90,900,"Perfect, will be missed.",Gypsylea,5,Yes,19-Mar-15,1,0,"Very pleased. Does everything I wanted, size is perfect. Too bad this model is no longer made. The Nexus 9 is larger than I want and a good bit pricier."
B00DVFLJKQ,91,901,Awesome!,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,27-Aug-13,1,0,Even better than the Nexus 7 2012. I have fallen in love again! Amazing display and awesome stereo sound.. Worth every cent.

It's like having a computer where ever you go, providing you have Wi-Fi or a service to stay connected. I just would not do any banking, pay bills or purchase anything using a Tablet. For Google Email, pictures, music and looking up anything and almost everything it's GREAT."
B00DVFLJKQ,91,908,Five Stars,Minh Pham,5,Yes,26-Nov-15,-,0,Great tablet
B00DVFLJKQ,91,909,Great gadget,Ky,5,Yes,02-Nov-13,-,0,"This thing is FAR superior to the ASUS tablet I purchased last year. Much easier to manage its charging and need for that. I do not plan on needing to type much so the lack of ability to have a keyboard is not a problem. With Skype and Google on it it is all I could ever need as long as I can find a WiFi - not so hard these days. At home, with this and a Chromecast gadget (since my TV is not internet ready, being a couple years old) I can watch Youtube documentaries whenever I feel like it. Amazing how many great things there are available on Youtube if you search for History or such - even movies."
B00DVFLJKQ,91,910,Three Stars,book lover,3,Yes,31-Dec-14,-,0,Works fine. But the charger becomes no good really quick.
B00DVFLJKQ,92,911,touch screen problems,A reviewer in FL,2,Yes,26-Jul-14,1,0,"I've had this now for several years, and from the beginning, the touch screen was either not as responsive as I'd like when typing (I have to watch and frequently tap more than once on a letter), or it's too responsive (automatic double letters when typing). Because of that, I find the device difficult to use and I rarely use it. I love the size of it, but it's frustrating because it takes five times as long to type something because of the constant corrections that need to be made. It has so many good reviews though, so I wonder if I got a bad unit."
B00DVFLJKQ,92,912,"Awesome tablet, very happy owner",Susan Swiantek,5,Yes,21-Mar-14,-,0,"We have gone through 2 other tablets in our household that were nightmares. I will refrain from naming them. This tablet has been been 100 % awesome!! The touch, the battery life, the volume, all the important technical aspects make this perfect for us. I hate to even have a ""but,"" but if it was only all that it is but 8 inches instead of 7, I could have given it 5 stars plus!!!"

The seven inch is sized just right for viewing and portability. This tablet is fast, does everything I want it too, music, videos, pictures, review PDFs, spreadsheets and Word documents. Flip-board, gmail, Web browsing, well, everything. No issues what so ever, everything including the GPS works perfectly.

The one thing it really does well and I didn't expect, it attracts the Apple fanatics I work with. They are impressed and walk away wishing they had widgets."
B00DVFLJKQ,92,915,Love it!,L. Kotila,5,Yes,27-Aug-14,-,0,"Bought this for my 7 year old's birthday gift. I was debating between a younger computer game thing (Leappad, Innotab etc) and decided she'd outgrow that too fast. Bought this one because it was cheaper than an IPAD (which is what she wanted). I like this one. She uses it daily and it holds up well to her use. I go in periodically and ""clean it out"". She gets frustrated because to be online she needs Wifi and while traveling, she can't play everything she wants. I think she'll survive though. ha! It's a nice tablet and it's easy for me to use as well. We've watched a movie on an airplane and it's got a great picture!"

B00DVFLJKQ,93,921,Amazing Device!!,PUFU GONG,5,Yes,12-May-14,1,0,"I am a college student and I owned a Sony tablet S (sold) and an iPad mini (gave away) before, so I pretty familiar with tablets and all its strengths and weaknesses. I mainly use tablets for checking my class materials (pdf) and reading news, sometimes watching stream videos, and occasionally do some gaming. All I need is something that is in a fair price as well as easy to carry around. After I done some research online I decided to give the 2nd gen Nexus 7 a shot. It is on sale right now and has all those decent specs to meet my needs. For now, I have used it for about two weeks, and I should say that I absolutely love it! I keep it in my backpack every day to school and I just can't get my hand off it even when I am in bed. It runs so fast and so smooth, I enjoy using it to play the Real Racing 3 and Dear Trigger, and I really prefer watching live sports games on it. To keep this review short, I'll just list some pros and cons I thought about this little but powerful device.

Pros:
1. Amazing screen. I have put my friend's iPad Air side by side with this tablet; the display looks just as good as the so called ""retina"" screen if no better. Everybody should know here that although a ""retina"" iPad air has a 2048x1536 resolution which is indeed higher than the Nexus 7’s 1920x1200 but its pixel density is only 264, in contrast, the nexus 7 has a higher 323 ppi (pixels per inch), which means the Nexus has a sharper screen and you could tell once you play HD videos.
2. Great build quality. I think Asus is truly a good brand and they made some really great tablets (ex. Transformer book), and what they have done with the Nexus 7 is rather impressive. It is light and easy to hold, and I don’t see any place flimsy or bendable. The overall build quality is just top notch.
3. Fast performance. I don’t have to put the tech specs here to impress but honestly I think this tablet performance so well that for the first time I think the Android tablet is really catching up with the iPad: great UI and smooth performance
4. Running Android 4.4 KitKat. This is a nice addition if you purchase a google device, I know that the mainstream Android devices would get the 4.4 eventually but google device is no doubt where you get it first and fast.

Cons:
1. Battery life is unimpressive. To be fair, the battery life on Nexus 7 is good enough but not excellent. I understand that due to the size factor it can only pack a small size battery than an iPad does. Average 7-8 hours is still something that bothers me because after I play some none hi-spec demand games for a straight hour the battery would significant drops 18-22 percent (ex. Happy Store). However, if you only use it for reading news or jumping around some lifestyle apps (ex. Facebook) it would last longer than 8 hrs. And the good thing is if you put it in sleep mode it won’t make you lose too many drains (5% battery drops after a night without plug in outlet).
2. No SD card expansion. This is a huge disappoint since I have several SD card which hold my files that I need to access. And the 32 GB internal story is not that big you will soon find you are in a shortage after you download several high quality films and some big title games
All in all, I enjoy my experience on the Nexus 7 and I would like to recommend it to anyone who looking for a tablet with both portability and great performance."
B00DVFLJKQ,93,922,"Its an excellent tablet, very fast and easy to use",Roselena G.,5,Yes,18-Apr-15,1,0,"Its an excellent tablet, very fast and easy to use."
B00DVFLJKQ,93,923,Very difficult to set up with wireless network that is ...,Yenter,3,Yes,15-Jul-14,1,1,"Very difficult to set up with wireless network that is secured and requires MAC address; you can't access the device's MAC address until you set it up, but you can't set it up without accessing the network. The customer service rep suggested setting up the initial service at a public WiFi site, but certainly a pain."

B00DVFLJKQ,93,926,Awesome best buy. but that touch screen though. (Now reconsidered),Roland,1,Yes,22-Mar-15,1,0,"*UPDATE* Best device I've ever ownd. But! The touch screen has some really sickening issues. I hope if you're buying one that's it's in the batch that without this problem.

Update. I've bought a new one and it fixed all my issues. But added like two. The screen has some ugly burn in out straight out of the box. And the screen actually has less quality than my previously owned one with bad touch screen issues. But you wouldn't know unless you put them side by side. Other than that everything is fine.

*Update* six months on my battery is now swollen and protrudes. -_-

*Update* I now have 2 useless block of tablets.

DO NOT BUY. I REPEAT: DO NOT BUY!!!!"
B00DVFLJKQ,93,927,"Awesome for the price - display is bright and crisp, and the interaction is fast and smooth.",David F.,4,Yes,16-Oct-13,-,0,"Big fan - compared to the 32GB iPad of the same size @ $450, this for $260 is a steal. If you're in the market for a 7 inch tablet, this is as good as it gets right now.

My only gripe, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that I had to return the first one because it had 3 glaringly dead pixels. I've since read that seems to be a common enough problem that forums are polluted with complaints. Amazon is pretty amazing about returns though - they shipped my replacement before I even had time to box up the old one for sending back!

All in all, highly recommended."

My first tablet was a Kindle Fire however as I reside outside of the US I was unable to fully utilize all of the apps and functions the Kindle is capable of. For this reason I opted to get another tablet, after much research I decided on the Nexus 7. I love it, it's a great size, fits comfortable in one hand, battery life is pretty good (about 1-2 days depending on how often I use it and what apps are running). Apps are easy to install through the Google play store. I wish the volume was a little louder though. I use my tablet mostly for reading, playing a few games and surfing the net and it suits my needs."

B00DVFLJKQ,95,949,pros & cons,raynedae,3,Yes,17-Nov-14,-,1,"I miss my first gen Nexus! This one might have more memory, but I'm finding it to be a little unreliable. I'll click on a word from the predictive text and a totally different word will appear. Also, my first gen would fill in forms whether I was using my Hotmail address or my Gmail address. This one will only fill in if I'm using GMail. Very petty, Google! But 4X the memory is not to be sneezed at, I love that all my movies are downloaded all the time as well as my books & music. And the picture is much crisper as well. I could have purchased a 3d gen, but I didn't want a bigger device. All in all, a good value!"

However when i used it for around a week it started to have touch screen issue, after the update it became worst and when surfing web it will auto zoom in and out. and worst it will auto restart. After i have done a search on the web many people also have these problem that i have some even worst, it might be my luck but seeing quite a number customers experience the touch screen and auto restart issue, there must be some manufacturing issues with Asus. I have send back the nexus 7 and awaiting for a new one to come and hopefully it does not disappoint me again. As much as i would like to own this device if the problem still persist after the exchange i will just get an refund and buy another tablet."

I really love my nexus 7...till today, it suddenly can't be turned on. It kept displaying a black screen with the white text Google. I bought it in less than 1 month!
Another issue is the touch screen is not sensitive enough. I experienced some difficulties flipping pages when reading"

The text is very clear and sharp. This is a good tablet for reading books, which is more than I expected.

There is the one small curiosity where there isn't a camera app provided. You can readily download one for free, however."

I don't like the way the screen cover went on, too many air bubbles that were caused by probably lint or something that couldn't get off the screen. Wish I had had an extra one to try again, or let a professional put it on for me."

It offers a great speed boost in performance and the screen is much nicer. Also in my case an upgrade from 16GB to 32GB.

Only downside is the lost of Tegra HD games that won't run due to the change in CPU in the new model."

B00DVFLJKQ,100,997,Love it - my girlfriend loves it more!,shibut,5,Yes,03-Sep-13,1,0,"At the outset, I must admit that I own the original Nexus 7. One look at the images and reviews of the new one and I had to get it. In terms of looks and ""holdability,"" this new version has its older sibling beat. The resolution is jaw-droppingly clear and beautiful. I loaded up some pictures of a trip to Chicago and they look stunning. Jellybean 4.3 is snappier. I like the new placement of the headphone jack. I feel that the sound is better. This trumps the older ""7"" on every level (except that textured back) and that is saying something. At this present time, I do have to say that, in my humble opinion, this is the best 7 inch tablet on the market. Pick it up. At this price, you just can't go wrong. Accessories, though, are still not available. BTW, my girlfriend owns it now. I guess I'll have to buy one for myself!!"

Cons: It's been less than six months since I've purchased the tablet and half of the touch screen stops working occasionally. A reboot of the tablet tends to fix this temporarily, but this is a major deal breaker."

I don't care how good the display was if there is a dot that won't go away it kind of makes it useless. I don't wanna pay over $200 for a defected product.

Otherwise it was a great tablet, just wish it wasn't built so cheap."

B00DVFLJKQ,101,1009,Best 7 inch tablet on the market.,Pavel Lapaev,4,Yes,02-Nov-13,-,0,"32GB WiFi version, 1 month of active, every day use
I had Nexus 7 2012 edition for 10 months and as soon as the new Nexus 7 2013 was available in Russia I ordered one. The shipping took about 2 weeks and the service, provided by Amazon during that time was spot on.
It is a great improvement since the old Nexus 7 and it is definitely worth its money. Its amazingly fast, the screen is superb and I really like how speakers are positioned, the quality and volume if the sounds is great. Pure Andrioid is another reason to buy this tablet. Honestly, there are many reviews which will tell you why this is a great tablet, so I will focus in the negatives. There are two things, which made me give this product ONLY 4 stars.
First one is that when I lay my tablet screen up on tha table it doest perfectly touch the surface of the table. The top part (where the camera and flash are) seems to be 0.5-1 mm above the table. I checked a few other Nexus 7 in stores and it seems that I am just the unlucky one. It doesnt affect the performance and day-to-day use in any way, but sometimes I remember about it and it ruins the perfection of the tablet.
Second reason is that the middle right part of the screen (portrait view) is not working perfectly when it comes to gestures. It is a bit off, making some tasks a bit harder. Again, not something that affects the usual routine, but a couple times a week it appears on the radar."
B00DVFLJKQ,101,1010,"well priced, fast and fun",PRay,5,Yes,17-Jun-14,-,0,Looked for awhile and finally jumped in. Great tablet that is fast with plenty of room 32g. Only addition would have been a micro sd storage slot.

B00DVFLJKQ,103,1025,Good ol' Nexus,Piquant,4,Yes,27-Nov-15,-,0,"I broke my first-generation Nexus 7 and I was debating for a long time how to replace it. The popular 9+-inch tablets are too big, but it seems that the other 7- or 8-inch tablets have various problems that the Nexus doesn't have. For example, the Kindle Fire seems rather locked-down, and one of the best things about my first-generation Nexus 7 was that I could eventually install SlimKat on it, significantly increasing its speed.

In the end, maybe this was really too expensive for the hardware that I'm getting. I don't know. I'm still pretty happy with it. It's basically the first-generation Nexus 7, but a little lighter and faster. I carry it around all the time. I often find myself holding it on my arm while I'm doing other things. That's the great thing about 7-inch tablets: they're really light and portable."

B00DVFLJKQ,107,1069,The Best of Google in a Fantastic Device,Gus,5,Yes,30-Jul-13,5,0,"Google has made this year's Nexus 7 tablet a very worthy upgrade over the previous model. Starting at $229, this year's model is $30 more expensive but makes up for it in every way possible. How did Google do this and maintain a great price? Let's find out.

I purchased the 32GB version on Amazon.

The Nexus Program
The Nexus program consists of high quality hardware, timely software updates, and low cost. It really started with the 2012 Nexus 7 as it sold at or a little above the cost it took to make it. Google wants these products in your hands in order for you to use the many services it provides. They make money on ads so the more you use Google the more money they make. They can afford to sell the device at close to cost in order to sell devices because it results in you using all the services Google has to offer.

Build
The Nexus 7 2013 is a well made device. It is easy to hold in one hand and is thinner and lighter than last year's model. It fits right into your back pocket and feels like its the perfect size. It is completely black as 2012 version had a silver ring surrounding the edges. It has Gorilla Glass on the front, a matte finish on the back and is a bit taller than the previous Nexus 7. You get a MicroUSB port on the bottom, a power button and volume rocker on the right side along with the microphone, and the 3.5mm headphone jack at the top. The new Nexus 7 also has dual back facing stereo speakers that produce sound of great quality and volume. The bezels on the side are smaller than the older N7 and the bezels on the top are larger resulting in a slightly taller device. The bezels don't bother me as much as others as I find it helps when holding the tablet in landscape. Overall, it is a very good looking tablet and a well built device.

There are two cameras on the device. A 1.2 Megapixel front facing camera and a 5 MP rear facing camera. Both are good but not great. The rear camera takes clear and decent pictures but doesn't have flash and won't replace your current point and shoot camera or your high end phone. The front facing camera is great for Google Hangouts but not for much else. Tablet cameras are there for convenience but not to become your go to shooter.

Display
The display is a full HD IPS display at 1920x1080p up from the 1280x720p display in the previous generation. While the original Nexus 7 had a good display at the time, this display is better in every way. The resolution makes everything clearer and sharper. All text is easier to read which makes reading an ebook an absolute joy. The screen is brighter and colors pop. Overall, the screen destroys all small tablet offerings currently on market. But don't take my word for it, see it for yourself and compare it to others. (iPad mini has 163 pixels per inch while the New Nexus 7 has 323 ppi. MAJOR difference in quality. Nexus 7 2012 had 216 ppi)

Internals and Performance
The new Nexus 7 runs on a 1.5 Quad Core Snapdragon S4 Pro using Krait 300 cores. What this means is that its a slightly weaker processor than the one(S600) found in the new HTC One and Galaxy S4(actually more like an under-clocked version of the S600) . This is a great upgrade over the previous Tegra 3 processor and it shows. Everything is quicker to open, runs more consistently, and there are fewer slowdowns. This was especially apparent when installing apps and not present in the new model. The 2GB of ram is plenty to ensure multitasking runs well. This tablet files by all other similar sized tablets.

All the normal connections are present such as WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, Wireless Charging(Qi) and soon LTE. Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy is also supported due to Android 4.3. Which leads us to...

Software
This is Nexus device so that means faster and more consistent updates as well as long support by Google. And right out of the box we are running Android 4.3 with a few small updates being required as you connect to WiFi for the first time. This updates enables TRIM which is a garbage collector that extends the life of your internal storage and reduces slowdowns. This was a major problem in the previous version and its very nice that Android supports it natively. This means you will likely get a performance boost in everyday usage on your original Nexus 7. On the user side there is Profiles. Profiles allow you to creates different profiles for different people so that each one has a unique setup and experience on the tablet. Want a different home screen for your significant other? No problem. Want to block app purchasing and certain apps so your child can use your tablet? Go right ahead. Since this is still Jelly Bean, it includes all the great additions such as Project Butter which makes everything much smoother and Google Now which acts as an assistant that tells you information when you need it.

Battery
The battery itself is a 3950mah battery which is smaller than last year's 4345mah one. Since the newer S4 Pro processor is more efficient this results in a very similar result. I got about 5 and a half hours of on screen time of heavy use on the original and about the same on the newer one. Obviously it matters how you use your tablet but rest assured that you won't be reaching for your charger in the middle of the day. I also noticed that it uses little to no energy while in sleep/standby.

You may dislike...
- No expandable storage. 16GB or 32GB
- Large top and bottom bezels
- Notification LED is not multi-color
- Good but not great cameras

Conclusion
Overall there is just no comparison at the 7 inch form factor. The closest thing would be the original Nexus 7 or the larger Note 8 but this has a better screen, processor, support, and build quality. At $229 for the 16GB and $269 for the 32GB, this tablet is a great value and is the best small tablet you can get right now."

One complaint about the nexus devices. Why will the device let me shoot a 16:9 video, but photos are 4:3? Makes no sensme to me. But since I don't use my tablet to take pictures, that did not affect my rating.

B00DVFLJKQ,108,1079,"Light, fast and gorgeous",Lichi W.,5,Yes,29-Aug-13,2,0,"Tablets never really appealed to me.

Thought iPad 1 was a glorified iPhone. Bought an iPad 2 but only used it to run a pet game to entertain my cat (I'm serious) and ended up selling it.

But if you are like me, a frequent business traveler who's looking to combine light productivity and entertainment – by that I mean reading, especially Kindle, and watching video – this is the best device. It's big enough but not overwhelming, light and thin enough to wield almost effortlessly, and it's fast and super responsive. Now I move around the house holding it instead of my MacBook Air.

For the price tag it's really a no brainer.

Lastly, if I didn't have it now, I would wait for the LTE version to come out. So you might want to take data connectivity into consideration."

I initially wanted a 12 inch however i soon realized that portability is what i really needed and this tablet has really fit the bill. I often carry it in my jean pockets or side cargo pant pockets. I can't tell you much about screen resolution, speed or overall performance due to the fact that i have only own one other tablet (Galaxy tab2 12 inch). They are both great tablets. If I were to redesign this tablet i would have made the power and volume switches a little more accessible.

Don't get me wrong, I like the Kindle, but I wasn't a big fan of how tied you are to just using Amazon for everything, even though there are ways around that. All I can say is that I'm so happy that I decided to go with the new Nexus 7. It's fast, powerful, the screen resolution is absolutely amazing. As of yet, I have no complaints with my purchase. I haven't had any problems running any format video, even though I must admit that I am using Dice Player. Games are running flawlessly. The texts on books are crystal clear. The biggest choice I had to make was whether to go with the 16 or 32GB version. I'm glad I spent the little extra money for the 32GB model. Way more room for movies and tv shows. As of right now, I'm one very satisfied customer!"
B00DVFLJKQ,111,1105,"GREAT tablet, if one can avoid the Quality Control issues!!",nom de plume,4,Yes,07-Sep-13,3,4,"Updated Review - 9/12/2013
**********************************************************
Updating from 1 star to 4 stars - one star shy of perfection because of the QC issues.
**********************************************************
Amazon true to form has replaced my defective unit, and my new one has so far performed flawlessly. Repeating anything I did the first time that would cause a freeze-up or reboot resulted in nothing more than showing me what a beautiful device this is when it functions properly.

That being said, after spending untold hours on the Google forum for the random reboot/freezes/crashing issue, it seems the bottom line is there are units that are defective. If you get one - return it for a replacement. If you got one from Amazon - good news, the replacement is painless (because Amazon is just that awesome.).

Looking at the reviews for this product - one can see (as of this writing) approximately 10% of the reviewers got a bum tablet. That's a pretty high percentage - however, it means the odds are in your favor for getting a good device.

Stable, fast and incredible resolution - - take a chance and get this tablet.
And if you fall into the 10% group - don't screw around with it, replace it immediately.
I think it's totally worth the risk, and the minimal hassle of a return.

If anything changes - I will update this review.
(original review of malfunctioning device below)

**********************************************************
ORIGINAL REVIEW - 9/7/2013
**********************************************************
This is my first Nexus tablet. I have to tell you, I was so excited to get this, I couldn't sleep the night I ordered it.

It arrived today, and I couldn't get it out of the package quick enough! I read the material, and off I went. Set up Wifi, my Google account... downloaded some free apps. Thought I should try Google Earth... CRASH.

My thought that it was just an aberration was quickly dismissed as the ensuing crash filled hour ensued. Troubleshooting online with various ideas for fixing it (turn off GPS. Clear GPS cache. Updated system software. Factory Reset. Send a bug report because Google doesn't know what's wrong, either!) all failed, ending in the inevitable CRASH (oh look, the crash - has it been less than 5 minutes again already??)

I may give this the obligatory weekend before returning it, but I have very little hope of a resolution here. I either have a lemon, or this is the worst JellyBean version ever!!!!! Whatever the reason, this device is beyond irritating or even just a bad design - - it is LITERALLY UNUSABLE!

If anything changes for the better, I will update this review. As it stands, 1 star is too good for this device, at ANY price, even free.
****************************************************
3 hours later:
I am returning this device for a replacement. Nothing I do will make this device stop crashing and actually do ANYTHING for longer than 4 or 5 minutes. If it is a lemon and the next one is good, I will update this review and the rating for the new device only."

B00DVFLJKQ,113,1126,"Me love you, but not for long time ;p",Kindle Customer,4,Yes,26-Mar-15,4,0,"Let me start off by saying I love this tablet! My kids have Samsung tab 3 & 4...It blows the tab 3 out of the water and is faster and I prefer the keyboard setup to the tab 4. The nexus was my first tablet and it was love at first sight!

Beautiful screen, nice battery life, fast switching between apps, lots of tabs open in the browser and it doesn't lag.

I purchased this tablet in Oct 2013 by early March of 2015 the battery started overheating, not holding a charge and draining fast, the charging port started malfunctioning it got so bad it would no longer charge...I have used this tablet constantly up until the problems started
I bought an extended warranty *square trade was worthless repairing it* they admitted to never repairing the charging port, the replacement battery still didn't hold a charge and they put a cheap screen on it, which had a dark spot in the corner, wavy unclear picture when scrolling text and pictures and other assorted issues...after a long drawn out battle I finally got a full refund.

While the tablet worked it was awesome! I'm not sure what the life expectancy should be so I took one star off for the battery and charging port issues.

Now I'm stuck deciding if I should order another one and have to replace it again in 1 to 1 1/2 years since reading other reviews the battery and charging issues are a known problem. I was really hoping they would have a new version of this tablet since some games/apps won't work with this tablet (outdated hardware?) No matter what I choose as a replacement I would not recommend squaretrade for a warranty. They will not repair with comparable parts!! This isn't the first problem I've had with them I'll no longer give them my business. I'll be giving canopy warranties a try now.

Conclusion- Great tablet while it works but not long lasting. Definitely worth having a warranty for the price. I'd buy another one in a heartbeat if they put a newer version out. Mainly for a fix on the charging port, battery, and newer hardware for being compatible with new apps and games that this model isn't compatible to play/use

So far my replacement considerations would be the nexus 8, Nvidia shield, If anyone has any input since all seem to have ups and downs I'd greatly appreciate it..."

With that said, the product is fast as ever, which is why I gave it 2 stars at the minimum instead of one (for this reason coming up).

After only 2 days (delivered Friday afternoon) it is now the morning of Sunday, and after exploring many different apps to install on this (I even got an emulator to work from dying to play good old games), I had noticed some weird color blotches on the screen when it tried to display a perfect black background. Immediately, I went to search up this problem on the internet, and found out that I am not the only one in this position.

After only having this product for 2 days, and using a screen testing app to find out where the dead pixels were, I found 6 blotches of pixels in groups/clusters right next to each other, about the size of half a dime in width, where color was completely off, and even with a black screen, they attempt to show the colors of blue to green in a light hue.

What flabbergasts me the most is the fact that I had only received this product 2 days ago, and I am already seeing dysfunctions in the quality of my screen.

I hope I can get a replacement from Amazon quickly to deal with this, because even for a calm person such as myself with almost no OCD, I still get my eye drawn to the blotches of pixels that are displaying different colors than what they are supposed to show."

B00DVFLJKQ,114,1139,Very please with Nexus 7 Tablet,Sankaran Subramaniam,5,Yes,24-Dec-13,-,0,"Proabably the best 7"" tablet around. Kitkat is great. Since it is a Google device you get the latest updated software. Screen resolution and display is phenomenal. Very light and fast. love it"
B00DVFLJKQ,114,1140,Love it!,T. Chang,4,Yes,08-Oct-13,3,0,"Great Android device! The screen is sharp and bright, the weight is just right to use as a one handed device. Perfect device for what I use it for (reading emails, browsing online, reading e-books, using reader). But the only drawback is that the battery life is not that great for some reason. With it kept on 24 hours a day, maybe a charge is required every two or three days - this is in comparison to an iPad 3rd Gen where it can be kept on 24/7 and last much longer. I can only assume that the battery capacity is much larger in the 3rd Gen."
B00DVFLJKQ,115,1141,Absolutely love it!,DaveC,5,Yes,25-Sep-13,-,1,"This is a fantastic little tablet that is leaps and bounds better than the 2012 nexus 7. My fiance has the older 7 and this one trumps it in every way. It's thinner, lighter, faster, more responsive, and the display is much more vibrant and beautiful. I tether the 4G connection from my phone to the nexus on my morning train commute to work and it's fantastic. Only think I'd like is the option to add an external SD memory card but I can manage with 32GB. Good job Asus!"

B00DVFLJKQ,116,1156,"GPS, touch and sleep/wake issues",cmartin,3,Yes,21-Aug-13,4,0,"The longer I use the Nexus 2013 the more issues I seem to be discovering.

Since the day I received this device I have had sporadic issues with the touch screen (e.g. sometimes being to touch the screen many times in the same spot before getting a response). Yesterday was the first day I used GPS for more than a few minutes and, yes it did freeze and require a reboot. Today I experienced multiple issues with my cover which has never failed to wake up the device when the cover was opened. For 2 out of every 3 attempts I needed to use the power button to wake the device, and after about 30 minutes it started working correctly again.

The screen, form factor and battery life (4.3?) are a great improvement over the first generation Nexus 7. In spite of that, I believe that I will soon decide to return my new Nexus 7 for a refund. What else might go wrong?!

BTW I really do believe either Google or Asus or both should have spoken by now and I can't help but personally faulting them for their silence."

We also have an iPad Mini, and the only time it's really used is when our kids want to watch a movie on it that we have on iTunes. That is pretty much the only thing that the Nexus can't do, play iTunes movies. This has become my go to tablet. I also like the size better than the iPad mini, it fits in my suit pocket or in my front pocket in my slacks with the case on it, I can't do that with the iPad mini."

I have found it very easy to navigate and use. Best of all it was compatible with my other android devices. I have no complaints so far. I only gave it four stars due to the fact that it doesn't support Adobe Flash Player. This makes it more challenging to use some features that I would have liked to have had, such as watching streaming videos from my Amazon Prime account or viewing certain magazines that I have access in other venues. (All of which I was aware of before purchasing). But for the price it is still an awesome deal and I am still very happy with the purchase."

The screen is beautiful and video on it is great. The high pixel per inch and resolution are definately noticable and I love the 16:9 screen format. Watching most videos (which are in 16:9 format) just fits the screen so much better and looks better than on my iPad 3rd Gen. Even with the screen of the iPad (which is great), the loss of so much screen real estate going from 4:3 to 16:9 makes it looks so small."
B00DVFLJKQ,119,1184,All you could need,Andrew J. Delgado,4,Yes,06-Apr-14,2,0,"The size of this tablet is perfect for my on the go city life and I can not stress that enough. I think if you go bigger you might as well get a laptop...

Pure Google is where it is at, very easy and responsive to use. I mainly use it for casual web browsing and watching movies and tutorials on the go or at home with chromecast, the device handles every aspect and doesn't seem to lag or wait time to nothing noticeable which is nice. Wish I could squeak out a little more life of the battery but that's just nit picking now.

And yes cliche - Best bang for the buck for sure. I don't spend a lot on personal gadgets but I know I already made a good choice in buying it over any other tablet out there."

B00DVFLJKQ,119,1188,Great...for now at least,SB,4,Yes,01-Sep-13,2,1,"So I am like most people, I have been hesitant to buy this tablet because of all the problems it had. When I saw that google released an update that would fix these problems, I felt confident that google is in fact looking into the issues and trying to fix them. So far, I must say it is exactly what I was looking for. I needed a not so big or expensive tablet that had pretty good hardware specs that can handle heavy gaming and 1080p video and this tablet handles it extremely well. I tested my emulators and google play games on the highest graphical level and worked with no problem. If you need a decent gaming tablet with impressive specs, this tablet hits that spot considering it doesn't pass over $300

I think the only annoying thing about the tablet has to do with its brightness(if anyone could help I will appreciate it!) I put my brightness settings low and when I put my tablet to sleep and wake up again or sometimes when randomly scrolling on the home screen..the brightness goes up by a little bit without me changing it, also I don't use the auto-brightness but even with it on, I saw when I put to sleep and wake up again, the brightness resets to a brightness I did not put. Don't know if(and I really hope it is!)this is a software issue within android 4.3 that will be fixed soon or (I really hope not!)a hardware problem within my specific tablet model but it gets me annoyed that the brightness changes when I'm trying to save as much battery as possible and don't even have the auto feature on...(also no flickering, so its not that problem other people have experienced)

This little brightness problem is not that bad and can live with it, in fact I am looking into an app that better controls the brightness. But still it is something I would like fixed. Other than that, its a great tablet with power."

I had the first generation of the Nexus 7, and it's safe to say that this tablet is just on a different ball game. Not only is the tablet's battery superior, but the table it two to three times superior in performance. This tablet never fails to perform, so I always find myself using it on the side while doing other things. This tablet performs decently snappy with today's standards and is worth every penny. Unless you are either a spec maniac or just want the latest thing out, this table WILL NOT disappoint you."

The package delivered in perfect shape.

Nexus 7 2013 is blazing fast, very smooth and responsive it has pure version of android without all the crap ware you used to have in other android tablets, the tablet material is well done and you can feel the Strong plastic they have used, the screen has a warm colors and kinda greenish but it's so clear and beautiful and very crispy thanks to the 300ppi screen.

In short words it's high end device and for just then 229$

I see most people not taking in cost of ownership into the equation, yes apple might be the leading brand, but how much does it really cost to own one taking into consideration the number of apps you have to buy just to make it functional enough? another thing i wanna point out is how intuitive android jelly bean feels, its as if it was adapting to human movements, not the other way around. i don't mean to offend anyone I just want to share how much I am impressed with this device. Try out other tabs using the same OS, it doesn't feel quite right. this tab is just right for me since i use it for both work and at school."

It had issues with recognizing touches are various parts of the screen. I sent it back. I didn't want to go through the process of trying another and another hoping I could get a good one.

I have two Nexus 4's (one for my wife) and the original Nexus 7. The positive is that they are cheap, the negative is that you get what you pay for."

After a while it slowed down and became less useful. The 4.3 update seems to have helped, but I got this one and there's no looking back. It's super fast, the sound is almost as good as on my HTC One, and it screen is rivaled by no other device I've owned. It's a great upgrade and Google/ASUS knew what they were doing. Now the MTP/PTP may cause some issues with advance users, but there are always ways around it. If you're considering buying this device, do it now."

B00DVFLJKQ,125,1247,Great 1st tablet,Ranjan Shakya,5,Yes,07-Sep-13,1,0,"This is the first review I've ever written on here and I think the Google Nexus 32 GB tablet is the perfect one to write about. This is my first tablet and after doing a lot of research figured that this was the best choice for the money.
First off, Amazon delivered this puppy to me in 2 days even though I chose standard shipping which is awesome because as soon as I got it I started playing with it. The tablet feels really light but still good quality. Having played with my friend's iPad mini, the mini feels better, but the nexus is definitely not far behind in terms of build quality. The nexus us smaller than the mini but that's not that huge of a deal. If the .9 inch difference in screen size is just too much, then it's better to go with the mini I guess.
I had read that the screen was very high quality, but having never experienced a tablet before I didn't know what to expect. Let me say that I was blown away. The only tablets that I have to compare against are the iPad mini and the old Google Nexus. Having played with it for a little bit, I can say that it is better than both of them. The picture looks much better and details look much finer. Overall the screen flat out beats the competition.
Having no prior experience with the Android OS, I can say I am still quite pleased with it. Compared to iOS, Android seems more user friendly and I like the fact that the Nexus comes with the latest version of it. Android may not have as many apps as iOS but having looked through a few hours of the Google Play Store, there seems more than enough to occupy the time and all the basic ones are definitely there.
All in all, I want to say that I think I made the right purchase with this device. It's only been a few hours and I am already in love with this tablet. Hopefully as time goes on, it doesn't start to disappoint. I don't anticipate that happening, so I am pretty dang happy with this purchase.

Update (three years later):

This tablet is still going strong after three years of constant usage. The screen on mine cracked about a year into it. The crack runs along the upper left side of the screen which means there is no touch response in that part of the screen but does not affect the video at all. Overall, the tablet has been a beast for three years and at this point I am used to the cracked screen. It was the best tablet at the time that I bought it and is still pretty good three years later. You can't say that about a lot of tech these days. Good job Google."

B00DVFLJKQ,125,1249,Best tablet out there,Dalmatian Hunter,5,Yes,11-Jan-14,1,0,"I was putting off getting a tablet for quite some time. Those bigger tablets are just too bulky and cumbersome. This 7'' model is a perfect alternative. I am getting used to reading ebooks now. If you are used to an Android interface, this tablet is for you because you'll already know how to operate it. Plus, it's Google. And Google rules the world. Apple sux."

Had this device for a week now and used it on a very long journey to Asia loaded up with games and movies. Absolutely fabulous device and for the price, it's about to shake this ups. Crisp graphics, fast processor and great battery life."
B00DVFLJKQ,126,1254,Love this tablet,Stewie'smom,5,Yes,08-Mar-14,-,0,"I had been looking for a tablet for a while. I was comparing and wondering what I should buy when I came across the Nexus 7. I really like the tablet. It was easy to use, from the beginning. I didn't want to spend the money to get an Apple product and am now glad I didn't. This tablet has everything I need and has a ton of apps to choose from. The only negative I can find is that is does not let you open videos because it is not Adobe friendly. I like the fact that Nexus 7 32GB is the same or less than other tablets with only 8 or 16 gb."
B00DVFLJKQ,126,1255,The tab is amazing!!,Marc van Leeuwen,4,Yes,19-Jul-14,-,0,"The tab is amazing!!!
My only criticism is the availability of accessories such as covers and sleeves.

My husband did manage to shatter the screen after carrying it around in his backpack without a case on it. He bought the pieces to replace the screen, which proved somewhat difficult, but he again has a functioning tablet (and a case on the way)."

Text looks sharp, images are true to life, and the contrast is just about right to produce true colors. Everyday tasks and switching between apps is blazing fast and you would hardy notice any stutters. This can be a very good for reading, gaming and web surfing. very light weight and easily fits my pant pockets. I do everything on this tablet and use my phone for messaging and for phone calls.

You can surf the internet, watch movies, make Skype calls, play games, and do all sorts of other things online. I'd put this somewhere between a phone and a laptop or workstation.

My favorite thing to do with this tablet is to do video calls with my family far away. The screen is larger than my phone, which makes the experience much better."

Google Play store provides access to the full range of Android apps."
B00DVFLJKQ,128,1278,Like a lot,LisaB,5,Yes,07-May-14,2,0,"This has been a great buy. While my phone is the best resource when I'm on the go, this tablet has a lot more room and a much bigger screen for reading web pages and books, playing games, and using apps. The only problem I run into periodically is that the screen freezes, but a re-start quickly fixes this. The bluetooth and wireless features work very well. It's not heavy and easily fits into my backpack."

Out of the box the set up as easy, however the forced closing of many games during play and more importantly the screen interaction is extremely frustrating. I have to push a button 3, 4, and sometimes up to 5 times to get a response. The screen resolution is excellent but the lack of response from the touch screen and forced stopping is not worth the headache. I am sending it back."

As a techie who actually pays attention to things like mAh, processors and pretty much every detail in these toys I have to say this is the best tablet I have ever used. I've played with Samsung's and iPads for countless hours and they are plauged with slow speeds. Small batterys. Slow charging times. Compared to someone who just bout a brand new galaxy note. My nexus will charge 40% by the time her galaxy will charge 17% and it lasts absolutely forever. I am flying cross country on a weekly basis abd this tblet stands up to the constant abuse from movies and bluetooth streaming. I could not possibly be any happier with my choice of tablet."

What more can I say--Nexus' are great; you can have several apps open at one time and go back and forth between them (you can't do that with a lot of other tablets).

I bought a rooCASE for it and it slips into my purse just fine so I can have it with me. It is awesome for reading, and handles games well too. The battery life is acceptable; so far I have charged it about every day and a half; or every day with heavy usage. It was fun to customize (love the Android widgets) and set up. Don't hesitate to grab one of these things before they're all gone!"

B00DVFLJKQ,136,1352,Nexus Dream,A Bean,5,Yes,07-Dec-13,2,0,"I love that the Nexus streamlines many of the Google features I use, particularly chats/hangouts, the calendar, and my email. It works really smoothly and I'm impressed with the battery life. It also has a nifty feature: swipe from the bottom of the screen up and it can show you the traffic conditions, the weather forecast, and events in the area. I didn't exactly like the size of the screen for trying to type, either landscape or portrait, but then I discovered that you can swipe from one letter to another ot spell. That can be clunky if you're using just your finger. Overall, I use this on a daily basis and it has worked like a dream!"
B00DVFLJKQ,136,1353,Best tablet around,thiago37,4,Yes,30-Dec-13,-,0,"This is an awesome product, thinner, lighter and faster than last year's model. Gorgeous display, great UI with Android KitKat."

B00DVFLJKQ,136,1356,and it was great. No problems,Trish,3,Yes,03-Dec-14,-,1,"I had the first Nexus 7, and it was great. No problems. I gave it to my sister for her birthday so I could get the new one. I am not so happy with that decision. Although this is everything the other one was plus HD, it has frozen up three times. The first two times I held down the power and volume buttons, and after the reset it worked. Last weekend I had to go back to factory default. It worked but I had to put everything back in it. I would like to think it won't happen again, but I am not convinced of that. I hope they can come up with an update that will fix this problem, because I am not very happy with it. Other than that, it has a great picture, good audio, and it is way more versatile than the kindle or ipad. It is possible to put your own movies and music on it."
B00DVFLJKQ,136,1357,LOVE IT!,Bill Slawson,5,Yes,05-Nov-13,1,0,"Vivid color and clearity is excellent. It is very fast, lightweight and compact. Plan to buy another soon. Excellent product."
B00DVFLJKQ,136,1358,I absolutely love the Nexus 7 FHD Tablet,Alvin,5,Yes,30-Aug-13,2,0,"I've used this for almost 2 weeks.
The Nexus 7 FHD is light and sleek. It looks really good!
The speakers are gooooood.
Gaming and browsing the web had been really enjoyable with the super clear and beautiful screen.
It fits into the back pocket of your jeans (without any protective cases)

Battery life could have been better.
Top and bottom bezel could have been slightly smaller.
Should have included proximity sensors for the Wifi versions of the Tablets."
B00DVFLJKQ,136,1359,Awesome Tablet,DESI-ANN OLLIVIERRA,5,Yes,30-Mar-14,1,0,Just as I was expecting it to be. The speed of this tablet is so incredible. I would recommend this to everyone I know.

B00DVFLJKQ,137,1364,Five Stars,William Tell,5,Yes,16-Jan-15,-,0,Replaces previous unit that crapped out in less than two years. No warranty support from Google or Nexus.
B00DVFLJKQ,137,1365,Go for it!,E.G.C. Verheijden,5,Yes,19-Nov-13,1,0,"Probably the only downside to the Nexus is the absence of an SD-card slot. 32GB is adequate, but there is no such thing as too much storage space. Other than that, I'm loving it!"
B00DVFLJKQ,137,1366,Much improved,The Paz,5,Yes,02-Aug-13,-,1,"I had the old Nexus 7 and was initially very pleased but it sure did slow down. I understand that has been fixed with the 4.3 update. This new N7 is a huge improvement. It not only works much faster than the previous model, but it it slimmer and nicer to hold. It feels like quality and is greatly improved. Much improved screen, sound and overall performance makes this worth the upgrade."
B00DVFLJKQ,137,1367,Nexus 7,Dog &cat1,5,Yes,23-Dec-13,-,0,i love it. it works just fine and it's just right for my hands. i just wish that my case that i ordered will hurry up and get here. Lol.
B00DVFLJKQ,137,1368,"Weak screen, good device",Erwick D'Souza,3,Yes,09-Dec-14,-,0,The screen cracked ON IT'S OWN six months back. No warranty will cover it. My time's up anyway.

B00DVFLJKQ,137,1370,charging port is junk,Richard McClellan,1,Yes,27-Jan-15,2,0,"Great tablet but USB charging port is junk. Mine is down to only one or two of my many chargers that will connect at all and then only if you prop them just right.
Five star tablet with an eBay connector. For $200+ you should get at least a nickel connector. The thing is useless if you can't charge it."
B00DVFLJKQ,138,1371,A very crisp and handy Tablet,Ruturaj Anand Chandpur,5,Yes,19-Nov-13,1,0,"Very handy and fits well into my palm. Quite right size for children to use.

B00DVFLJKQ,138,1373,Upgrade from Original Nexus 7,Craig Seabrooks,5,Yes,11-Oct-13,-,0,"This is nice and thin and the screen is awesome. I wish I had the time to give a more detailed review, but I will tell you if you have/had the original, this is like light years better! The screen is gorgeous, it's fast, the battery LASTS!!!! and I think the shell is of much better construction which is saying alot since the OG was constructed nice, but I hated that brown!"
B00DVFLJKQ,138,1374,It is totally worth it.,Flavio Cotillo,4,Yes,04-Feb-14,-,0,After a few weeks of using it I haven't had any problem with it. The tablet works exactly I expected it would be. The battery life is good and the table is really fast even with different opened apps.

B00DVFLJKQ,139,1387,Just the right Tablet,Nick Maskell,5,Yes,03-Mar-14,-,0,"I was worried it would be too small, but i think it is just the perfect size. Standard sized iPads are just to big, this is confortable enough to watch a movie or browse the web."
B00DVFLJKQ,139,1388,Does not disappoint.,SimpsonSM,5,Yes,15-Feb-14,1,0,"Lives up to all the hype and more. Great display, beautiful styling and color. We are hooked! Very nice device!"

B00DVFLJKQ,140,1392,Still one of the best you can buy,Keith Johnson,4,Yes,20-Jul-15,1,0,"I love this tablet. It's light, has a bright screen, fast response. The larger tablets are too big for me, I'm not an iOS fan, and can't stand Samsung's bloated skin over the Android OS. This offers a simple, dependable, reliable Android experience. I use it for web surfing, Kindle books (leisure and tech books), music, even logging in to work remotely in a pinch. No issues. Good deal for the cost. Minor complaints, are that the screen is sometimes not sensitive to touches, and I have to push down slightly. Not a show stopper though. And, the (in)famous lack of expandable memory is a pain. But overall this is a great tablet that does everything I need."
B00DVFLJKQ,140,1393,Five Stars,Hans Hauska,5,Yes,11-Jul-14,-,0,"New version (vers 2) very good as equipped with dual cameras. Excellent for communication, navigation etc"
B00DVFLJKQ,140,1394,SWeeeet!,2-Stage,5,Yes,05-Dec-13,2,0,Is there a 4.5 stars? This is no Apple but it's pretty darn good for the price. Display is better than the iPad Mini. Android is versatile. But..there is less fluidity than the mini. Most people would never know it. It has (I think) to do with the ballistics in dragging and scrolling. I like the form factor BETTER than the iPad mini. And this is much easier to hold onto because of the rubberish back and size. AND it has wireless charging which if you haven't tried you should. That was a make or break for me. It is absolutely buttonless on the front..a big plus. And the apps are getting better but admittedly the mini has better apps. I got the one without the data plan and haven't missed it. You probably can use your cell phone for a wifi hot point if you really need it. Or get one of Verizon's Jetpak so 10 of you can share a 4G connection via your WIFI. I'd buy again for sure.
B00DVFLJKQ,140,1395,Best tablet in the world today,Nader Kamal,5,Yes,19-Mar-14,-,0,"Google Nexus 7 is the best tablet in the world today. Slim, powerful processor, great touch screen & very nice shape."

B00DVFLJKQ,141,1402,I recommend you run away far and fast,Roy Syzmanski,1,Yes,14-Dec-16,-,0,"It bricked itself in under a year of ownership. I didn't do anything to it. Just one stay it froze and then bricked. Now it won't get past the GOOGLE on screen. I'm going to try to flash it and get it back to factory base settings, but don't know if it'll work. It is insane that this happened in under a year of ownership. If you're considering this table, I recommend you run away far and fast."

I also got her an eye-fi sd card which she is using with her canon and nexus 7 right now on a school trip to Spain.

Having both cameras is great, though I never use the front-facing one. So basically, having an actually-usable-camera is great.

Lighter and slimmer too, which took me awhile to get used to."
B00DVFLJKQ,141,1407,Quite impressive.. so far,RahatS,5,Yes,25-Nov-13,1,0,"Pure unadulterated Android experience..too good. And add kitkat 4.4 to it, to which this tablet just got upgraded to. Ownership experience so far..pretty positive."

B00DVFLJKQ,142,1411,"7"" supreme",Damon Flores,5,Yes,02-Apr-14,-,0,Just the right weight and size to make if comfortable to hold. Great screen resolution creates a nice clear picture for video playback. Fast processor keeps my apps running smooth.
B00DVFLJKQ,142,1412,Better than a comparable Ipad. Google finally got it right!!!,Vivek,5,Yes,13-Sep-13,2,0,"I was very frustrated with my old Samsung Galaxy 7 tab. It was big and clunky. Everything was soooooo slow, It came installed with tons of bloatware that could not be uninstalled. There were always jobs running in the background which caused the battery to drain out in 2-3 hours (even when the tablet was left unused).

I was looking for an alternative but the other android tablets had its own set of deficiencies.
Google finally gets it right with the new Nexus. I would even say that it is better than a comparable ipad.

The earlier models appear to have had some issues with the touch screen (ghost touches) and the GPS software as well.
I did not have any of the issues. It appears that GOOGLE has addressed all the issues in the newer hardware released recently.
I myself waited for Amazon to go out of stock on this and only then placed my order. Yours should be ok.

Pluses:
It is thin and light weight.
The display is just awesome. Spekers are good.
Thanks to the quad core processor the tablet is super fast
The interface is so intuitive and user friendly
Battery life is good
Finally GOOGLE has added a rear camera.
The price is reasonable.

All in all a worthy challenger to the ipad (may be even better in some ways).
I totally love this tablet and never leave home without it.

Get this along with the ""MoKo Google New Nexus 7 FHD 2nd Gen Case"". The reviews of the case are true. This is the best one available out for the Nexus 7

B00DVFLJKQ,142,1420,Mixed feelings...,Eddard S.,3,Yes,20-Aug-13,1,2,"This is a great tablet. Easy to hold. Amazing screen. Fast. Just all around awesome.

After a few weeks of owning it, issues began. Google these because they seem to be happening to a small % of Nexus 7 owners.

Reboots: This thing is rebooting on it's own like crazy right now. Sometimes every 10 minutes.

Wifi: Samething, just randomly shutting off the wifi - sometimes after only 5 minutes of use. Then you have to reset. Impossible to watch a streaming video when this is going on.

GPS: I don't use the GPS much so I can't comment, but lots have noticed this.

Right now I returned it (<30 day window) and will try a new one. I will be watching closely over the next 3 weeks to see if my rebooting and wifi problems persist.

Great tablet but only if it actually works.

Nexus #2: Right out of the gate looks ok with an hour of use BUT now Netflix will not work. Will update after 7 days of use. Unfortunate that Netflix doesn't work after reboots, re-install, etc. Others are reporting this netflix problem also."

Plays movies no matter what crazy format they are in with the right app. I do wish it had more internal memory or an SD slot thought, because 32 gigs fills up pretty fast."
B00DVFLJKQ,143,1428,... half a year and I have gotta say I love this tablet,Fiq,5,Yes,28-Aug-14,-,0,"I have used this tablet for close to half a year and I have gotta say I love this tablet. Its not as bulky as a 10"" tablet but it works all the same. Its blazingly fast and the battery life works for my lifestyle. I only need to charge it once every couple of days, sometimes even once a week depending on my usage. I would say get the Nexus with the bigger capacity as the lack of removable storage can be a pain quite fast. Just a little junk here and there and the memory will be full. However, the Nexus doesn't perform any worse even though the memory is full; Asus has indeed improved on the memory for this device.

Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great small tablet to use on the morning commute. Its small and light and easy to use."

you have to force your nexus 7 to upgrade or you can wait your turn.

go to settings:scroll to apps:swipe to the right until you see ""all"" not ""running"" and not "" downloaded""
then scroll down until you see ""Google services frame work"" select that
then tap on ""force stop"" then tap on ""clear data"" then tap "" clear cache""
Then go back to settings, then scroll down to ""about phone"" then click on "" check now""

if it doesn't find an update do it all over again and it should work then..I had to do it twice"

The tablet market is so crowded right now and now, it's all about the specs for a robust piece of hardware and the backbone it provides. I'm an Android girl, so I've never considered an iPad Mini, but I know the specs comparatively.

The Nexus 7 has a very solid feel to it and the slip-resistent grip on the back is fabulous. I do have a tricky time with the thinner bevel on the vertical/portrait view, but you get used to it. The native Android 4.3 is spiffy, fast and responsive - I haven't encountered any problems with the utilization since I started using it. Most notable is the resolution in true HD -- you REALLY see the difference; text is super sharp and watching HD video is simply amazing to view. So sharp and clear!

I've closed out running apps, put the device in Airplane mode, and disabled backups, but the battery drain while in standby is still completely unacceptable. If it's that bad while in standby, you can imagine how quickly the battery drains when I'm actually using it.

If this issue gets addressed with a software update, I will add more stars to my review, but as things stand, I'm thinking of returning this product :("

Combined with the price point, you just can't beat the value. Unfortunately, Google went away from the 7 and decided to up it to 9 and make a 6"" phone. The jump in price of the 9 forced me to a different tablet. It is really too bad."

B00DVFLJKQ,152,1520,First tablet and impressed,anon,5,Yes,09-May-14,1,0,"Being my first tablet (I do not even use a smartphone) and a lifelong user of desktop computers, I was expecting a limited, clunky, and slow device. I was wrong, the tablet worked right out of the box without issues. WiFi only required the router password before connecting for the first time. The performance is great, it has plenty of storage, the touch screen is very responsive, the interface is very easy to learn, and the image / text quality is superb. Battery life is great, even with WiFi, Bluetooth, and apps running. I already tested the Bluetooth and USB connectivity (using an OTG adapter) with some industrial sensors and it works great. The tablet is highly configurable and extendable through custom apps.

The Google play store has most if not all the apps you will ever want, and if it does not have it, you can write your own with several free developing environments available for android.

I was looking at a comparable Windows 8 tablet but the Nexus is made for a touch interface and has a much more robust and mature environment for a portable device."

Screen quality is good though.
Another issue are speakers - they are too quiet, you can't barely hear with open windows and city street noise.
Battery life is from 1-2 days with high usage (regular watching movies, playing etc) to a week with non-regular usage (listening music, rear browsing etc)"

One purchased directly from Google and two via Amazon fulfilled by Asus. Well, about 50% of the devices have microphone issues so if you never use the microphone, say skype, you may want to try so you can get it repaired if it is broken. Now, if you purchase via Amazon the repair process through Asus requires you to pay shipping and then they take over a month to make the repair providing no information. It's a product with issues so buy it from Google they have better service."

Also, I was amazed with the capability of syncing EVERYTHING from your Android phone (my husband has a Sony Experia Z) and it synced apps, his wall paper and accounts to this tablet all through his google account, that's because he has the primary account.

I, on the other hand had the non-primary account and use it for Instagram (browsing)! :D haha..but I like how it feels and how it works. My husband also created another account for my niece so she could instagram on it too and restrict that account to not be able to download apps.

It has a lot of features - we love it! The only downside is the camera quality and that it doesn't have external storage."

B00DVFLJKQ,161,1603,Worthy upgrade to N7(2012),Tim Chim,5,Yes,27-Aug-13,2,0,"I owned both generations of N7. Comparing the two I think the 2103 one lead in:
- Much much better screen
- Better responsiveness
- Better battery life
- Ligther, slimmer

While for the grip and texture on the back I actually prefer the old one.
But to conclude I think the 2013 is definitely a worthy upgrade!"
B00DVFLJKQ,161,1604,i want one!!!,Bear,5,Yes,21-Dec-13,1,0,"Bought this for a gift for my bro. He loves it. Screen is excellent, very responsive, and the product itself, you could tell it's durable. A little heavy relative to the tab 3, but far superior."

Only problem I've encountered is the rotation bug. Latest 5.1.1 update solved the problem by taking away the rotation option lol. I'm not buying another tablet unless it has two things- 1. Removable battery. 2. SD card. I don't use cloud storage. It's not secure and cost extra $s.

Another great feature is whole bunch of various firmwares and kernel which can boost performance and tune powersaving.
Also I like dimensions and sound quality. Easy to hold with one hand. Stereo effect without any software surprised me along with absence of significant distortion on high levels of volume. Sound chip also performs well."

B00DVFLJKQ,162,1620,Got a Dud... but Amazon replacement service ROCKS!,uh-60m,4,Yes,06-Nov-13,-,2,"I received this item last night and immediately noticed I had a touch problem with my screen. I updated to the latest software, tried it on different surfaces etc but for some reason it was missing touch inputs. The first sign was when I used the swipe keyboard and it kept breaking the trail without lifting my finger.

I am currently leaving it at 4 stars because the exchange has been completely simple! I logged onto amazon and requested a replacement. It should be here tomorrow. This is so much better than my last experience with google play and my 2012 Nexus 7. The only down side is a waisted a screen protector on a bad device. I will update after the replacement unit arrives.

----------UPDATE----- 20 NOV 2013

I received my replacement device and it did not have the touch issues. I did have a fairly severe screen bleed in the upper right corner of the device in portrait mode. In the end I decided to keep the device because after reading comments, it appears the screen bleed is a popular issue and more than likely the replacement device would have the same thing. I am happy with the tablet for the price.... now I am just waiting for the 4.4 update."

Colors are extremely crisp and sharp pictures. Loved that you can actually upload through a USB drive which you can't do with an Apple product. Has a vast selection of free applications that are of value as well as the large amount of applications that are already uploaded.

tablet is fast and I have had no problems at all."
B00DVFLJKQ,164,1637,Best tablet for my purposes,David Hudson,5,Yes,22-Oct-13,2,0,"This tablet best suited my criteria, which are as follows:

-Fast, customizable experience (Android flys on this tablet, I have seen nary a hiccup even after weeks without restarting the device)

-Convenience in mobility. What I am getting at here is the form factor. I have had 10 inch tablets in the past that were fantastic devices, but the form factor was simply too large for me. I would find myself gravitating to the computer as the tablet felt to be of little value in comparison to the full computer experience at the 10 inch dimensions.

-Clear screen for reading. I typically use this device for reading RSS, forums, and short stories. Because text often is much more pleasurable to read when crystal clear, a good resolution on the tablet is a huge factor. This tablet has a 1920x1200 pixel display, which looks especially crisp on a 7"" device.

If these are the sorts of criteria you are after in a tablet device, I have no better recommendation than the N7 2013."

However, the whole reason I bought a tablet was for the long battery life and convenience; after buying it in Feb, battery is draining quickly and it takes forever to recharge (like a day). I have to return it and hopefully get it fixed, but this is a widespread issue with the Nexus according to a quick Google search."

B00DVFLJKQ,165,1644,Amazing tablet for the price.,D. A. Down,5,Yes,12-Sep-13,-,0,"I love the clarity of the display. I can view full web pages now instead of having to scroll right and left all the time when I used my old Galaxy Tab. I was disappointed that it didn't have a SD card slot, so I bought the 32gb model to make sure I'd have lots of space. It would also have been nice to have a 3G version for built-in internet access while traveling, but I can use my old Tab as a hot-spot in a pinch.

There must be some quality control issues, as some users are reporting having lots of problems with their tablet, but mine has been performing great. The only thing that worried me was the long time it took to reboot after the first system upgrade was installed."

B00DVFLJKQ,165,1650,Good with few flaws,maxsis,4,Yes,29-Oct-13,2,0,This product could get 5 stars but it has few annoying bugs. First is that sometimes it doesn't respond when typing or playing games. It looks like it freezes for 1 sec and then it is all good after that. And the wifi is terrible I only get around 300kb/s on WiFi. With my cellphone I get 2 Mb/s. Other than those 2 issues it works like a charm.

It has worked very well for more than 1 year and counting. The battery last long. We use it for a lot of things such as surfing internet, reading books and papers, listening to music, and watch video. We tried to use it for Skype but the video quality is not as good as my laptop so we stopped after the first time."

B00DVFLJKQ,167,1670,"Thinner, faster",Bruce Bevitz,5,Yes,02-Oct-13,2,0,"This was bought to replace the old Nexus 7. Screen better, Innards faster, but just about the same as the old one."

But Nexus is pretty good when I use one hand only.
Also, try to open the same app, or open a browser to search an item, Nexus outruns ipad"
B00DVFLJKQ,168,1672,LOVE IT,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,01-Sep-13,3,0,"I was very concerned about the issues that I read on here but made the jump and bought the 32GB version. I'm so glad I did as I've played with it for several days and have had none of the issues others have experienced...lucky so far. I have an iPad 3 which I like but in traveling I have found it to be a little bulky. So I really wanted to try a 7"" tablet and with the price of the Nexus it was very appealing.

What I like:
* Very slim design
* Build quality feels good, although Applet Mini felt the best but not enough to go the more expense route to try mini
* Display in gorgeous
* Dual speakers, when I was looking at the Mini the volume didn't seem as good but who knows just personal taste
* Really like how Android allows you to switch between apps and multitask
* My biggest one, profiles. Love, love, love the profiles. I have one, my wife and my son. It is so easy to switch between them and everyone gets all their own settings and apps of their choice.
* I really like Google Now for search and the cards with customized info that changes based on location
* Push app install from Google Play, love it
* App Widgets, so cool

What I Don't like:
* There is what I think wasted space on top and bottom. Not sure why this is and at first it was weird. After a couple of days of use it does not bother me but I think it can be done better
* LED notification light blinks very slow like once every 7 -10 secs which makes you stare at it longer to see if you have an email waiting

Price was what really got me exited about trying this tablet out. Being in the $200 side it was very hard not to try it being my first 7"". So far so good and I will update if any issues come up."

I have carried an Samsung cell phone for years with the Android OS. I have owned a iPad for a couple of years and would rate the Nexus 7 against it as fast or faster. The screen on the Nexus is also comparable as far as brightness and clarity. I am still stumbling around with the OS on the Android vers the Apple but am finding I do prefer the Apple OS for the most part. But for the money the Nexus 7 is hard to not like.
B00DVFLJKQ,169,1682,Much better than any Apple Product.,Jimmy S,5,Yes,07-Oct-13,5,0,"Coming from a life long apple user, this is better than anything Apple IOS has ever put out. Its faster than my $500 computer.

EDIT - 4-16-14

Its been quite a few months since I bought this tablet. Its still just as fast and as useful as before!!! I used to use my iTouch for everything! But now with this tablet is much better and quicker. It can also do much more on the web than an apple product."

The product came in its original packaging and still wrapped in the original plastic. Needless to say i am very happy with the results and i only had to pay $170-180. I urge anyone with the funds to buy this to do it. It is very fast and feels like a premium piece of equipment, very solid."

B00DVFLJKQ,169,1686,"Great tablet, no worries.",Buzzer,5,Yes,25-Mar-15,2,0,"This is a top-notch tablet. I was worried about not having an SD card expansion, but between Google Drive, and having 32GB on board, I haven't had anything to worry about in terms of storage. There's really nothing I can say beyond the fact that it's a great Android flagship device at a wonderful price.

Pros:
Speed.
Great quality/feel.
Decent speakers so I don't really need a set of BT speakers if I have a few friends over.
Updates to the latest Android... currently on Lollipop and enjoying it.

Cons:

B00DVFLJKQ,170,1694,No SD card slot.,David N. Groshans,3,Yes,15-Jan-15,1,0,"Good device, works great. This looses two stars for some two main reasons. First, the obvious, it is loaded with Google spyware, otherwise know as data collection from your personal information on the device. You can turn off some of the collection, but not not all. I will say this with Google store, it advices what information is collected by the apps you wish to install. Quite a few apps I refuse to install because they asked for information that had noting to do with the app (other then advertising). I can understand the ads as a way to make money, but why would a game need to know my contact's information?

The second issue is the lack of a SD card reader. The whole point of a tablet is to be portable. Now I have to carry other ""parts"" to read the SD card from my SLR camera. Also, to save internal memory, any files I create or want to use on the Nexus needs to be stored in Google cloud to be useable (requiring WiFi access). Not easy to save the files (books, movies or music) on an external memory. This lack of a SD card reader slot is worth the removal of 2 stars by itself."
B00DVFLJKQ,170,1695,It is great,Sandy,5,Yes,13-Oct-13,-,0,"I like this tablet for several reasons. First, it is light and the size is perfect for me to grab, not too large to handle still good to read. Second, the design looks stylish when I cover it with a colorful case to protect it. Third, it works great so far.
Of course, if you would like to read scientific paper with a tablet, larger screen is recommended."

I was concerned that there was a design flaw as many folks posted comments about charging and rebooting problems. However, I have not suffered any problems. So very light compared to my 10 inch Lenovo K1 tablet.My only problem is that Flash is missing. So many websites depend upon Flash that I can see it will be a problem accessing the Amazon Video Library and other services."

I have had no issues, unlocked and rooted easily for those you like to do that. The 7 inch size is perfect for me, easy to carry around and large enough to watch movies on. If it had an sd slot I'd given 5 stars"

Has not frozen up once and has a flawless display :-) The only problem at all is no microSD slot... But with 32gb and a rooted system with OTG support, it more than makes up for it!!

BUT GOOD LORD, THE PLUG IS SO HARD TO GET IN!! It's a tiny, micro-USB plug in and if you're not looking right at it, you're fishing around for it. Seriously. Looking right at it. It's dark, the tablet is dark, most of the aftermarket cases are dark. You end up fishing around like you're reading braille.

Yeah, I love I didn't have to get a new charger for it, but I gladly would have to have made it easier to plug in.

A relatively minor gripe, but it bugs the heck out of me. Other than that, I love it."

Their position was that any charge port failure was a customer induced failure. They offered to fix the device for nearly the cost of a new device.

If you buy this tablet, do yourself a favor and pick up a wireless charger for when the charge port inevitably fails."
B00DVFLJKQ,172,1712,Exactly what I needed,David,5,Yes,19-Oct-13,-,0,I have had my Nexus for about two weeks now and I love it. It does everything I need it to do. I have found all the apps I needed and they work smoothly. It runs Skype from Afghanistan beautifully. I couldn't be happier.
B00DVFLJKQ,172,1713,Quality product.,C.M.B.,5,Yes,14-Jun-17,1,0,Been using this tablet for a few years now. Just posting a review. Love it. Use it as my Kindle and study aid.
B00DVFLJKQ,172,1714,The Right Choice,Mitchell Lobetos,5,Yes,25-Oct-14,-,0,It really does everything you want/need it to plus it's affordable. The nexus 7 did it right and I definitely made the right choice over other comparable tablets.
B00DVFLJKQ,172,1715,Keep it charged up above 10%,Luv Amazon,4,Yes,01-Sep-13,2,0,"Nice toy, but note to all. Keep it on charger every few days or so. I left mine in sleep mode for about 5 days & battery dropped down to 10% at which point it lost its mind. After that it would not boot up but stuck forever at the nexus 'X' during boot up. Nexus Online Help was useless. Eventually found android community where this common problem was discussed & a guy was kind enough to explain how to fix this bug. It involved a complete reset to factory settings and all my custom settings & apps were lost."
B00DVFLJKQ,172,1716,Great buy,jfs10,5,Yes,04-Aug-13,2,0,"I purchased this device to replace an Acer A100. What a difference. I like the A100 and for its time, it was not a bad tablet, The Nexus 7 tablet is great. For the price, I think people would struggle to find a new or used tablet that could go head to head with it. It is well made. It does not have a cheap look or feel. The screen is outstanding. The device is very fast. My only complaint is no flash player. Amazon is my main video source, and I can't watch them on this tablet. Wish Amazon would come out with an Amazon Instant video app for Android. Wish Google would allow flash a bit longer."

* It's fast, with no jerkiness like my ASUS Transformer Prime TF201-B1-GR Eee Pad 10.1-Inch 32GB Tablet (Amethyst Gray)
* With the high resolution, the screen is incredibly clear

Downsides:
* No uSD card. So I can't put the majority of my music and audiobook collection on there (yes, I can do that with Google play)
* No keyboard. A folding Bluetooth keyboard will suffice.
* Not many accessories for this model. I assume this will be popular, and the accessories will come, in time."

B00DVFLJKQ,173,1730,"Solid, Fast, Pretty. Still a second class Amazon Citizen",zerolagtime,4,Yes,03-Aug-13,3,0,"I've been setting this up for my Mom for her birthday. I convinced the underwriter (Dad) that this would work well because, well of course, Amazon On Demand VIdeo works. Right? It's on the iPad and iPhone. Netflix is everywhere. Surely Amazon sees the demand for Android tablets? You would be wrong. Getting video on demand to work requires that you install Firefox and an older Flash plugin (sideloaded). Not something that a techno-afraid person will do. This is easy under iOS.
Everything else on the device is everything I expected to see. My wife has an iPad mini and I think that both users will enjoy their experience. Lots of apps, lots of room. And of course, the blissful belief that everyone understands where to find everything. Apple has the same problem. Users fresh to the platform are going to have to spend a few minutes learning about home screens, back arrows, task managers, and notifications. I haven't touched Android since 2.3 or so and I had a few things to learn.
I really like the device, but I'm going to mention to everyone I tell this story, that Amazon is completely neglecting the on-demand video segment. I've seen dozens of complaints online that people ask and ask Amazon for video. For over two years, IIRC. The Kindle Fire is should be this Nexus. Pay Asus to pre-install the Amazon apps right next to Google. Make it so that it only works on Android 4.3 just to drive sales.
I got this device ordered within hours of it becoming available. Within 24 hours, the backorder line was 3 to 4 *weeks*. Google has been pumping this, so you know demand has been high. Everyone is trading in their older Nexus 7. Time waits for no man.

As is, now I'm going to recommend another video service to my Mom since Amazon clearly doesn't want the market share. This probably will be one more nail in the coffin for everyone complaining about Amazon Prime add-ons and collecting state tax. I don't recommend this if you are looking to embrace the Amazon Marketplace. If, however, you could care less about Amazon, then I think that the features, price, feel, and stability are fantastic. Take it.

Linux users: I don't know about other Android devices, but the Nexus 7 only presents itself as an MTP device. While this allows rapid unplug and go, my Ubuntu 12.04 distro hasn't been very stable with the device and I've had to use Windows 7 where it works just like you would expect. I also had to play some command-line ninja to mount it as a filesystem to copy files in."
B00DVFLJKQ,174,1731,Three Stars,Tennis,3,Yes,15-Jun-15,2,0,good price but defective item !
B00DVFLJKQ,174,1732,Beats apple in my book,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,05-Apr-14,3,0,This is so much better than my iPad 1. It also blows away the Apple products with the diversity of apps.
B00DVFLJKQ,174,1733,Plagued with quality control problems,Amazon Customer,3,Yes,20-Aug-13,26,0,"Unfortunately, I'll be sending in my third attempt at receiving a unit without defects. My first N7 had either poor color calibration or something wrong with the graphics unit as there was a pink tint that was present everywhere on the screen. It was especially noticeable when I tried to scroll text.

I was able to replace it (thank you amazon for your amazing policy), but my second N7 came with over 9 different stuck pixels. By now I'm slightly frustrated, but lets aim for best out of three amirigh?

My third unit actually came in today and the first thing I saw was a dead pixel. I'm sorry, but Asus, you really need to get your act together. I hope amazon sends all these returned units back to you to say what an awful job you've done making sure good units are sent out to your customers. I feel awful for amazon as they are a great company that has to deal with this device.

If it weren't for the high percentage of defects, this would be one of the best tablets I could recommend to anyone, but as it is, I'll be avoiding asus products like the plague.

C'mon asus! get your act together."
B00DVFLJKQ,174,1734,Gets better everyday,Daniel Collins,5,Yes,14-Apr-14,1,0,"First tablet. I have slowly been learning how to use. I have since purchased a Nexus 5 and HP Chromebook 14. To think, I started with a manual typewriter. Now I Just need a google digital camera."
B00DVFLJKQ,174,1735,1 year warranty is not enough,Liana R.,1,Yes,14-May-16,1,0,My nexus randomly failed 2 years after buying it. It had no mechanical damage and I had not installed any recent updates. It is stuck on the google icon and can't be restored by recovery or bootloader modes. I have called Asus and they can't do anything for me without a serial number. They estimated a repair at $156. I'm very disappointed.

B00DVFLJKQ,174,1738,Great device,"Nguyen in The Colony, TX",5,Yes,20-Sep-13,-,0,"I need a new GPS to replace the old broken Garmin and I got more than what I bargain for... a book reader, video player, mp3 player, Internet browser, and much more. I love it! The only thing that I don't like is the battery."
B00DVFLJKQ,174,1739,Like this but 1gen would have been fine.,BJ Seh,4,Yes,01-Aug-13,2,0,"OK have had this for a week now. First, like that it is fast. Like that I can hold it in my small hand easier. It is thinner and as a female I like I can hold it one handed.

Like that the screen is better, noticeably better. I can view from the side of the screen, do that with your tablet, any tablet that is not a i-pad. That is the upgrade.

Like that the speakers are noticeably louder. The 1 gen N7, I absolutely had to use headphones. I can choose to use them with this version.

I have not had an issue with it losing the router connection like others in fact it is faster than my 1 gen, significantly so. Downloads have been super fast.

Now the bad.

This thing slides out of my hand like my S4 did. It is not grippy like the 1gen was. I liked that made me feel I had a hold of my tab.

This thing takes forever to get a full charge. My 1gen takes 1 hour or so with a high speed. This one takes a couple of hours at least. However, the battery lasts a bit longer. On lowest brightness, 2 days longer for me.

The screens freeze. Not sure if this is a 4.3 issue, but I have had it freeze in apps like Amazon, EBay and Twitter. The keyboard or buttons inside the app will not function. A simple off then back on, not a complete shut down, fixed the issues. Except for twitter, I had to shut down twice to correct. It has not done it since 2 days ago. So maybe it has been corrected.

I am worried that this one it just feels not as durable as my 1 gen. Don't laugh but...I read a lot of books, and I fall asleep reading. So I did not worry that I would fall asleep with my 1 gen. It was like a tonka toy. Built tough. If I elbowed it it would be OK. Or it fell, or I slept on it. This one I am not so sure I will be taking it to bed with me. I may keep my 1 gen and continue to sleep with it.

Update...8/3 Something is weird with the keyboard and screen. The screen is not as responsive as my 1st gen. I sometimes have to hit some app buttons 4 times before they respond.

The keyboard will type the same letter twice on one tap. This is super annoying. Also it is so sensitive that I have to correct words because it believes it knows what I am typing before I do. Working on the settings. Gosh super annoying even typing this review."

B00DVFLJKQ,175,1744,Buyer Beware! Waste of money!,Patches,1,Yes,26-Oct-14,1,2,"I purchased one of these and found debris/dust under the screen, it was very annoying. I tried to take a pic with the rear facing camera only to find a huge chunk of dust on all pics, I figured something was on the lens, I cleaned the lens with a cotton swab and that didn't make a difference. I have exchanged this device 3 times, the third one had no dust/ debris under screen. However it didn't function properly. I sent it back for full refund.Asus should have pulled these tablets for screen and major malfunction issues!; I would highly reccomend purchasing a Amazon kindle or Samsung galaxy, I have both tablets and they both work great, 5 stars on both! Buyer beware, don't waste your money"
B00DVFLJKQ,175,1745,Amazing tablet (32gb),CJ Owen,5,Yes,21-Sep-13,1,0,"Last year when the first nexus 7 was announced I had already bought the Samsung galaxy tab 2 7.0. Looking back I wish I had waited for it because the tab was good but didn't get my updates and it slowed down. When I heard the new nexus 7 was announced I took a look at the specs and immediately wanted to buy it. Just to make sure people enjoyed it too I read many reviews on amazon (one of the best parts of amazon) and found many positive reiews. There were also many negative reviews as well. These reviews seemed to be about the software and the GPS issue. 1. If you don't like pure android don't buy this tablet unless you plan to root it and install a new ROM (remember this is PURE android). 2. I haven't experienced any GPS issues. Overall though this is a great tablet. Here are my pro And con's

Pros
- amazing screen on the tab 2 7.0 you could count the pixels. Here you dont even know they are there.
- fast. the tablet is overall fast escpecially on high graphic games
- average battery life. With a better screen it's good it has a decent battery life

Cons
- a couple of frozen screens but in android this is something that happens even on the best tablets
- there was an error with connecting to the internet but after a hard reboot it was all fixed and hasn't appeared again

Overall a great tablet for a good price. Definitely the best tablet on the market"
B00DVFLJKQ,175,1746,"GPS useless, screen sensitivity not good.",Evets Nivel,3,Yes,04-Sep-13,4,1,GPS only works in house where it can connect to Wi-Fi. Outside it is totally useless.

B00DVFLJKQ,175,1748,Seems to be a snappy little tablet...,S. Sale,5,-,26-Jul-13,"1,768",51,"*** This review is for a 32GB, WiFi only tablet.

I just picked one of these little guys at my local BB presale because I'm impatient and had to try one. Yes, I actually have one and I'm not BS'ing.

Being an IT professional, I've used a variety of Android and Apple devices, probably dozens at this point. I'm well versed in Apple, Android and Microsoft world, and have a MCSE/MCSA and half a dozen other MS/IT certs, so I know what I'm talking about.

I suspect it will take a month or two before I'm fully versed in the eccentricities of this tablet, but here is my 3 hours of use review:

First Impressions:

Upon receiving the box, I was pleasantly surprised by how small and minimal it is. Very similar to Apple packaging, which is best in the business in my opinion. Upon turning it on and signing into my Google account, I was immediately greeted by several updates. 0-day updates to be expected from a major release and are appreciated.

As usual, my Google account wanted to sync all my previous Play Store apps onto the device which I immediately stopped. No stupid Verizon apps for you! One of my primary reason for getting this tablet was for gaming. I'm disappointed by the horridly slow memory on my old Kindle Fire, and I hate the uphill battle that comes with trying to Jailbreak and install emulators on Apple tablets. I nearly bought a Nexus 7 Gen1 until I heard it had slow storage as well. Once I heard that Nexus 7 Gen2 had greatly improved storage speeds, as well as better specs down the board, I was sold. I won't bore you with all the specs, as you can read those in the Amazon description above. However, I must point out one particularly great spec that this tablet has, and many covet: a 1080p screen on a 7"" tablet. There are no current 7"" tablets on the market that match that PPI, but I'm sure Apple's iPad mini 2 will match or come close to it. (when it comes out)

Performance:

I have no gear to officially test the dynamic contrast and black levels of the screen, but CNET (Normally Apple biased) gave a very impressive 570/0.44 cd/m2 for it's max brightness/black level, putting it at 1,295:1 contrast ratio, beating the socks off the iPad Mini's 814:1, and the old Nexus 7 at 1,028:1. I notice this most in black and white movies like Casablanca, (my usual test) but color also pops much better too. The color levels are more accurate across the board than the greenish tint of the first N7, and give Apple a run for the money.

If gaming is your target, it's interesting to find that the Nexus 7 Gen2 meets or exceeds the iPad Gen4. GFXBench tests put the N7g2 consistently in line with the iPad, no small feat for a sub-$300 device. I confirmed this performance by playing a number of games and finding that I couldn't slow this little guy down; Galaxy on Fire's new android release, Project Y, and a host of old standbys. It runs an Adreno 320, the same as the mighty HTC One, so if an HTC One plays it well, the Nexus 7 will too. It also typically beats a Nexus 10 in all tests, so if your choice between these two tablets is speed, the N7 is the obvious winner.

When I got the tablet it was at 50% battery life. It took about 2 hours before it was at 100%. I'm guessing it will take 3-4 hours with the shipped charger to bring it from 0 to 100.

Other improvements:

The improvements in Android 4.3 are not going to be apparent for a while, as the main improvements are OpenGL ES 3.0 and app security permissions. However, it also includes battery improvements which seem to stretch an additional hour of video watching despite it's slightly smaller battery. It's also a little thinner than the 1st gen Nexus 7, by around 1.8mm. Usually thin tablets annoy me and are awkward to hold, but the Nexus 7 has comfortable rounded sides and a soft rubber back. The front is a fingerprint magnet of course.

Value and software:

Last but not least, the Nexus 7 is only $230 for a 16GB model, or $270 for 32GB. Compare this to an iPad mini at $330 for a 16GB model, or a 32GB at $430. The original Nexus 7 seems to be going for under $200 now, so if all you need is a nice internet browser and like to dabble in everything else, the Nexus 7 Gen 1 is actually a great deal.

A last positive comes in the form of the Apple/Android philosophy. This baby comes ready to be loaded up with any ROM you chose, as do all of the Nexus series. There aren't any real releases yet, but I expect there to be some great ones over the next few months. Apple does it's best to prevent Jailbreaking. If you don't know the benefits of either, and consider yourself a tinkerer, then you may want to brush up on them.

The other part of this Android/Apple philosophical difference takes the place of Apple censorship. I HATE IT. Apple tries it's best to keep it's store locked down with American prude censorship. Google doesn't. Apple also nixes nearly any emulator apps they can. This means no DOSBox, SNES, NES, Genesis and Playstation emulators for you if you're stuck on an Apple device. That sucks a big one. One of the big reasons I will not pick up an IOS device.

Now for negatives:

1.) The obvious being that the Google Play Store gets some games later than the Apple App Store. Nearly all the ""good"" games are available on both within months, but the tendency is for Apple to get the initial release followed closely. by Play Store. However, the total number of Apps in either store is now shifted into Google's favor, as it now has over 1,000,00 apps compared to Apple's 900,000+, with the lead growing each month. So let the stupid, ""My tablet has more apps"" argument die, as it doesn't matter anymore.

2.) The widescreen format and shape can be awkward for some, but I got used to it quickly.

3.) There is no SD card slot. We already expected this as the previous didn't have one, but I really wish it had one so I could load it up with music and movies. Heck, I've got a 64GB microSD card in my phone. Why can't a much larger tablet have one too?

Other than that, I am struggling to find a negative with this tablet. Once again, I think I'll give it a few weeks before I can fully flesh out this review. Until then, I'm gonna enjoy messing with this little guy.

Edit: 48 hours later...

Now that I've had the tablet for a couple days and kicked it around a bit more, I'm still holding firm on my previous statements. I've loaded up Jet Set Radio, Dolphin, Labtech Control Center and a number of other apps to see how well it handles a variety of content. I must say, I'm not having any issues. I loaded up 3DMark so I could see for myself how well it handles a heavy load on it's GPU, and it breezed through even on Extreme, achieving a score of around 6300. The first Nexus is only able to pull off around 1900, making the new model over 3 times faster.

The battery life has been good, as it seems to still have 25-50% charge after a day of moderate to heavy use.

One detail I didn't realize before, but now find apparent is that while the speakers sound good for built in tiny tablet speakers, the volume levels are capped to achieve this. Before the speakers begin to distort bass, the top volume levels out. I kind of wish it could go little further so I could use it for a portable radio while I'm cleaning, but I suppose headphones will fix that. It fits in a pants pocket like a big mp3 player, something I can't pull off with an iPad mini. The iPad mini is 5.3 inches wide, while the Nexus 7 is about 4.7 inches. The widescreen just barely makes it into a back or side pocket without being too tight.

Edit: 7/29

Another detail I've heard from at least one reviewer is that of dead pixels. I HIGHLY recommend running the free app, ""Dead Pixel Test"" as soon as you can. I discovered only two dead pixels on my tablet, both in the top. One is incredibly hard to see except at an angle, and only then in complete black. The other is slightly more visible, but only at an angle again. Dead pixels are to be expected on an high density display, so be extra diligent to identify whether or not your display has a serious problem with dead or stuck pixels. Mine are minor, but a few significant reports have surfaced.

Edit: 8/6/13

After around 2 weeks of use, I'm very happy with the tablet. It has done well with battery life throughout a day or two of moderate use and occasional gaming. I'm waiting on an ultra-slim case from Moko, but would like to see that ""Premium Official Case"" come out so I can decide if it's worth it. Word on the street is the official travel case is not worth the $20 they are asking.

Edit: 9/18/13

I've now had the tablet for almost 2 months and I'm 100% sold on it. It's fast, reliable and just about the perfect size for taking anywhere. I take it to customer sites to use WiFi-Analyzer, take notes, check email, Remote Desktop into PCs/Servers, change configs on network equipment and many other things. My Kindle Fire is now converted into a semi-dedicated iTunes remote because I'm so spoiled by the responsiveness of my Nexus 7.

Also, I rooted it about a week or so ago and put a lean version of 4.3 on it. It's even faster now! I also love the Moko ultra-slim case I put on it. It doesn't add bulk, the magnetic clamps seem to be holding up, and it looks nice.

I'm a very satisfied fan of this tablet.

--------------------------------------------------

""Probable"" final update, 11/12/15

If anyone is still checking this tablet out, here's a final addition to the review. I've had the table for over two years now, and I'm still happy with it and frequently use it for web browsing as well as light gaming, such as Clash of Clans. Its battery still maintains a nice long charge even after continual use for 2 years, and it still does a good job of handling day to day tasks.

Marshmallow, Android 6.0, was pushed out to the tablet over the past month, and seems to be very stable on it.

I guess my review stands. I still really like this tablet. It's still a good value and solid platform."

Beats the Ipad in screen clarity and for all you Apple fans that will fight back saying that the iPad or iPad mini is thinner... I will just ask you one simple question. How many of you will end up using this or any other tablet without a cover and risk dropping it ???

Next Android OS is flash compatible unlike iOS.

This is way cheaper than any of the iPads

I have seen the Samsung Note 8.0 ... and I will forget the price comparision... the Nexus 7 2nd Gen still beats it."
B00DVFLJKQ,176,1755,Best investment,David Rosario,5,Yes,29-Oct-14,-,0,"My favorite device, for everything, the only question you should be asking is what cover you will like."
B00DVFLJKQ,176,1756,"Great product, poorly documented",Amazon Customer,4,Yes,22-Sep-13,2,8,"This is my first tablet, so I don't have a point of comparison. It feels solid, and looks good. Picture is great - bright and super sharp. Viewing is very satisfactory from wider angles. Built in sound is so-so, but what can you expect from tiny speakers? Sound with quality headphones is quite good with MP3s. Typing on the on-screen keypad is rather responsive compared with my Android phone. Other screen touch actions work well.

Documentation is very poor. There is not even a get started sheet in the box. You must have a computer to download the Guidebook, but they don't seem to even tell you that. If you bought this instead of a computer, you may be out-of-luck. Once I downloaded and printed the Guidebook, I tried to set up the Nexus. The written instructions don't work, and I couldn't establish a network connection by following them. I finally got connected by trial and error. Since then, it has been quite stable in connecting via Wi-Fi. The Guidebook gives good information on navigation, but none on the use of the cameras, GPS, music player, or the gallery. Figuring out how to configure settings is often unclear.

I also have a couple of hardware complaints. When the rechargeable battery becomes unusable (and it will), it is not user replaceable. Control buttons like volume and power are small and recessed into the Nexus body, so using them by feel very difficult.

Though not a fault of the Nexus, it won't run Instant Video from Amazon. Amazon doesn't make an Android player app. It does play Amazon Kindle books very well. And there is a player available on the Google Play Store for Netflix. I will be dropping Amazon Prime when the 30 day trial is up.

Overall, I'm thrilled with the Nexus. I would give the fifth star if documentation were complete and accurate."

But then one day, as I was using the device it rebooted itself. I have had this happen with Android and iOS devices, so no big deal. But when it came back on, it froze on the lock screen. Then it rebooted itself again, and again, and I realized it was stuck in a boot loop (always restarting without ever fully turning on). I shut it off, but then it did not come back on at all. I looked up online, and saw that you could try charging it for an hour, and when that did not work, charge it over night. None of that worked. I tried not charging it for a few days to let the battery die and see if it would come back up, but still nothing. Plugging it into the computer would not show a device attached. So I had a nice brick instead of a $269 tablet!

I figured I was within thirty days to try an exchange, but it was a third party seller (not Amazon directly). After trying Google's tips I listed above, I submitted a return request and did not receive a response till the end of November - almost a month after it died - that I was past the return deadline and out of luck.

B00DVFLJKQ,181,1801,Great tablet,Colin Landrum,5,Yes,16-Sep-13,1,0,"This Nexus 7 works great for me and I am satisfied with the technical compromises that made the low price possible. It might be said, for example, that there are faster tablets. I have no problems whatsoever with the speed. I would have little reason to pay more for a faster processor. The screen is beautiful. The speakers are good enough -- what could you expect from such tiny things?

I would have appreciated a sd slot. But, given the way I use the device, I never need unlimited storage. I am never away from my dropbox, google drive, and other computers for very long at a time, so the storage is adequate. Same goes for the battery. I am happy with the battery life, but I am never actually away from sources of power for extended periods.

I mostly needed a device to read pdfs with. Although an e-ink device is great for reading epub or mobi files, they don't do very well with pdfs."
B00DVFLJKQ,181,1802,Love Love Love!,Lia Daniels,5,Yes,14-Apr-14,1,0,This is the perfect size and what a great picture!!! So clear and bluetooth keeboard is perfect for going anywhere.
B00DVFLJKQ,181,1803,still need some feature of Samsung,Mountaineer,4,Yes,10-Jan-14,-,2,"It is really amazing device with nice solid hold , great material. But regarding it software , it needs some feature that Samsung's tabs and phones already have since a while which is : smart stay, multi screen, multi functionality, external SD card and Samsung air...

All these and maybe more Samsung get well done devices with them,
We expect nexus will be the full option android device.

B00DVFLJKQ,181,1806,BANG FOR YOUR BUCK!,Aaron Ray,5,Yes,27-Oct-13,2,0,"I purchased the 32gb model, which I personally recommend if you will be using this for entertainment purposes. The screen is awesome for watching movies playing games. If you plan to get a tablet to use for work this tablet will do good since you can't really find a cheaper, high quality tablet than this. But, if you want too watch movies, play graphic-intensive games with no lag, this tablet is for you."

I am a devoted fan!"

B00DVFLJKQ,182,1815,Micro SD Chip PLEASE,Mark A. Laughlin,4,Yes,30-Jul-13,1,0,"I really like love the size, weight and display quality on this 2nd generation Nexus 7. But it desperately needs a micro-SD slot. I have the 32gb model and I'm already short on space trying to migrate from my old Toshiba Thrive. Every decent smartphone has a micro SD slot, no reason to neglect it on this device...or at least offer 64 gb.

Beyond that one fault, it is simply an amazing device. VERY smooth and responsive. Is a delight when paired with the new ChromeCast. Definitely the best of the 7"" tablets. I have no idea how the iPad mini survives...it seems so crudely, Fischer-Price like compared to the slick Android 4.3 Jelly Bean, live widget capable, interface."
B00DVFLJKQ,182,1816,Five Stars,S. Kruszka,5,Yes,28-Jan-15,-,0,"Was a great price and worked wonderfully, Thank You !"

B00DVFLJKQ,182,1819,Worth it,Nameviolator,5,Yes,29-Oct-13,1,1,"Pros: responsive, 2GB ram, great size

Cons: charging can be a pain sometimes. You will have to do a search for suggestions on how to fix it. Typing on the keyboard takes getting used to. You WILL close whatever you were working on when you go for the space bar.

Other thoughts: Sure you can't upgrade the internal storage, but you can buy a dongle to add an external drive (cheap on Amazon). I will be ordering one soon.

Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend it"
B00DVFLJKQ,182,1820,Very good Tablet right now. but I don't like these camera.,Tanasit B.,4,Yes,20-Dec-13,-,0,"It's very good performance tablet. Price is reasonable
But I don't like photo or video from it.

pros.
- firmware up to date than other android device
- Very sharp display
- high performance

cons.
- photo or video is not good"
B00DVFLJKQ,183,1821,"Very nice tablet, but you will NEED WiFi",Lauren Carey,5,Yes,04-Oct-13,-,0,"I ordered this tablet after reading all the reviews and it is just as nice as everyone says. The screen is very responsive to touch, even mine. Usually touch screens won't recognize when I try to use them, but this one registers every touch. The tablet fits nicely in my hand, making it easy to use. When you plug it in to charge, the battery light shows a white mark to indicate that it is charging.

One of the features I absolutely love is that when you power down with the power button, the screen displays a touch option ""power off"" and then asks for you to confirm that you want to power down. I love this because you can't accidentally shut down and lose data.

Just a warning: you need to have WiFi access in order to set up your tablet the first time. This means that if you don't know your password, you will have to find it before setting up (like I had to).

Overall, this tablet is currently above and beyond my expectations. If that should change over time, I will update to reflect that."
B00DVFLJKQ,183,1822,Great tab,Michael Fassnacht,5,Yes,22-Mar-14,-,0,"This did not disappoint me in any way. I would definitely go for the 32 gig model. Charges fast, battery lasts all day, screen is bright and clear and it very stable. The only thing that could be improved is the camera. Personally a 7 inch tablet is not a good size for a camera any ways so no big deal to me."
B00DVFLJKQ,183,1823,Nice tablet,Charles,4,Yes,30-Oct-13,2,0,"This is a nice tablet for the money.
With the better screen I can read and use it as well as my Asus TF300T which is ten inches.
Wifi and GPS are both better on this tablet. I wish it had an sd slot but otherwise I am pleased.
Note:
I had to flash experimentalX kernel (XDA) and use stick mount (google play store) to use OTG where the TF300T works out of the box."
B00DVFLJKQ,183,1824,Great for a small table,PorcoRosso,5,Yes,22-May-15,-,0,"Perfect except that I wish it was bigger. All the bigger ones don't seem as good, though either reliability-wise (Nexus) or software-bloat-wise (Samsung)."
B00DVFLJKQ,183,1825,Worked great until trying to install update,Nicole,1,Yes,25-May-14,2,1,This tablet worked great until I tried to install the update. It got stuck in the boot loop and there was nothing that I could do to get it out. I returned it and Amazon did a great job in quickly refunding my money back.
B00DVFLJKQ,183,1826,Excellant possession Google Nexus 7 2013. I love it and my daughters and wife also love it.,Suresh DATT,5,Yes,16-Nov-13,3,0,"Even before the launch, I had eye on this. As soon as I got a chance to get it, I placed the Order. Rather this is my second order (a gift for my sister). As I wanted her to enjoy the tab as much I enjoy."

Also, I like the back of it, providing just the right amount of grip. It feels nice and not cheap!"
B00DVFLJKQ,183,1830,Amazing product,Joe B.,5,Yes,21-Oct-13,-,1,"This is my first tablet (test drove the ipad mini). The screen is very nice, watched some tv and the video was smooth. LOTS of free apps out there to do what you need. I changed my key board layout as I use SharePoint and with Chrome installed, it worked great.

The only think I wish they had put on this unit is a micro SD card slot. The OTG process works, but is a bit tech intensive."

B00DVFLJKQ,184,1836,Used tablet received,BOONWOOI TAY,1,Yes,10-Apr-14,-,1,"I can't believe Amazon sent out a unit that looks used. The shipped package was sent to my wife since I am ordering it from oversea and asking my wife, who's on business in the USA, to bring it back for me. Upon opening up the shipped package, my wife discover the Nexus 7 package wasn't sealed. Worse, when she checked what's in the box, she could see scratches on the display and the power button. There is no thing layer of screen protector on the display, like any new tablet or phone would normally come with, even though I have no idea if this is normal a new Nexus 7 tablet. There is power adaptor in the box however no usb cable that connects the adaptor to tablet, again I am not sure if it is supposed to be provided.
Bottom line, when I order this unit from Amazon there is no where in the description saying this is a refurbished or used unit and with the price of $249, I am expecting a new tablet. I have then asked my wife to return it and don't even bother to ask for a replacement. At the time of writing, Amazon has sent me a note on the refund. For this, I give this order a 1-star rating."
B00DVFLJKQ,184,1837,Love it.,G. Friday,5,Yes,12-Sep-13,1,0,"This is my first tablet purchase and who knew I would love it so much. It's a beautiful piece of electronics and is the perfect size. At first I thought it was too small, but I love how it fits perfectly in my purse and is so easy to use. For those interested, the app DSLR Controller works perfectly with the Nexus 7 to control my camera."
B00DVFLJKQ,184,1838,DOA/Dead On Arrival,J. Choy,1,Yes,13-Aug-13,16,4,"I ordered the NEW Nexus 7 FHD 2nd Generation, 32GB, from Amazon on Aug. 1st, and just got it Aug. 12th. It was DOA out of the box!! I tried 3 times to charge the battery: 1) I used the AC Adapter & Power Plug that came with the tablet. The battery icon came on for only a second then disappeared into blackness. I detached & reattached both sides of the power plug to make sure the connections were secure. Again the battery icon shows up then disappears. 2) I used the AC Adapter that came with my iPod & the Nexus Power Plug--same thing happened. Battery icon came on then quickly disappeared. I know the iPod AC Adapter works because I had just used it to charge my iPod. 3) I used the AC adapter & power plug for my Android phone to see if that might work...nothing! So frustrating!!

I gave up and will be returning the tablet tomorrow. I am not requesting a replacement but asking for a full refund after checking out more and more reviews about this tablet. It looks to me like this NEW Nexus 7 is unpredictable: you either get a great tablet that works as they say it should OR you get a real lemon with problems that are not 'fixable.'

I'm really disappointed because I thought I had finally found the right tablet that would work for me after researching and waiting for more than a year. I'm going to take the advice of several reviewers/bloggers and wait to see how the reported issues are resolved before even considering buying it again...maybe."

No regret at all. I actually enjoy all the differences between android and apple. Nexus screen is so gorgeous! I've been watching Netflix and Hulu, read news etc. Pictures are so clear. Also easy to read. Great stereo sounds. It is very light that I can hold it easily in one hand.

B00DVFLJKQ,185,1843,great quality,Gabe,5,Yes,02-Sep-13,1,0,"I bought this tablet as a replacement for the original nexus 7 and I must say I'm impressed. Speakers are awesome, build quality( dropped it a week after getting it onto concrete and besides scuffs on the corners nothing major) but my favorite improvement is the screen. The nexus 4 suffers from washed out colors... So I think Google learned from this and vastly improve colors on this N7 FHD. Resolution is amazing. Resolution+great colors+ great sound make it awesome to watch movies on Netflix or YouTube. I prefer it over my friends iPad mini. It just feels more premium in my opinion.
A worthy upgrade from the original. Highly recommended."

I regret not getting Mini ipad instead but i'm still learning it and giving it its chance. Ipad is definitely easier to figure out. seems you really need to learn how to use it to get the most out of it.. unfortunately there was not Book of Instructions! hello?!
Bought the little plug (OTG/USB) to insert the USB key - didnt work. this was mainly the reason I chose this instead of ipad. so... overall. think I would have been happier w/ Ipad mini.
the screen is smaller than Miniipad too.. didnt think it would ahve made that much of a difference but ultimately, it does.
but well.. for same price I got 32GB instead of 16GB w/ miniIpad.
video image very good. uploaded movies & music easily (more easily than Apple) once I downloaded correct apps.

So I picked up the Nexus 7 and pushed a button...and it came to life and guided me through the simple set-up process, which included asking for my name and e-mail address. That was three days ago. I have downloaded many apps and enabled googleNow - an impressive tool that has the potential to revolutionize the way I interact with my Nexus 7, and with my life routines. I would suggest turning it on quickly to take advantage of the voice recognition and predictive search capabilities."

B00DVFLJKQ,193,1921,Nexus 7 Screen--Too Fragile!,Michael Byers,4,Yes,03-Nov-13,-,0,"These things are too fragile! I had about a week of bliss with my Nexus 7, and then, out of nowhere, the screen developed a tiny hairline crack. You know how it's a fad for kids to have a cracked screen on their phones? That would not work here. The touch part of the screen ceases to function. Luckily, I had an OTG cable and can hook up a mouse (or even a mouse/keyboard combo), but forget any touch-screen control. So, $90 goes for a new screen/digitizer, along with an hour of work, I am told, and I will be back in business. Luckily, there are any number of resources available on how to do the job. (If I enjoy the work, I might start a side business around fixing N7 screens.)"

But it had dead Pixels. I complained to Amazon and a replacement was sent promptly. I was asked to send the Google Nexus 7 Tablet (7-Inch, 32 GB, Black) by ASUS (2013) before December 2013. As the package was delivered by ARAMEX I sent it back through ARAMEX. Today (06-12-13) I got a message from Amazon that they have not got it back. A better feedback could have helped me. Also I spent Rs 4300/- (US$ 70) to send it back and I will get a credit for US$ 20/- only.

B00DVFLJKQ,197,1967,GPS Failure; Touchscreen Intermittantly Unresponsive,Lance Magillicuddy,2,Yes,08-Aug-13,9,0,"THE GOOD: The screen is beautiful; bright and crisp.

THE BAD: I have set up many Android devices with no problems; usually up and running in a few minutes. In this case, there was some issue initially connecting to WiFi; the problem is that you can't get past the ""Connect to WiFi"" screen during setup. At the location in question there are many computers and devices connected to the particular WiFi with no problems so it was the NEXUS 7 device, not the router. After several reboots, a factory reset and 45 minutes of hassle, including internet research to assess the problem, the device recognized the WiFi signal and updated itself.

The touchscreen was intermittently unresponsive, or required a second or third tap to respond. Not often, but enough to be annoying and for me to notice. The worse problem is that the GPS would fail to maintain a lock on the satellite signal after five or ten minutes. This apparently is now a known problem, and a Google search reveals many people identifying the same issue.

The bottom line is the device is attractive and the screen is excellent, but apparently it is not quite ready for prime time. Without knowing when or if Google plans to release a software fix, or if it is a hardware issue, I returned the device. I would buy it again if the two issues are resolved."
B00DVFLJKQ,197,1968,great android tablet missing external memory slot,AYMAN K.,4,Yes,07-Jan-14,-,0,Would have given it 5 if it had the external slot for memory. Stock android is OK although Samsung added some useful apps in their note series that Google seriously needs to evaluate. For me the size was a main player in selecting this tablet. I wanted something that I can carry around in my pocket. Although the actual screen size would be increased by reducing the frame.
B00DVFLJKQ,197,1969,Disappointed....,Clara,1,Yes,03-Jan-14,2,0,"I'm extremely disappointed with the Nexus 7 device I received. I did my research, read reviews, and I thought I was getting a top notch device. I'm gonna get straight to the point of all the things wrong with my device. Touch screen is selective on the apps and function buttons. At first the ""settings"" icon was working well. I thought I was able to set up my N7 how I wanted it. I attempted to adjust the mouse/cursor because it was extremely sensitive when typing. But it only got worse. The lock screen doesn't unlock easily. It takes a few tries to finally unlock the screen. I have a gazillion notifications at the top screen which I'm unable to check using the notification shortcut. I am unable to set up Google Now because the ""next"" tab is not functioning. The email icon is not working. Let's just put it this way....about 90% of my icons aren't working properly. I click and click on them and nothing happens. I can't even get to the default apps since they aren't on my home screen and ""my apps"" icon doesn't work.

I did some further research once I noticed all these issues. It seems N7 2013 requests an update and that update destroys a working device causing long presses, double clicks and losing track of touch/finger.

I just received this device today. Obviously I opened it up immediately and began setting it up. It was to my dismay to discover I have a non-working device. I have no other choice but to return the device. I'm debating on exchanging for another N7 or select another device, such as a Samsung Tab or Kindle Fire."

I also find that the ecosystem is richer in the iOS world but that is rather a defficiency with Android not Nexus. On the over all I am still very satisfied with my purchase.

B00DVFLJKQ,203,2026,Great tablet,Addled,5,Yes,07-Dec-15,-,0,"I love this tablet. I haven't had any issues with it. I bought a case and once in awhile, the tablet screen will turn off if I push on the left side but I figured out that it was from the case and not the tablet itself. I mainly bought the tablet for reading since I was sick of reading books on my phone. I put a matte screen protector on and it's perfect for reading. I'm debating on buying one for my son."

If you don't already have one - I'd say it's a no-brainer. Slim, fast and the latest tech for not too much money. I wanted to say how kick ass it is compared to the previous iteration, but it's not. The OTA update already put 4.3 on the 2012 model. Google wallet is gone on the new 7. Not sure if I'll ever use the Rear camera on this thing. ""Stereo"" only works in landscape rotation. The higher resolution is nice, but I can't really tell too much difference from the 2012 model. Biggest thing to be happy for is 32g of storage. But the 2012 models have that too..."
B00DVFLJKQ,204,2033,Better Than iPad !,Nick C.,5,Yes,24-Oct-13,1,0,"ASUS did a wonderful job on this tablet. i do admit that i am an Apple guy (i own iphone,macbook,mac,ipad,iod, etc.) and Apple lost in the tablet battle.

B00DVFLJKQ,205,2041,Google Nexus 7 keeps rebooting and is unusable,Martin Struik,1,Yes,03-Sep-13,6,3,"After unboxing and fully charging the Nexus 7, at first start-up the brand new nexus 7 started to reboot constantly with approximately 1 min. intervals.
Resetting the Nexus, updating it and running it in safe mode didn't help.

A quick search on the internet learned that this is a known issue both Google and Asus are struggling with.
It has been over a month since this issue has been raised to Google and Asus and no solution is available yet.

I am returning the Nexus 7 and are going for the refund...a non functioning brand new tablet seems to me an indicator of poor QA processes and testing cycles. I'd rather buy something else than getting a Google/Asus product again.

For those who are still going to buy the Nexus 7...please thoroughly read through the various forums/blogs before you make a decision to buy this unstable tablet."

Flexible, easy to use right out of box",EH,5,Yes,28-Oct-13,1,0,"Easy to find settings, google apps that are bundled, nifty note making app called KEEP runs circles around evernote's functionality. Easy to use. Can tether it to a cell phone to catch internet when not in wi-fi range. No lag. can use it on blackboard sites. The most flexible piece in my technology toolkit!
NOTE TO AMAZON: shipping package was crushed, and so was Nexus 7 box. Good packaging by Nexus means the item wasn't damaged, but your shipping didn't protect it."
B00DVFLJKQ,205,2046,Great tablet for the price,Dave Marshall,5,Yes,16-Sep-13,1,0,"When compared with the Ipad mini my friend just purchased, the Nexus outshines it for $200 less. I have a Mac Book Pro so it is not that I deny Apple product form and function, the IPad mini is a solid device, the Nexus does the same thing with higher resolution and longer battery life. The only short coming is the number and quality of the apps available are not at the same lvl as Apple."
B00DVFLJKQ,205,2047,Not the best,Amazon Customer,1,Yes,25-Oct-13,2,0,"Liked to previous version better, felt better in your hand.
The size is awkward, Too small for a tablet, too big for a phone. 8 inch would be much better.
No flash for the camera, but the camera is not good enough to work well without a flash.
No slot for memory is a hassle.
All in all, I will go with the Samsung next time.

Update,
I should have gone with the Samsung. This pos died at exactly 13 months, just out of warranty, and immediately after it upgraded to Lollypop 5.0

The free shipping also helps to made up my mind. Price wise, it's cheaper, as I can only get the 16 gab for what I've paid. I like it, the screen is great and the speed is wonderful. I tried it with Riptide and it was super smooth. Love it! Warranty is not an issue as it's international. Only thing is that you need an adapter for the charger."

B00DVFLJKQ,207,2064,"One of the top tablets for Android, Excellent Purchase!",Justin,5,Yes,14-Apr-14,-,0,"If you're looking for anything else other than the mainstream iPad, look no further. This is it.

I enjoy every single day waking up to this device, it's like like when I first got my Galaxy S4, only 10 times better. Reading news and consuming social media on it is a joy. The screen is big enough, and it is a nice fit in your hand like a book because it is less wide than other tablets.

Finding reasons to use this tablet has never been easier, as you will find yourself using it hours on end, searching the Playstore to fill it up with any useful apps you can find. Using Pocket to save articles for offline viewing later, Pinterest to save your likes are just some examples of how better it can be utilized.

Battery life is also good. If you use it sparingly, it will last you 2-3 days before a needing a recharge. If used extensively, it can even last a day or 2. The colours and vividness of the tablet pops out, so movies/games are good to go.

In conclusion, the power and smoothness of this tablet will win you over, as with many numerous reviews on the internet has proved it to be an excellent, lean, powerful paper-thin device."

Not including a micro SD port is absolutely an Apple type move. Basically forces you to buy the 32GB version.

B00DVFLJKQ,207,2067,Nexus 7 Review,Ben,5,Yes,17-Sep-13,1,0,I absolutely love this thing. Its not to big and not to small. The only disappointment is no expandable SSD card or HDMI mini port.
B00DVFLJKQ,207,2068,Just the right size,isypecs,5,Yes,16-Sep-13,1,0,"Perfect size to read books and email. Recommend case with strap for hand to facilitate stability.
Screen resolution is unbelievably clear and sharp which is the main reason I bought this tablet versus the Samsung Galaxy Tab.
Price is also major incentive to buy this model. Very glad I waited for the 2013 model to debut."
B00DVFLJKQ,207,2069,Awful quality,Vitaliy K.,1,Yes,20-Mar-14,2,0,"The first one was returned due to the faulty screen that would not recognize taps, the second one has a loose contact in the charger slot and does not charge unless the charger cord is in a very specific position.
Stay away."

B00DVFLJKQ,208,2072,Four Stars,Nived,4,Yes,04-Sep-14,-,0,Great android tablet ...screen quality is amazing and the OS so smooth ... great feel ..
B00DVFLJKQ,208,2073,Welcome to replacing your household laptop and gaming handheld with a Nexus 7 HDF,Sebastian Schulz,5,Yes,28-Aug-13,1,1,"If you used your laptop or PC primarily for doing paperwork, watching YouTube videos, making Skype calls, doing social media work, editing photos in a basic way, reading news, reading e-books and a little bit of gaming by yourself or playing casual MMOs - this device will make your life easier. The hardware is at the point where gaming starts to become even graphically emersive and the Google apps and services can do now whatever your document and spreadsheet editors have done in the past. You can share the device with your family, having independent accounts. Every printer company with a name has an app to queue documents from an Android tablet onto your printer.

And the price point makes it a great entry to the world of tablets, apps and touch controls - which are clearly the future of computing in small and mid range.

But even if the performance is great and the screen is the clearest and the most crisp one you will get today on a mobile device of this size: it is not an entertainment center replacement. You can watch Netflix, YouTube or Hulu on your TV with 1080p using just the Nexus 7 HDF + Chrome Cast and a WiFi connection. You can connect the stereo out to actual Hi-Fi stereo speakers for listening to music with decent sound, while having everything streaming from the cloud. But the quality is not what you would want inside the living room. For travelling, camping, touring, trains, bus rides, lunchtime breaks and inside the bedroom it's perfect. But for a family's living room it's not quite there yet in terms of delivering highest quality. On the other hand it is also a great replacement for your bookshelves - providing a large selection of e-books and a high quality reader app.

If you don't have access to the internet on a regular basis day by day, most of the above mentioned, positive aspects are weakened, because Android's heart beats in the web. Without WiFi + Web the Nexus 7 is just a sophisticated mp3 player, average digi cam, gaming handheld, alarm clock and e-book reader.

P.S.: IMHO a must buy for every Android/Mobile/Web Developer interested in the near future of their trade, and/or Gadgeteer. You can peer this little companion with almost every other device, making it a portable console, a cloud storage gateway, an automated scheduler, a testing device, with tricks even a mini server because Google cared to make it the easiest Android device to be savely rooted and modified in terms of software and operating system accessability. The Android SDK is fast understood by every programmer and software designer. Android Updates come in fast - even in lower web density zones you'll get the most recent update delivered within a month after release."

its small and compact, has good battery life. i don't really take photos so the cameras just fine for me. I read ebooks and browse the net with it, have not encountered any issues. An occasional game while on my ride on the train. well rounded enjoyment."

Bought the Nexus 7 for my parents and having to set up the device for their usage, I can only say that the Google Android's ecosystem is simply great!

Delivery to my country (Singapore) is understandably slow which is 3-4 weeks after purchase. But the condition of the product upon delivery is very good as compared to some of the online shops."

Charged it overnight on a working usb charger, but the machine just did not want to turn on no matter what I tried. I am really disappointed for the fact that hardware built is bad that it only lasts about three months. Who knows when my other machine goes down. I want to buy a machine to replace the broken one, and I am not sure if I want another nexus."

B00DVFLJKQ,209,2084,Very handy,Nishi,5,Yes,05-Aug-13,1,0,"The size, display and power aspects are just perfect. I am still trying to figure out what may be better except that the top and bottom could have been a bit thinner."
B00DVFLJKQ,209,2085,Worth The Upgrade From Original Nexus 7,J. Anderson,5,Yes,27-Jul-13,2,0,"I had the original Nexus 7 prior to this updated model. I love the 7"" size for many reasons but bottom line is it's perfect for portable consumption. The downsides to the original were standby battery life, washed out colors (although very crisp resolution), and slow charging.

I received my tablet today and have been playing with it all day. First impressions:

- Amazing Screen!! It's literally like eye candy from the high resolution wall papers, to icons, to video. Watch something beautifully shot like Planet Earth, and be prepared to be in awe. Colors are rich and vibrant, and blacks are black, as they should be.

- Faster so far. Even with multiple updates running in the background, it ran 1080p video flawlessly and easily rotated from portrait to landscape and back. Boot time seems faster too.

- WiFi and Downloads at blistering speeds; Updates to apps over same N router I had before are literally 5X faster.

- Stereo, loud speakers. The original Nexus 7 had decent audio but it didn't have enough power and was mono. Now the amp has been upped and it's pumping two very good sounding speakers out of such a thin package.

- Thinner and lighter. Reading the specs, I kind of laughed when early reviewers gave the stats. But upon holding it, I can really tell the difference and it feels perfectly balanced. Build quality is on par with prior model, which in my opinion was very good.

- Battery Life - It's early, but so far after two system updates, something like 40 apps downloaded and installed, one hour of HD video watched, and four hours of playing around with the screen on, it still has 68% battery left. Overnight in standby, the charge only went down by 1%, so it's pretty clear battery life has improved substantially. I think the more efficient processor coupled with faster processing times (less CPU cycles) has helped a lot.

- Android 4.3. The biggest feature for me is the restricted account mode. For my young children, I can give them a sub-account to mine, with only limited app access. It's perfect since I've already paid for apps on my Android phone for their use and don't want to repurchase for a 2nd account. Also, since they are young, I feel more comfortable with them only having access to approved apps. You can even turn off the browser and Google search so they don't get into trouble.

I'll do a second update on standby battery time (supposed to have improved considerably) and charge time, as well other findings over the coming days. Also, while I would not trash my old one and drop $269 on this one, considering you can sell your original on Ebay or elsewhere for probably 70% of what you paid, in my opinion it is definitely worth the upgrade. You will not be disappointed."

People with a fully serviceable tablets can use OTG installing special program that doesn't need a root. My tablet doesn't respond to the connected OTG-cable. So I have a defective tablet.

Pros:
Faster, lighter, HD screen, access to more apps, front and rear camera.

Cons:
No parental controls built in. Off/on button could be easier to push."

No fix in sight,Bryan Coleman,1,Yes,10-Dec-13,7,1,"When I first received this tablet, the gps worked fine. several weeks later after an upgrade it quite working. Google Play instructed me to do a factory reset. I did and the gps came back for a week. Now I am not getting gps again and its worthless as a navigational device which is one of the main reasons I purchased it. Amazon no longer will allow me to return it. Google Support is not there. I'm very disjointed in it."

And at pretty much half the price that makes it a no brainer. It's a perfect size to throw in your bag or pocket and can be used anywhere. I struggle to give this tablet something that will slow it down, it will play games smoothly and multitask quickly and efficiently. It's a pleasure to browse the internet and immerse yourself in media. The best part of this product is the screen. It is better than the Retina screens on the ipads, and leagues ahead of the iPad mini. Android continues to develop and integrate with Google's other software and you are guaranteed quick updates as it is a Nexus device. If you want a 7 inch tablet then buy this because it is the best never mind cheaper than everything else.

Just to clarify this review was written before the new iPad Mini Retina and iPad Air."

Actually the problem was likely that it couldn't even hold a charge when idle. The new Nexus 7 FHD (codename FLO) isn't having any of that nonsense. I own the Wifi version, and use my cellphone as a hotspot for my web needs (T-Mobile unlimited internet for $40 FTW). This setup lasts me around 9 hours (accumulated, not continuous use), which is when my phone starts to whine at me for not charging it. And this badass can still take more gaming/socializing.

B00DVFLJKQ,214,2140,Such a great tablet,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,21-Aug-13,2,0,"Not only is the 2013 edition of the Nexus 7 more responsive than the previous one, but its screen is also sharper and it has a camera on the back. I only had the 2012 edition for two months but in that time it became very slow, unresponsive, and sometimes the screen would act like it was being touched when it was not. This Nexus 7 is much, much better, and although it occasionally hesitates, it is as fast as any phone or tablet I've ever seen.

As someone who has also owned the original iPad and every iPod touch Apple has made except for the 2012 model, I can tell you that the responsiveness as well as the logical and customizable user interface of Android is a great fit for the Nexus 7. This tablet showcases the strengths of the best mobile operating system on the market is a great way to use apps and play games.

Highly recommended."

Next, the screen cracked even though fully protected in a case and no one did anything significant to the product. Have now read several reviews regarding the product where many people have the same issue. I would not recommend purchase without an extended protection warranty as the manufacturer will not repair without charging $200. Have had an iPad for 2 years now, being used by three elementary age boys, which has had no issues. Will be looking for a different product to replace this."

B00DVFLJKQ,215,2145,Fatal Screen Problems,Phillip Hopper,1,Yes,12-Nov-13,3,2,"This review has nothing to do with the performance of Amazon. The Nexus 7 (32 Gig model)was shipped and received quickly after ordering. Performance of the Nexus 7 was another matter. Less than 90 days after booting the Nexus 7, the touch screen functions completely froze. I could not even turn the tablet off to preserve a charge on the battery.

If this was a one-person problem, it would be bad enough. However, a Google search identified dozens of videos and owner complaints about problems with X screen freezes and touch screen failure. Google's response to customer complaints was ""a fix is being developed and will be available for upload"". Perhaps a helpful solution if a customer could log in to the Nexus 7, which I could not.

One offered solution was to do a factory reboot which completely erased all owner data. Not a helpful suggestion when you have spent 2 months adding 10 Gigs of pictures, documents, and other personal data.

So, a warning to those thinking about purchasing a Nexus 7. Read some reviews and watch videos about Nexus 7 screen problems before you purchase.

I now have a useless $249 tablet tucked away in a drawer, and plan to go to an Apple Mini IPad like my wife purchased.

Summary: Good purchasing experience , horrible and frustrating user experience."

This thing is just as buggy & laggy & what makes it worse is the fact that this is pure Android. The tablet is very slow to move across my various home screens, it takes several touches on the screen before it registers my touch, there's a block to prevent you from using the bass booster on google music, the device has crashed several times, all within the first day & in various applications (Chrome, Google +, etc.), and the screen, which is supposed to be the piece de resistance, doesn't look any better than the screen on my Samsung Galaxy Note 8.

Supposed to be the pure android tablet with really good specs. However - upon opening the box plugging in and fully powering up. Pressing power that's when I realized this was defective. The screen just went off -before I could finish typing in my daughter's screen name and password. I purchased this tablet as reward for her making honor roll again and her birthday isn't far off. I thought I must have hit the power button somehow though I don't know how I could have. When I clicked the power button to turn screen back on nothing happened. Full power -mind you. Long story short this things a dog. It doesn't stay on more than a couple minutes before you get black screen no matter what you are doing. I don't want to try another one. I just want my money back for this ""hot mess"" and the screen protectors and the case I bought with it. Already have Kindle Fire HD. Guess I will get Kindle Fire HDX for her instead of this disaster. Asus and Google thanks for nothing your nnames are mud around this house. Ever after I will read the bad reviews first.

B00DVFLJKQ,219,2187,Not quite ready for prime time?,gebanks,3,Yes,09-Aug-13,3,0,"GPS is flaky, and apparently it is not just mine, many others are reporting it.
Screen looks quite nice, better than iPad mini.
Seems slow starting up, slower than iPad.
Android still does not have the sophistication of iOS, but it is improving.
Good value, once they fix the GPS bug.

Round 2: I returned the 1st tablet to Amazon, and they replaced it with another one, but the GPS was not working on this one either. Apparently, the problem is with firmware, and Google this week (August 22, 2013) released a fix in the form of a new system update, JSS15Q. The next problem I faced in fixing my tablet was that unlike Apple, Google can take months to roll the updates out to all the tablets. Just triggering settings > check for update reports that the tablet is up to date, when it really isn't. Fortunately, on the Internet I found a method to FORCE the tablet to update the firmware to the latest version. Since Amazon doesn't permit URLs in reviews, I can't tell you where to find it, but if you do a Google search with terms android, force and update, you will find it at the lifehacker website. I won't put the steps to update here, but it is quite simple and worked on the first try for me. My GPS worked and I am happy with the Nexus. So far, I haven't found any other problems with the new Nexus, but I still give it a three star review because Google/Asus should certainly have done enough testing to find out that the GPS didn't work before releasing the tablet. End users should not have to fix their own tablet by going to Google forums and finding out how to do it themselves. So be warned, if you want to buy this tablet, it is a nice one, but be prepared to fix it.

Incidentally, calling Google support didn't help. They could confirm that my GPS wasn't working, and suggested I send it in for warranty repair, but they would not admit there was any problem with the Nexus in general, despite there being hundreds of postings on their forum about the GPS problem. Finally, last week, someone from Google came onto the forum and said they were releasing the update that should fix the GPS, but until then, all was silent. I have to admit that this is standard corporate policy, not just with Google (not admitting faults with their product until forced).

After updating again, the GPS now works. I like the tablet now that the software/hardware is working together. Don't let this review stop you from buying it now."

Like:

+ Small size, thinner and lighter than the original, the HD screen looks amazing and is comfortable to hold, feels like a more expensive product
+ It has a GPS, unlike the more expensive competition
+ Faster than before, the new SOC and 2GB RAM make it feel like it had Blast Processing
+ Good quality stereo speakers
+ NFC and according to iFixit, it supports wireless charging
+ Came with 50% charge and lasted for some hours, even downloading all my Apps from Google Play

Dislike:

- Doesn't include a cleaning cloth as advertised (package was perfectly sealed)

Misc:

* Doesn't have a microSD slot, this isn't a problem for me, but a lot of people like to have a choice when deciding on their device's storage
* People says it charges slowly, but mine doesn't have that problem, maybe some chargers are defective?
* It requires you to connect to a wireless network the first time you turn it on to download an Android 4.3 update"

The update installed easily and now it's running 4.3 without a hitch! I really don't see any reason(why was i even considering this option?) one would need to spend a lot of money on an overpriced Apple 8inch tablet,please don't do it...buy a 10 inch Retina iPad if you want an Apple tablet, shame on Apple for giving us this 8 inch version of the iPad. I don't have one complaint about this device, added storage can be done with an OTG cable so that you can add large files such as movies for long trips to a USB thumb drive. Or copy documents to Web based storage sites such as Dropbox or other types of cloud storage providers. The screen, OMG!!! so beautiful!!! games, movies, music and documents look and play brilliantly.Super fast on any task, app whatever you want it to do, web browsing is so quick. So do yourself a favor and just add this device to your Amazon cart and buy it ""Right Now""...i swear you will not be disappointed."

If these types of ""enhancements"" are updated and restored, my overall view would improve but so far I am underwhelmed. I just hope that Google executives are taking note of the opinions that users are expressing and appreciate that amongst the noise is genuine feedback."

B00DVFLJKQ,224,2239,Poor Asus Service,Super User,1,Yes,18-Oct-13,4,2,"The tablet is great for the most part. However, mine does not seem to wirelessly charge like many others have reported. If you did not buy the tablet directly from the Google Play store, then you have to have it serviced by Asus (and you have to pay to ship it out to them). UPS shows Asus received my tablet on 10/3/13 (RMA USG7397854). Asus says they need 5-7 days to evaluate and repair. It is now 10/18/13. I have spoken with two separate supervisors and neither has been able to give me a definitive update as to when I can expect to receive it back. The first supervisor actually told me that there may be a ""discrepancy with the case"" and that I may be charged for repairs?! Don't know how that is possible for an item still completely under warranty and only a few weeks old that is otherwise in mint condition but I found that statement to be pretty ridiculous. The second supervisor says that it will take 1-2 business days to get a response from the repair facility. Again, very poor customer service. This is my second Nexus 7 tablet (still own the 2012 first generation) and also have an Asus UX31a ultrabook. All I can say is that with service like this, Asus you just lost a very loyal customer as I will never be purchasing another Asus product again."

It's best to buy it from Amazon versus the Google store because you get free shipping and no taxes (but right now, Google has free shipping for a limited time).
Pros:
- best value for the money
- incredibly fast processor
- sharp colors and images
- very good sound quality
- lighter and thinner than the previous model
- front and rear facing camera
- Google Play has more apps than Amazon
Cons:
- back side looks cheap compared to the first model where the back had a luxurious looking and feeling texture
- no LTE version yet
- no 10"" version yet
- no mini SD card slot

B00DVFLJKQ,226,2255,Disappointed with Google,ontheroadjg,4,Yes,22-Sep-13,1,0,"I am returning the Nexus 7 with regret. The hardware is very good but I can't live with the compromises that android requires. Adobe flash is not supported or apparently forthcoming. The work-around is functional, but the resolution is fuzzy (why have HD if you can't use it?) and the performance is iffy. I couldn't even use my Prime to see videos until I installed the work-around. Meanwhile google has warned you any other apps other theirs may damage the unit. . Forget copying your music from your computer. So everything you have coming from windows has to be repurchased or jury rigged. I wasn't ready for this and so it is my fault, not that the Nexus 7 doesn't work. You just have to start afresh with this purchase."

Checking mail and what else? Can't even play proper sound when i plug it to the speakers, movies? no way, limited subtitels... Over all it has many problems and can't get rid of the feeling that all appsthat are ofering better experience just want to survail my pesonal data. Probably this is the main reason why such devices exists."
B00DVFLJKQ,226,2257,One Star,toni dinkins,1,Yes,30-Dec-14,-,0,It broke
B00DVFLJKQ,226,2258,Almost 5 stars,Rayn Drahps,4,Yes,31-Jul-13,28,6,"This device is a solid upgrade from the previous generation. I'm sure there's lots of in depth reviews that will be helpful, but from my angle this device is perfect except for the continued inability to play Amazon VOD/Prime movies on the table. This is an Amazon and a Google problem which is why I include it in my review. Google refused continued support of Flash, meanwhile Amazon won't create an Android app that works with their streaming service. (Leaving my original mistake in place, but I was corrected. Adobe is the one who discontinued support for mobile versions of Flash. This can no longer be considered a fault of the device. I have also just learned that Firefox on the Android market enabled Flash support again. Download the Flash APK from Adobe's archive site, download Firefox, log into Amazon VOD/Prime, watch your show! Full rez looked possible, the shows looked great with a 4 bar connection. Hopefully this will work with Chromecast.)

My other complaint is that the Netflix HD app is still pretty grainy. Not sure if that's a Netflix issue or not. I have really high bandwidth, easily enough for 720p but it seems like 480p or lower resolution, even when I allow a movie to cache for a while. (Edit: 08/01/2013 it didn't seem so bad, but I'm not sure if it actually got better or not.)

New worry, not so much a complaint which leaves this at 4 stars. The drop test videos I've seen are horrendous. Buy a case asap seems to be the motto now. Sadly, not a lot of good case options yet and I don't think either of the 2 official cases are going to have the magnetic locking feature which is a big WTF to ASUS.

Those complaints aside, some of which aren't completely the fault of the tablet, this thing would get 5 stars. So freaking fast and fluid.

Edit: After having this a few days, weight is a big factor. As in the weight reduction put into this one is huge. I seem to find varying figures but Wiki shows the previous gen at 340g and the new gen at 290g so I'll go with those figures. That 50g difference makes it so holding it up in front of me while laying in bed less painful. I have fibromyalgia and have 2 herniated discs in my neck so I could only hold the first gen one for about 1-2 minutes in that position without starting to experience numbness and pain flareups. Now I barely notice I'm holding anything at all. It feels like the weight of a standard console game controller, maybe even lighter (in the case of the xbox controller that has 2 AA batteries.)

Also, not sure why this wasn't reviewed as helpful. There's full breakdown reviews out there, my review pinpoints a few things that aren't covered in those that I found needed talking about and also my first experiences with this device."

Deciding between Kindle and Nook and the concern of not being able to get contents when he travel stop me from buying them and chose this. And i have to say i never regretted it!

From the owner of it, he commented this is possibly the best small size tablet he have used before other than iPad Mini.
Customizable system with up to date technical specification made other tablets pale.
Small handy size with beautiful resolution that makes small text very readable.

B00DVFLJKQ,229,2286,Thousands of owners report Nexus 7 tablet bricked by Lollipop update,Tom Anderson,1,-,11-May-15,41,7,"Before you decide to buy this tablet, google ""nexus 7 freezes at Google logo."" There are thousands of complaints on the Internet about the Nexus 7 (both editions), and sometimes the Nexus 5, being bricked by the Lollipop update. This is apparently what happened to mine. I woke up one Monday to discover it frozen at the Google logo (which appears during boot-up). It is impossible to get past that point. So far as I can tell, it had just upgraded itself to Lollipop 5.0.2, and froze when rebooting. At least, that's what many, many other people reported as the cause of the problem. I've tried every cure I could find on the Internet with no luck. And even worse, neither Google nor Asus will do anything about the problem unless it happens while you are still in warranty. Since I bought my tablet early after its release, I've had it about a year and a half now. When it works, it's very nice. My wife's still works, even upgraded to Lollipop 5.1.1. But mine seems forever stuck on the Google logo. Asus reportedly wants $200+ to fix the problem, and Google just says, ""Too bad,"" when they say anything--even though I bought both tablets directly from the Google Play Store. At present I'm awaiting a motherboard from China to replace the motherboard in the tablet, which seems to be the recommended solution. I'm hoping it will work, but if it doesn't I'll have to buy another tablet (NOT a Nexus this time)."

B00DVFLJKQ,230,2292,Defective out of the box,Mr D,1,Yes,08-Aug-13,12,1,"Opened the box with great excitement. No startup instructions but figured out how to turn on. Could not get past setup, called Google Tech support and spent over 45mins with them. They told me to send it back. I kept trying and made sure I was near (within feet) of solid WiFi and finally got through setup. The issue is that it connects to the network and says it has a ""full"" signal. However when you try to do anything it tries to connect then to the online service and the connection drops. Finally got the 4.3 OS downloaded and was hoping that would fix it. No such luck. I really gave it a good try. Now I am waiting for my RMA.

Update 21Aug2013- OK, I got my RMA from the seller, ANTONLINE. However they wanted me to pay a 25% restocking fee. They said that they were going to take an equal hit on the price because they could not re-sell it as new. First of all, they certainly did not pay the same price for the device as I did, and did they think I was joking when I said it didn't work and the Service Techs told me to return it. I even had a copy of the chat with those comments. Well, I had to file a claim with Amazon through their A-to-Z Guarantee service. The immediate official response from Amazon was that they would review my case and get back to me in 1-2 weeks. I went back and reread the ANTOLINE fine print on their RMA offer only to discover that they only give you 10-days to return an item; you also need EVERY piece of protective film, undamaged boxes, even the original packing slip. I will NEVER buy from ANTONLINE again. Amazon did come through and within the time needed to return the tablet. Now I am only out the cost of 2-day UPS shipping the unit back. Thanks Amazon for standing by your customers"
B00DVFLJKQ,230,2293,"Outstanding 7"" Tablet",C C,5,Yes,28-Jul-13,4,15,"This is my first 7"" tablet, so I wasn't sure what to expect prior to receiving it. I've been very impressed so far with the tablet in several different ways:

Screen: Awesome. I've seen reviews say that the 1920x1200 resolution on a 7"" screen is overkill, but honestly I don't think that is the case. Watching HD videos on Youtube and Netflix has been excellent. The picture is super sharp and colors and contrast are very good. I'm not a videophile, so maybe there are some flaws I'm not picking up on, but I have absolutely no complaints based on my usage.

Performance: I've not noticed any detectable lag. The system is initially a little slow while the Google content syncs (apps, contacts, etc), but once that initial sync was completed, it has been absolutely smooth. Multitasking is great, applications load quickly, and web browsing is flawless. I played The Legends of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on an N64 emulator for a little bit, and the game play appeared completely smooth.

Battery: I have 5.5 hours of screen ""on"" time, most of which was spent installing applications, streaming videos on Youtube, playing games, and web browsing. My battery is at 36% capacity (started at 100%). I consider this excellent. I wouldn't normally use a tablet this much in a single day, so I could see getting a week of normal usage between charges.

Ergonomics: Very good. I've seen people complaining about the bezel size, but they clearly don't understand that the bezel was a functional design decision. They provide a hand hold when using the device oriented horizontally. Holding the device vertically is pretty easy since it's small enough to hold in one hand (depends on hand size). The back has a nice, grippy soft material to help prevent slippage.

Overall, the tablet has blown me away. Performance is way better than I expected. Size is a perfect mix of portability and usability. Screen and battery life leave nothing (for me at least) to desire. I'd enthusiastically recommend this to someone looking for an inexpensive, high quality, 7"" tablet."

It has rebooted in safe mode and also I have factory restored several times. i have tried several areas as to not do the update of OS, take and delete all the apps except one and still rebooted. I tried a different app when I restored it again and it still rebooted. Must have a hardware problem. I bought a 16gb and a 32gb and both have the same issue. I am returning both tablets.

The seller gave me so much trouble. Andromeda camera told me that I could not return the item after I already sent it in to be returned. After that, they told me that they would have to charge e a restocking fee after they decided if something was wrong with the item. Then,, after a three weeks of waiting, they email me stating that they can't accept the return because the charger isn't the correct one even though I never took the charger out of the box. I contacted Amazon right away and they are currently helping me to sort this whole mess out. Note that it has been nearly a month by this point and they haven't sent the Nexus back to me even though they won't refund me.

In fact none with the ipad so far. I could clearly hear a static hissing noise coming out of the speakers. It stayed there for full one hour. When I switched back in the morning it was gone. The colors on the screen don't look vibrant. If you try to pull down the screen when it can't be pulled any further, I noticed a kind of color spill on the top or bottom of the screen depending on which way the screen was pulled. In the middle of running a video, the tablet got switched off on its own for no reason. In fact never did I get an impression that I was using a premium product. I also think the wifth of the tablet is very small so that nothing meaningful can be done holding it in portrait mode."

B00DVFLJKQ,232,2316,Best bang for your buck,Amazon Customer,5,Yes,27-Jul-13,4,0,I got my Nexus 7 2013 today and everything is perfect on it. I still have last years Nexus 7 and was very happy with it. The new one is definately an upgrade and well worth it. You are going to find a better tablet with the same specs for the price.
B00DVFLJKQ,232,2317,This was the worst tablet I ever had,K. Ferguson,1,Yes,30-Dec-13,2,0,"I got this because I was tired of the 10"" Transformer Prime. It was not good for playing games or anything else. It was only good for watching video but too big for everything else. Plus the prime had a performance problem because it only had like 768mb of RAM. So I decided I wanted something smaller. I for the new Nexus 7. Screen resolution is INSANE !!! Best on the market and it is fast as hell. It plays anything I throw at it perfectly.

Now here is why I refunded it. 2 HUGE problems. #1) It intermitently would not get past the load screen, I would let it sit for hours and it would be stuck. Then I would force power it off and on next boot or 3 boots after since sometimes it would still be stuck, it would boot all the say but I would get data corruption and force close errors all over the place. This has happened 4 times since having it. The only workaround is to reset it back to factory defaults. That is UNACCEPTABLE. I lose all my files and settings and apps when I do that. #2) There was a nasty screen problem when I would touch it to do anything. It would only recognize like every 2 touches. I would do anything and it would not register the 3rd touch. When doing normal stuff like surfing the internet or going through the gallery, it was annoying but when I would game on it, it would be unacceptable to me. It made playing games frustrating and impossible.

Keep in mind, I did NOT alter the stock software. Did not root it, did not load any custom kernels or roms and I updated it to the latest software patch and same issues.

I was thinking of exchanging it thinking I just had a defective one but then I read on forums how other people have the same exact issue and exchanged theirs 2, 3, even 4 times before they actually got one that worked the way it was suppose to.

So apparently the way these were made, was very cheap in a way where some of them were going to be defective off the product line. No quality control whatsoever. So I decided to refund it and got a LG G Pad 8.3

I would NOT recommend the Nexus 7 2nd generation to ANYONE !!! But the 1st generation, go right ahead."

It means that if you're trying to navigate a PDF by scrolling with one finger, for example, it will mistake it as two touches, and the PDF will twitch, zooming in and out erratically.

Don't get me wrong, the tablet is very impressive. But I would not have bought it if I knew that the hardware is faulty. Asus needs to step up their quality control. I'd be happy to pay more for a tablet that works. Stay away from this product until Asus resolves the multitouch issue."

B00DVFLJKQ,234,2331,Solid introduction to the Android world.,Callanish,5,Yes,01-Aug-13,68,3,"I'm an IOS user. Have been for a long time. Currently I'm running an iPad 4, Ipod touch 5th gen 64gb and an Iphone 5 with generations of Apple music players also lying around the house, but I wasn't going to just worship at the alter of Apple just because the Mini existed. That low resolution screen was a deal breaker for me, so knowing that I was in the market for a 7 inch tablet, the only one that stood out was the new Nexus 7.

So, my intent was to have it mimic everything that the Ipad 4th generation does with apps, function and see if it could handle itself in the real world, so I put most of the apps that I have on the iPad 4 on the Nexus 7 to see if there was any truth to the limitation of Android apps in the Google Play store. So far, I found them all, except HBOGo with Jellybean 4.3, which isn't compatible yet at this point, nor is the BBC iPlayer, but everything else works fine including apps that run through a VPN or Proxy.

I also use Bluetooth GPS hardware (Dual Electronics XGPS150 ) running Navigon mapping software with this Nexus 7 and have not only been impressed with the clarity of the screen, but everything has worked great as a navigation device so far. My understanding is that there's a GPS issue with the built in GPS that will need an O.S upgrade to fix, but I prefer using my external GPS and so far I've had no problems with Navigation using that external device.

I'm also running the Nexus 7 through a 3G/4G mifi wifi spot and that's also been pretty consistent. No drop offs and it's as quick to web surf as any IOS device.

I've also had a great experience with Seagate's 1TB wireless plus full of movies that I stream and import from the drive to the Nexus 7. With IOS, I use Nplayer, which does the job flawlessly. With the Nexus, I use Es File explorer to access the files on the drive, move them to a folder and play them with B.S player or stream them directly from B.S player through the wi-fi on the device and it's played everything I've thrown at it. Picture quality is great with the 16:9 ratio and sound is much better than on my IOS devices. 4:3 media files playing on the iPad IOS created either a stretched or squashed experience or showed the movie playing with letterbox black bars. Not the best of experiences. The 16:9 format is a much better experience for viewing your media.

The thing I like about the Nexus 7 and maybe now Android in general is it doesn't take the jailbreaking of the device just to do basic things like move around files. Plugging it in to a computer through USB and it shows up as a drive on my Windows P.C makes things really easy to transfer files as does connecting to my LAN to get something off of a connected device. The free ES file explorer app in the Google play store is just an excellent app allowing me to access all my files on the Nexus. I use iFile on my jailbroken IOS devices and Nplayer to run media, but somehow it's not as elegant and easy as it is with Android's open O.S.

For me, the device is pretty solid. I haven't used any Android tablets to compare it with, but the quality is solid, the screen is a huge leap up from the Mini ( friend has one ) and I'd say it has the edge over the Ipad 4. The O.S is pretty snappy. I'd say that IOS still is in front when it comes to the web surfing experience ( the screen's tactile feel with the web feels faster to respond to commands on IOS), but it's still very good on the Nexus and the ability to customize all aspects of Android without resorting to jailbreaking is welcome.

The other noticeable thing is that the ipad 4 now feels big and bulky, and the screens on the iphone and touch now seems too small, so I'm now seeing the benefits of a 7 inch screen which provides better clarity over the smaller IOS devices because of screen size and better portability over the iPad 4 because of its weight and dimensions.

Battery life, so far has been good, and most of the time I don't need the brightness setting so high which maximizes battery life. The only glitch I found was with auto brightness; the screen flickered a bit now and then. Turning that off solved the problem, so it's not a deal breaker for me that the screen is no longer working with auto-brightness. I'm used to that on my 5th generation touch....no auto-brightness setting.

I'll be curious to see in the coming months how the Nexus 7 handles the wear and tear of life. So far, I've had a very positive experience and I really like the form factor, the brilliant screen and the challenge of doing things the Android way rather than the IOS way. Don't get me wrong, I'm still an IOS fan and the iPad 4, iphone 5 and ipod touch 5th gen are excellent devices. I guess I was just getting a bit bored and was looking for something new. Glad I did, because the new Nexus 7 is an excellent device at an excellent price."

It lacks important features. Namely: no flash, and therefore it is often impossible to see even video of online magazines. A flash is available (for mozilla, not chrome) but not full function.
The mini USB door makes it possible to connect the tablet to a computer (master) which writes/reads the tablet disk.

After researching online, I saw that there are a number of others who are experiencing the same issue and there is NO fix from Google at this time.

B00DVFLJKQ,235,2347,"Perfect portable tablet size, and great for Netflix, that's about it",Nate C,3,-,10-Jan-18,2,0,"I've had this since late 2013, so I've had a few years with it using it daily. It's always been in a case and it doesn't really leave the house. It's an older product and I'd say it ages all right. I'll just say this, it does what I want it to do, watch YouTube and Netflix. But that's about it, and it barely does that now. There's issues in YouTube that are still persistent even after a factory reset. It doesn't play 1080p 60 FPS (it's not even an option) but it does do 720p 60 FPS, but the video often freezes while audio continues to play. Only in 60 FPS mode for YouTube. It's not great for web browsing anymore, it's quite slow, and it doesn't play modern 3d games well but that's ok. The two best things this tablet has is the beautiful screen with amazing colors with a resolution ahead of it's time (1920x1200) and stock android (the best android). My two biggest issues (now three in the past five minutes) is that the screen has issues auto rotating. It's been like this for a couple of years and I think it's because the sensors are wonky. With a gyro sensing app, it shows that this device isn't detecting any movement. A restart usually fixes it but it breaks shortly after. Another thing that always breaks is that it doesn't detect touch. Sometimes I can't tap anything, or even unlock it because it doesn't detect my finger. Turning the screen off and on again usually fixes this problem except for today, a few minutes ago. Coincidentally as I'm writing this review, It wasn't detecting touch and I couldn't even press the power off option so I had to force shut it down. Now it won't boot, I keep getting stuck at the ""Google"" screen. I've had this for well over 3 years and the time it breaks is when I'm writing a review! I'm sure the internet has information on fixing this. Lastly, I'm surprised the price hasn't changed. In fact I think I got it for less years ago."

Why do I say that? Well very simple. I'm over in the US from the UK and decided I'd like to get a tablet at last. I cannot fault the Amazon delivery system here one iota, as I got it two days after ordering. Very good, as I've come to expect with Amazon.

What has really hacked me off is that I can't use the damn piece of cr*p. Why? Because I'm in a hotel room and it won't connect to the wifi!! It just gives me a warning that it can't connect to the web site. Doing some research (through the Google website of course) I find that others have had the same problem but unfortunately none of them could give me a coherent solution to fix it.

Now this is the wonderful Google that I've lauded to the high heavens in regard to their search engine. Well let me tell you, on other Android experience, and now this, I think that's where they should stay. Rather leave this sort of thing to the professionals, because frankly, your silly named Jelly Bean or KitKat or whatever software is pathetic if it can't even connect to a hotel wifi.

Really.

24 March 2014 addition:

OK, I've got home from the States and am still finding crap with this product. For a start the 'touchscreen' is certainly not that. Very unresponsive.

And while I can just about manage the Lucky Fish (or whatever stupid name they've called the latest version) operating system on my htc phones, on the Nexus 7 it's useless. Coupled with another of Google's less-successful products, namely gmail, it's absolute rubbish. Talk about a couple of totally-unintuitive systems. To the extent that - while trying to impress my wife with my new purchase - I managed to completely delete an important email and have absolutely no idea where it went.

I'll stick to - god strike me down for saying this - Windows and Yahoo mail.

What a load of crap. I'll use it for doing Google searches - which got me to buy this thing in the first place - and NOTHING ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!!

And to add insult to injury, I now find it doesn't support Flash Player so there's no way I can watch any videos on, for example, the BBC web site! For heaven's sake....."
B00DVFLJKQ,236,2357,Everybody High-Five!,Sirocco,5,-,11-Dec-13,9,0,"What happened, did I just die and go to heaven?

This thing so far exceeds the minimal requirements for 5 stars – its imperfections are slight and more than compensated for (based on 2 days of use).

Its quad-core, surround sound, super thinness, and “Retina” display alone give it a 5 star.

There should be as much buzz for this as for the iPad mini, since the two are equivalent in important ways, with the Nexus 7 actually being better in other ways, including its rubberized back. When I first laid eyes on it I knew I would have it.

SETTING UP
Minutes out of the box (4 minutes), not only were all the apps on my other android device automatically copied over, but the painstakingly designed custom eq settings from the PowerAMP app also. It was a freak out moment. I didn’t have to create a gmail account, it was ALREADY THERE! – with the cool new interface. Because it’s a google device, it just magically retrieved all this from the cloud. It even upgraded to version 4.4 (Kit-Kat), all practically as I was still unboxing it, so freak out.

SCREEN SIZE – at 7 inches, big enough to provide a “big screen” experience while still being small enough to hold in one hand, this may represent the elusive “sweet spot” for screen size where portable multimedia is the priority. I also have a Samsung Galaxy player 5 inch, which I’ve had for over a year with great satisfaction for multimedia and reading the news, and which I will continue to use, and which might even be better first thing in the morning before I put my contacts in and I hold the player only inches from my eyes, where a smaller screen would have an obvious advantage, or also for when I’m just playing tunes. I may actually prefer the UI (user interface) of the Samsung but then again I’m so accustomed to it. Bear in mind I didn’t get the Nexus 7 to replace my Galaxy player 5, which in it’s own way also represents a sweet spot for me in terms of size and usability.

The Nexus 7, because of its bigger screen, allows for greater use of widgets than on smaller screens like my Galaxy 5-inch. I’m just beginning to appreciate that widgets allow for more immediate control of the device, or to display streaming information – that is actually a bigger step forward than I had anticipated when considering my new Nexus 7. With smaller screen sizes you can’t fully exploit the world of widgets!

THINNESS – 8.65 mm. If it was just 1mm thinner it would run the risk of flexing or snapping in two so it would be silly to wait for something thinner. Even most “thin” cell phones in use today are at least 2-3 mm thicker. So if thin is your thing you may as well hoot and holler right now.

IMAGE QUALITY – 323 ppi, compared to 326 on the iPad’s Retina display of the iPhone and iPad Touch. So text and images are, suffice to say, beautiful. The slightly larger iPad mini and even bigger iPads actually have less ppi than this (less resolution). With my contact lenses on and the screen about 12 or so inches from my eyes I can’t see individual pixels even with reading glasses – which is the general assumption of “Retina display,” even though without my contacts and the screen only a few inches from my eyes I can discern individual pixels if I stare at it, but let’s not belabor the issue. The images of this, the Nexus 7 2013 edition, are RAZOR SHARP and YOU WILL LIKE IT!

Incidentally, I have the screen brightness at about 10% and that provides great contrast in subdued lighting indoors (while maximizing battery life). Even outside in sunlight, 100% brightness seems more than enough for a bright, sharp image.

SOUND – At a certain threshold of sound quality, the spirit is moved, and these speakers are at that threshold. As with “Retina” display for the eyes, so it is with Fraunhofer “surround sound” for the ears. You’ll be holding this in one hand while you dance around, as I was while streaming music from the cloud. You do not need to plug into an auxiliary speaker. There are speakers at both the top and bottom of the device, providing surprisingly good fidelity and “surround sound” (as might be expected from the inventors of MP3 technology itself). It practically qualifies as “room filling.” Satisfying for both music and talk. The speakers face the back, and might be better than some of the cheaper plug-in speakers. I haven’t decided if the sound is better facing front or backward. It also has Bluetooth. It’s so great when these devices have speakers, even better when they’re as good as this.

NO SD CARD SLOT
But the built-in 32 GB (actually less) more than compensates for this, and it can be plugged into some external hard drives (or thumb drives) full of movies or other files with a $3 OTG cable. The Nexus 7 is designed to exploit wireless, streaming technologies, not serve as a repository for a movie library. Much multimedia content is streamed and never stored on the device. For music, the incapability to expand this is unlikely to be a problem because it’s too big to be used as a primary MP3 player.

PLUSSES
• It’s rubberized back (actually a hard, black plastic), which makes it easier to hold, and also warmer to the touch. This alone may be worth half a star. I’ve actually dropped my other tablet, the 5-inch Player, a few times over the last year, fortunately always on carpet.
• 5 MP back camera and a 1.2 MP for the front. There’s no flash but the usual assortment of controls. Cameras on tablets are a gimmick and purely for random fun moments. I would never use a 7-inch tablet to take pictures.
• It has other things like NFC and with an adapter can be plugged into your TV with a HDMI cable, there’s just so much potential. There are other cool features too numerous to mention.
• Some of the 3rd party cases carry on the spirit of thinness, and double as an easel – I will probably invest in one of these.
• It has that slippery glass that the fingers like to slide around on, and easier to wipe clean than regular glass or plastic.

CONS
Slight negatives I have already suggested or implied do not really compromise it’s stellar rating. In this case, personal electronics have matured to the point where it is no longer necessary to offer the usual criticisms, so everybody high five."
B00DVFLJKQ,236,2358,better cameras (anything is better than what the Nexus 7 ...,madscientistandartist,2,-,30-Aug-17,-,0,"Okay, so I have one of these and on the surface, it has just about EVERYTHING going for it. It's slim, powerful, has a higher res screen, better cameras (anything is better than what the Nexus 7 earlier versions had!) and a super slick feel. But hold up, there is a beef and a significant one! This cute little beast can die without warning and Google or Nexus will put you through the ringer to fix it. What mine has done, MANY have also done, and the forums are full of dead-ended requests for help that Google can't or won't address. Nexus will stonewall you too. Gods forbid we actually get to USE the tablet for any time longer than its warranty! If your tablet slips beyond its warranty period, and you have a problem with it, I suggest throwing it in the junk drawer and forgetting about it. Both Google and Nexus won't help, and the forums don't have a solution. Just what happened?

Well, mine got bonked on its corner, and the next time I went to start it, it got stuck on the ""Google"" word and refused to go further. No attempts to reboot worked either. It just goes back to the Google screen. To send it back for fixing would require $35 to Google, then an additional $100 + to assess the repair need. That doesn't even factor in the actual repair! In essence, my device is bricked with no option of recovery. There are few things that annoy me more than a product that is designed such that once it fails, you can't do a thing with it. We need better options for handling issues like this! Google and/or Nexus lost me as a cheerleader on this one. I should be able to find an at least reasonable work around so that I can get my tablet up and running again and keep it running until features evolve enough that I want to get a new one. How is it bad thing to keep older Nexii working? Once they go out of warranty, make it possible for us to fix them ourselves. It keeps them out of landfills and helps our environment, since recycling them currently doesn't seem to be an option where I am.

""Planned obsolescence"" is a concept that corporations like because by planning for customers to buy products that are designed to fail within a certain period, thereby ensuring that the customer will be forced to come back and buy another version of the product. I definitely think that's what's going on here, since the injury my tablet sustained (while out of warranty) was relatively small, and the failure is catastrophically fatal. Sorry Google/Nexus. I can't lend my support for a product that cost so much and crapped out so completely. This is a device that is pretty on the surface, but one that will cost you dear to repair or replace far sooner than you should have to."

Like some other users, updates to OS stopped after ~ 1 year, but at least we got 1-2 updates, and haven't really noticed any issues in performance without updates.

B00DVFLJKQ,236,2360,ASUS the brand you can trust -- NEXUS 7 2013 is the best 7 inch tablet!!!,Mr. Quality and Value,5,-,19-May-15,3,1,"In today's tech race, we've been led to believe that a 2 year old or even a 1 year old piece of tech is obsolete. It's a lie in the marketing world known as planned obsolescence. Do you remember a time when there were no ""new purchase insurance""? What happened to quality & value? The secret is today, it's rare, but I'm constantly looking and when I find something, I want to share the info. The internet is a great equalizer. Credit marketers and today's economy for so much crap that we buy, the idea of planned obsolescence drives more purchases and the economy into spending more frequently. The marketer's idea was sold to companies and now it's part of production. If I bought a fridge and it lasts 10 years or more, it's not profitable. It's a clear sign when I'm in the cashier line to pay, haven't even opened the box to the new product yet, and I'm offered the ""what if this breaks"" insurance.
Not the Nexus 7 2013 32GB tablet. This tablet is still, in my humble opinion, one of the best tablets to date. ASUS has won my trust. They consistently make quality products with the consumer in mind. I own the ASUS RT68AC Router, which was the first of it's kind to meet the needs of high tech streaming homes. After this product, the rest of the competition followed suit. I also own ASUS laptops and switches in my home. I'm rarely disappointed with an ASUS product. The Nexus 7 screen is bright and vivid, it's still super snappy, the speakers give ample sound, and the 32gb version offers just enough space if you add cloud storage. This tablet is worth your purchase, and you shouldn't need to compare specs because it works just like it should. Plus you will be the first to get the latest updates from Google, since it's pure Android. I've actually had this tablet for over 2 years, and I'm finally coming around to writing the review because it is necessary. It's a winner."

YOU ARE BEING UNWITTINGLY DRAWN INTO A SCHEME TO DEFRAUD YOUR CUSTOMERS!",sjgadlt,1,Yes,09-Dec-13,10,1,"Touch-pad input on this tablet never worked exactly right. It is a subtle problem which took a long time for me to characterize. I finally found mention of the app ""YAMTT"" in the blogs, downloaded it, and used it to test the tablet. After swiping around for a while in the lower left corner of the tablet, the line being drawn will change from blue to red, indicating that the tablet has decided it is a 2nd rather than the 1st finger being dragged. There is no 1st finger, and the red 2nd finger is the ONLY input being registered. Unfortunately if you are trying to swype or gesture type, the app won't register the ""2nd finger"" as a valid input. So I basically cannot swype-type on this device. It makes it virtually useless, and horribly, terribly, frustrating. It was not obvious what was going on, because it would just interrupt the gesture line and pop a couple of short estimates of words similar to the longer word I was trying to gesture type.

I wasn't entirely sure that this was a failure until I located a friend with a similar Nexus 7, and tried them side-by-side. The bad news is it took a few more than 30 days for me to become fully convinced that this was a faulty device, and now I find that Amazon won't allow me to return it.

After checking in more detail, I find that it is well-known in the Nexus 7 blogs that an entire batch of the touch-input screen devices were faulty, and, in some cases, vendors sold them anyway. This is FRAUD, pure and simple.

I purchased this devices from Amazon proper, not one of the 3rd parties. I cannot believe that Amazon would besmirch their reputation and long-term sales by sticking their customers with a few faulty devices which were known to be failures by the manufacturer. But I cannot find a way to contact a real person at Amazon anymore. Their ""online return system"" simply cycles me through increasingly larger loops which end up saying the device cannot be returned. EVEN ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT AMAZON END IN THIS ON-LINE NIGHTMARE LOOP. I am an early Amazon customer, have always had good experiences with Amazon until now, and am flabbergasted. I cannot believe that Amazon would involve itself in fraud, but how can I believe otherwise if they refuse and actively prevent me from contacting them about this issue? PLEASE, AMAZON, WAKE UP!!!"

Once the 4.3 update downloaded, the tablet did nothing but fall into boot loop after boot loop. I spent hours repeatedly going into recovery, restoring to stock, and starting from scratch. I never rooted this device or downloaded any unknown apps. It seems like the OS and tablet just don't work well together. Sending it back."
B00DVFLJKQ,237,2363,Great product overshadowed by horrible warranty service,Monika,1,-,14-May-14,50,3,"My husband and I have been having problems with warranty service on the 2013 Nexus 7 tablet.

Our device had a blurry rear camera and we sent it in for warranty service for the camera. There was no visible damage on the device when we sent it in. ASUS repaired it and returned it to us. When we received it, the camera worked fine (no more blurriness), the LCD worked fine, however, there was a small crack in the plastic bezel around the outside of the screen. Since the bezel was cracked during the RMA process, we initiated a second RMA to repair the cracked bezel from the first RMA.

We're now in the middle of the second RMA process. ASUS has had the device for two weeks. On Sunday evening (11 May), we received an email indicating that our device had a cracked LCD screen, which was not covered by warranty and we could either pay $200 to replace the LCD or ASUS would return our device to us. The email included a picture of a device with a cracked LCD, however, the datestamp on the image was from 5 days before ASUS received our device, and the device in the picture was clearly not a 2013 Nexus 7 tablet (in fact, we believe it was an ASUS branded 10"" tablet). We immediately responded that the device in the picture was not our device, nor was it the same model as our device, but we have yet to hear back.

At this point, our RMA for the blurry rear camera has taken two RMAs, 6 weeks, and we're concerned that ASUS has lost our device or is otherwise mistracking it. While we have been very happy with ASUS devices so far, we are very frustrated with the ASUS warranty service that we are receiving for this product. We approached a service agent who left his information on an Amazon review on this tablet, and we received a return email saying that they would issue a ""discount"" on the repair. We do not understand why a ""discount"" would even be offered on a device that is clearly not ours. When we called to check on the RMA to see if there was any sort of response to our email, we were told that there was no way to know if the repair facility located our device or where it was in the repair process.

For timeline, this is what we've experienced -
First RMA: for a blurry rear-facing camera
- device shipped on 04 April
- device received 10 April
- device received 18 April

Second RMA: for the bezel that was damaged during the first RMA -- ASUS paid the shipping for this since the damage was caused during the ASUS RMA process
- reported bezel damage on device 18 April (date received from repair facility)
- device shipped 24 April
- device received 30 April
- contacted 09 May on status update of device
- received email regarding cracked LCD 11 May, with a picture of a device that isn't mine and with a timestamped (25 April) photograph that indicates the device was in their facility before my device was received (30 April) by the facility

To this date, we have yet to receive any word on our device, nor an apology for the email or how this has been handled. Trying to get a hold of someone who can actually tell us where our device is and when we can get it back has been a complete nightmare."

Asus wanted $200 to fix it (more than a new one). Google the problem and you will see it is a widespread issue experienced by hundreds. Asus won't acknowledge the issue. I ended up sending it in just to get the repair estimate and submitted that to American Express which automatically added a year to the warranty when I bought it. I then used the claim money to buy parts on eBay and got it working again. One month later it failed for another common issue. The touch screen became jumpy and unresponsive. Piece of junk I've wasted too much time on. A shame because I really liked it at first. My dealings with ASUS resulted in a complete loss of confidence with the company. Although some of their products have good reviews (even this one, amazingly), I now avoid ASUS products completely because I'm not willing to roll the dice with them again. If ASUS had acknowledged the problem, fixed defective units, and released a revision, it would have cost them a trivial amount of money. It would have been the right thing to do. Instead, they are writing off customers as a less expensive loss."

In my experience, avoid the ASUS-built Nexus products. They're not well-built and the low quality can't make up for the price. If you hold a Nexus 5 or 6, and then feel the Nexus 7, you can sense just by touch where the money has gone.

When something does go wrong, it's a nightmare. For instance, this product decided to stop booting after a software update, getting stuck on the Google screen. After a fair amount of troubleshooting on my own, I contacted Google, who sent me to ASUS. ASUS told me they'd fix it... for $150 if it's a motherboard problem, and some unspecified amount if it's a software problem.

Did I mention there's no way to hard reboot/factory reset the device if you can't get into the OS?

So, yeah... I'll try sideloading the operating system, and if that doesn't work, Samsung it is for my next tablet. Google needs a better manufacturing partner to keep its brand from being tarnished."

B00DVFLJKQ,237,2369,"Nice all round tablet-unimpressive ambient light sensor, no global LTE option",Nick,4,-,27-Jul-14,2,0,"The Nexus 7 (Kit Kat) is a well rounded device that does most things well, a jack of all trades and master of none. I primarily purchased this device for app development and reading PDF files while traveling.

The fit and finish are good and I prefer the grippy plastic back to the metal back of the iPad mini. Aesthetically it is a nice device. The only minor issue I have is with finding the power button by feel and it seems that the sound rocker works the opposite to what I expect. No real issues here. As far as operating systems go I personally prefer Kit Kat to iOS at the moment, but it is a personal choice. Android also has a good range of apps.

The automatic brightness setting/ambient light sensor is really annoying. It starts out fine, but within a second or so of use it dims or brightens. It is getting more noticeable the longer I have the tablet. This is just not nice and distracts from what is otherwise a capable device. I find myself constantly having to adjust the brightness setting manually. Not good. I've never had this problem on an iPad. I sincerely hope this is a software problem that can be fixed and not a hardware problem, but I suspect ASUS went cheap on the light sensor. At the moment I'm leaning towards a software problem as there is no light variation when I turn off automatic light settings. The sensor also seems to work correctly when presented with light and dark scenarios.

Initially I was very disappointed with the Nexus 7 as a PDF reader and I kept wanting to grab an iPad mini retina because the form factor seemed to be better for this purpose. However, I discovered that acrobat has a text reflow mode that formats PDFs more like e-books. It works on a limited number of PDFs but helps. The Nexus 7 is easier to palm with one hand in portrait than the retina iPad mini, which makes it a good e-reader. Reflection is a problem so if this is your primary use then it may be better to get a purpose built e-reader.

What is up with LTE? I wanted to purchase an LTE device for use domestically and internationally, but there are two versions one for the US and another for everywhere else. Come on Google and Asus, Apple has a device that is capable of supporting both domestic and international LTE. For business use this is important to me. I want one device I can stick various data sims in without needing multiple devices.

Overall this is a good device, which is let down by the ambient light sensor and lack of genuine LTE support."

B00DVFLJKQ,238,2372,"Affordable, good features, but ultimately suffers from many hardware and quality control issues.",Andy Pants,2,-,19-Nov-14,1,0,"I purchased the Nexus 7 shortly after its launch in summer of 2013. I have already submitted the tablet once to ASUS for an RMA. While I like this tablet for what it is, myself and many other users have been plagued with a lot of issues that point to poor hardware quality and quality control. When the tablet isn't experiencing any problems, it's a great tablet.

The Good:
- The IPS LED screen is nice. Good color, brightness, and viewing angles. The pixel density and resolution is great.
- Lightweight plastic body, which cuts down on weight, making it less fatiguing to hold in your hands for long periods of time.
- Qi charging compatible is neat.
- Decent performance. As of this review, I have stock Android 5.0 running on the N7, and it's pretty smooth.
- Attractive price, but you do get what you pay for...

The Bad:
- Weird, unnecessarily wide top and bottom bezel. Considering there are no front-facing speakers nor capacitive buttons, this is a strange design choice that is a poor use of space.
- Speakers, while stereo, are not great. Not surprising for a mobile device. But you would think that a tablet, with its larger space, would have speakers that perform considerably better than those on a mobile phone. The HTC One, while smaller, has comparable, if not better, speaker sound.
- Cameras are so-so, but tablets never have decent cameras anyway. They'll do the job, just not very well.

- Touchscreen issues. My first N7 would simply not register any touches at random intervals. Even after receiving after my RMA, the touchscreen still has stints of unresponsiveness or erratic responses. This is most noticeable when playing games that simulate the use of analog sticks on-screen.
- Backlight bleeding. YMMV with how much backlight bleeding you may get. Some units have it bad, some not so much. My first N7 had bleeding near the top edge. The unit I received after the RMA has very little.
- Poor microUSB connection. Another reason I had to submit my N7 for an RMA. It would only be detected by my computer if I plugged it in just right, then it stopped being detected completely.
- Random stuttering and freezing. My first N7 had this bad. Sometimes it was solved or at least improved with a custom kernel, but it was always there. The unit I received after the RMA hasn't frozen enough for me to notice, leading me to believe that it was a hardware issue before that has since been solved.

To be fair, many of the problems I experienced have been solved since receiving a new unit after an RMA. However, the fact that many users, myself included, have had to go through RMAs to get a problem-free tablet is troubling, and points to poor quality control. Without these issues, the N7 2013 is a great 7"" tablet. Just make sure you check yours for any of the above issues, and be prepared to exchange it or put in an RMA."
B00DVFLJKQ,238,2373,Best tablet yet!,Amazon Customer,5,-,22-May-14,2,0,"I spent some time going through all of the tablets online and trying to find one that met my needs. I was attracted to the Nexus 7 by the size of the internal memory and the screen resolution. I am totally pleased with my choice.

This is the third tablet I have owned and totally outshines the other two. It is simply a mini-computer, allowing me to print and create my own docs. Best of all I was able to get a Bluetooth keyboard and a Bluetooth mouse and they work well together. I already have dozens of apps on the tablet and still have 21GB left. My last tablet had 8GB and was filled before I had much on it.

Can't say enough about the screen. The HD quality is incredible. It's easy to read the small letters, even with my elderly eyes. I'm looking forward to downloading movies to watch.

The speed is quicker than I could have hoped for and the Google version of ""Siri"" works better than the original. There have been very few times when it didn't figure out what I was asking.

I would absolutely recommend the 2013 Nexus 7 to anyone looking to buy a tablet. I was able to get mine through Walmart for a ridiculously low price and added the keyboard and mouse to create a complete ""system"" for less than $50. The HP 4000b mouse works very well."
B00DVFLJKQ,238,2374,It fits nicely in my purse and just makes life so much ...,J Creech,5,-,10-Nov-14,2,0,"I read a LOT of reviews over the course of a few months before settling on which tablet to buy. I finally broke down and decided to go with the Nexus 7, even though it did cost a little more than I'd planned to spend. I have had the tablet for awhile now and have zero regrets. It does everything I need and more. I've almost completely stopped using my nook Simple since getting the Nexus. I originally thought I'd just use it for reading in bed at night. It didn't take long for that to expand to a trip to the in-laws and then the doctor's office and next thing I know it is going everywhere with me! It fits nicely in my purse and just makes life so much easier when it comes to reading or playing games on the go. I'm glad I let the Hubby talk me into getting the larger amount of memory. Since this tablet doesn't have a USB slot for storing things to a memory card, it is pretty essential to consider that when selecting which tablet to purchase. I also love that I didn't have to buy any new cords for charging! It takes the same as my phone, and a few other devices we own. I just can't say enough good things about this little tablet. Thanks to all the previous owners for your excellent reviews and recommendations!"
B00DVFLJKQ,238,2375,"The 2013 addition is well worth the upgrade. Best 7"" tablet around",Richard Baker,5,-,21-Jun-14,1,0,"The Good: Sleek and light, gorgeous high-res screen, fantastic 5.1 surround sound speakers, ultra fast and zippy, addition is rear camera is nice

The Bad: Cameras are a bit lacking, no expandable media option

The Nexus 7 was the best 7 inch tablet on the market at its time. With the powerful Tegra 3 chipset it seemed like it was unstoppable…that is until its cousin came along to trump it. Not only is the 2013 addition thinner and sleeker, it’s 4 times as powerful and is well worth upgrading. Google partnered with Asus once again but this time ditched the Tegra chipset and threw in the Snapdragon CPU and Adreno GPU. Once you open the box you will immediately notice the physical changes to the tablet. The deep black and the overall more rectangle shape and sharper edges look slick and clean. Gone is the soft bumpy back from before replaced with plastic and a beveled Nexus logo. I do miss that soft back as it didn’t scratch, but the new back still has a soft fuzzy feeling to it.

Apart from that you will also notice the front facing camera has moved to the right as there is now a back camera that is 5.0 MP. The front camera has improved slightly by 0.1 MP but it makes a difference. While other tablets have more powerful rear facing cameras the Nexus 7 does record in 1080p and looks pretty good in well-lit areas. I would have liked to see at least an 8 MP camera, but just having a camera added is a great addition. There isn’t a flash so the camera is nearly useless at night.

Let’s talk about the screen. It’s absolutely gorgeous. The 1920×1200 resolution LCD screen looks clear, bright, and crisp. The resolution upgrade is very noticeable compared to the 2012 model. With 323 ppi everything is going to pop out at you from games to comics. The sound is also something I love in this tablet that most tablets don’t have. We have 5.1 surround sound in this thing. Two small speakers at the bottom and a large one at the top. The speakers are made by Fraunhofer who are the guys who invented the MP3. I immediately noticed the sound difference when I started playing games. It sounds like everything is coming at your from all angles, it’s rich, crisp, and so much clearer than the 2012 model.

So what’s under the hood? The speed increase is incredible as apps load faster and things just process at a much faster rate. My comics rendered faster, games loaded quicker, and I had zero hang when loading graphic heavy websites in Chrome or switching apps quickly. The Snapdragon Krait 300 CPU is clocked at 1.51 Ghz and is quad-core. This is much faster than the 2012?s 1.3 Ghz CPU. The Adreno 320 GPU helps a lot as well and is loads faster than the Tegra 3. Games looked better and everything loaded so much faster. For example, on the 2012 model I could not select the best graphics option in Rival Knights, on the 2013 model I could. I also had a lot of slow down with low framerate on the 2012 model in Joe Dever’s Lone Wolf. On the 2013 model it ran at 60 FPS.

The battery also lasts a good while for a slimmer battery. You will get hours of gaming or reading out of this thing even with Wifi on. Besides processing speed the 2013 model has Bluetooth 4.0, screen mirroring, Qi wireless battery charging, a notification indicator at the bottom of the tablet. These may not seem like much but they make a big difference for an upgrade. Not to mention the loose charging port from the previous model has been fixed with a more sturdy USB slot. The tablet is also 2 ounces lighter so you can’t really complain.

Bottom line: The Google Nexus 7 (2013) is the best 7 inch tablet you can get your hands on at a great price. If you own the 2012 model I highly recommend the upgrade like I did. It’s fast, sleek, has a gorgeous screen, and has fantastic surround sound speakers."
B00DVFLJKQ,238,2376,I've owned a few tablets...,Jeffrey W. A.,5,-,10-Jan-14,2,2,"And I have to say I am quite pleased with the Nexus 7 (2013). I am somewhat of a gadget geek, iPods, iPads, Windows Phones, Android Phones, laptops, build my own computers, etc. Do I consider myself an expert, no, but I do consider myself an above average user.

That being said I have been very happy with the Nexus 7 in terms of size, battery life, features and functionality. I use it primarily for surfing the web and playing games with a little bit of work related tasks here and there. Since I already have a Galaxy Note 3 and use Google related products to manage my life, the nexus fits in quite well, giving me another touch point to manage my calendar, tasks, email, etc.

The size is the biggest pro...large enough to make reading emails, books and other documents easy on the eyes, but still small enough to throw into a pocket without creating the burden on something else to carry. For example I am volunteer firefighter and used to take my iPad with me to monthly meetings. Unfortunately I dropped it from the truck once when carrying all my gear to the truck (didn't break or anything, but it could have). The nexus easily fits in my jacket pocket.

Also, being a Google product its sure to get updates quickly...I was able to upgrade to KitKat in December, well before a lot of other devices on the Market.

The only negative I can come with as I think about it is the screen brightness, but I'll need to check the setting when I get home."
B00DVFLJKQ,238,2377,"Nexus 7, Second Gen",Betty,5,-,23-Apr-14,1,0,"This tablet was bought to replace my old Amazon Kindle Fire HD that suddenly died. I've been wanting to switch to a Google tablet for a while now since Google Play offers more of a variety when it comes to apps, unlike the Kindle. So far, I'm highly impressed by the Nexus 7.

Some things I like:

01. The size and weight of the tablet. I have small hands and while I could hold the Kindle in one hand, it couldn't for long before my fingers started to cramp. However, I can hold the Nexus easily in one hand, which makes it easy to read on.

02. The keyboard. I've found it's easier to type on than the Kindle and iPad (I use an iPad at work sometimes) keyboards are. Also, it has a built-in emoji keyboard, which is nice since most of my friends use Apple products and now I can see what they're posting to Twitter when they use emojis.

03. Battery life. The battery is superb. I was able to play a game on the tablet for an hour straight without the battery dying on me like with other tablets I've used.

04. KitKat. The description of this tablet says it has JellyBean, but the tablet does update the software to KitKat.

05. Display. It's crisp and clear. I used the HBOGo app to watch Game of Thrones and was highly impressed by the picture quality. It also makes reading books/emails/news articles a lot easier, especially for someone who doesn't have the best eyesight to begin with (like me!).

06. Quickness. The tablet is fast.

07. Sound. The sound quality is really, really good, especially with earbuds.

The only thing I don't like about this tablet is how the power button and volumes are positioned on the side of the tablet. I find myself fumbling to find the right one to press."
B00DVFLJKQ,238,2378,Extremely Fine Purchase!,Carla,5,-,11-Oct-14,1,0,"This is my first tablet and I am astonished just how beautifully the 2013 Nexus 7 Tablet performs!

Photos, movies & TV shows are absolutely GORGEOUS! I purchased a $12 cover that folds backwards into a stand which makes the tablet extremely convenient because it can be propped up in my lap, on a table or even against a pillow when I'm using it. Also, an angled cable for charging was a MUST for me since I use the tablet for very long periods of time and I tend to bump the cord when it's charging. I am about to purchase a wireless keyboard because I like a ""real"" keyboard when using Google Drive for documents, as well as an External Hard Drive for more memory so that I can throw my $600 Dell Inspiron Laptop in the trash where it has belonged since the 5th day out of the ""Dell 12-month warranty"".

Suddenly (after not using the tablet for about 6 weeks), the colored X logo showed up on the screen and would not disappear. I tried doing the Factory Reset (instructions: [...] and Option 2 here: [...] . This did not work. Per comments in the first and other links, many other people have had the same problem. I just called ASUS Tech Support (888-678-3688). They said I would need to send the device to ASUS, and since it is out of warranty, I would have to pay for the repair. The repair estimate I was given was $201.25---i.e., more than the price I paid for a new tablet!!!! What a Rip-Off! Heed the negative reviews!"
B00DVFLJKQ,238,2380,"Great screen and form-factor, but freezes/crashes pretty often.",Brazilian Jazzaholic!,3,-,14-Oct-13,1,0,"While I basically use my iPad as a mini-laptop, I needed a smaller device that could be held in one hand for reading e-books and web-surfing. Plus, I needed a tablet (unlike the iPad) that I could load Adobe Flash Player onto for playing online Flash video and using Flash-based websites. (Adobe Flash is no longer ""officially"" supported on Android tablets, but the application can easily be downloaded from several developer websites and still runs well on the new Nexus 7). I spent quite awhile researching and trying to decide between the Nexus 7 and the Samsung Tab 3 (8-inch), but I ended up choosing this device because I wanted a ""pure Android"" OS, and the Nexus seemed like it would be easier to hold in one hand, being a slightly smaller/narrower device.

In terms of pure esthetics, the Nexus 7 is a gorgeous tablet. It's slim, sleek and shiny (on the front; the back is made of a grippier material that keeps it from slipping out of your hand). The screen is a thing of beauty: Colors are bright and crisp, and video and photos ""pop"" off the screen. The high resolution display is ideally suited to playing HD video. There are also a plethora of apps from the Google Play store that make this a very handy little device.

However, the benchmark of a real quality computer -- be it a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone -- is that it should function smoothly and seamlessly, with a minimum of glitches. Unfortunately, this is where the Nexus 7 falls short. I've had this device for about a month now, and at least 3-4 times per week, it freezes and/or crashes. Apps will suddenly stop working and close, or the touch screen will become unresponsive, requiring me to shut down the device and restart it. Also, the Google touchscreen keyboard is buggy and often slow to respond to taps, especially when entering text in web browser apps like Chrome and Firefox.

The above glitches don't happen enough for me to declare my Nexus 7 a total ""lemon,"" but they are pretty annoying when they happen. And they happen too frequently for me to give the Nexus 7 a wholehearted recommendation. Hence my 3 star rating.

Finally, the lack of a microSD card slot is a significant omission on the Nexus 7. Apps are pretty memory-intensive on their own, and if you're planning on storing your music collection or HD movies/TV shows on your Nexus, even 32gb of onboard memory can get eaten up pretty quickly. It would've been great if the Nexus 7 had included a microSD slot for expanding the device's memory. That said, thanks to a nifty 3rd party device called the Meenova Mini Micro SD Card Reader (please Google it), it is possible to expand the file storage capacity of the Nexus 7. The Meenova looks like a tiny thumb drive, except that it holds a microSD card of up to 32gb, and it plugs into the microUSB port on the Nexus. Ideally, the Nexus 7 would have an internal microSD card slot, but in the absence of that, the Meenova is a good work-around.

Grade: C"
B00DVFLJKQ,239,2381,The Best Tablet of 2013 (And 2014),Eduardo,5,-,17-Aug-14,-,0,"Google’s Nexus line of products has been full of great and excellent products. The Nexus 7 is no exception. With excellent power, long battery life, and its gorgeous screen, the Nexus 7 is the best tablet to get if you are looking for the perfect 7-inch tablet at a good price.

-Design-

Admittedly, the design is not the most beautiful. It probably won’t impress next to the likes of the iPad Air and even other Android devices such as those from Samsung. But while the design may be understated, it is not as ugly or as barren as an ancient barn. The plastic back is covered in soft material that feels like rubber, with good grip and a resistance to fingerprints. The nexus logo is placed with shiny plastic all along the middle. Even the box it came in organized and beautifully packaged. As for the front, there is nothing to be excited about, but its simplicity is still very much attractive. It is built solidly and there is no flex, twisting, or any cheap feeling material that would be normally found on low end Android devices. If I were to say what the weakest link of the device was, it would be the buttons on the side. They are a bit loose (at least with mine) and they aren’t as sturdy as I’d like them to be, but it still works great, even after 7 months of constant use and abuse.

-Software-

If you have a Samsung or an HTC phone, then the layout will be different, albeit not that much. It comes with Android 4.4 KitKat, which is the most recent Android version available. It works similarly to other Android phones. Google Play Store is where you will get all of your apps and updates and all apps will be available to you. Apps run and will mostly be compatible with the device (Only apps exclusively available for phones won’t run on it). It has software buttons instead of physical home buttons, which work perfectly well and it is completely customizable if you are the type of person who likes that. If you prefer the simplicity of iOS products, it can work that way too.

-Performance-

The Nexus 7 uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro Quad-Core Processor running at 1.5 GHz with an Adreno 320 GPU. It also has a 1920 x 1200 screen, which is Retina quality screen. Its 323 ppi means that the screen looks beautiful. Text are paper clear and movies can be shown in full HD and with rich colors. The processor is not the fastest processor currently available, but it is powerful that you won’t notice. Website is fully responsive with no lag whatsoever. Apps run smoothly and with no stutter ever. Games like Dead Trigger 2 and Asphalt 8 run smooth as silk and movies download swiftly and smoothly. The only time it will lag a bit is when there are a lot of apps open. But even then, the lag is barely noticeable. It can run everything flawlessly. Only drawback is that the storage space may not be enough for those who want everything on their tablet since it only comes with 32GB of internal storage, which is really only about 25GB of actual available storage. But for most people, this is more than enough. Battery life is also excellent, I go throughout 3 days when just browsing and reading without any intense things going on. Battery life should be impressive even under pressure.

-Quality-

I’ve owned this tablet for 8 months now and it has dropped a couple of times. Out of these times, the corners cracked and the black frame around the screen has come apart. But the screen cracked after too many drops, even with a case on it. Warrenty covered the damage, so that was good. But if you are really careful or get a tough case for it, then the Nexus 7 should have no problem in the reliability department.

-Perks-

This being a Google product, it is supported by them with the latest updates available as soon as they are released. Those who have any other manufacturer's devices usually lag a bit from getting a new software update. Some may wait from anywhere from a month to even a year or in some cases never. The new Android 5.0 promises improvements and new features and having a Nexus device makes you the first one to use the new updates. Being made by Google also means it supports almost all applications without fail. It is also currently the best balance between price and performance.

-Competition-

Currently, there are a few options but there are reasons not to take them. An iPad Mini (Non Retina) is $299 and is currently the cheapest way of getting into the Apple ecosystem. It is a good tablet in its own right, but it is $30 more and comes with less space (16GB vs 32GB). A 32GB option is not available for the normal iPad Mini, so the price would be $499 for the equivalent 32GB Nexus 7 ($269.99) A Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is tempting, but too slow and not worth the $20 saved. The LG G Pad 10.1 is good for those who want a bigger screen and same responsiveness, but the screen is too blurry. The REAL contender is the NVIDIA Shield Tablet. At $299, it is a bit more expensive and comes with less storage. However, the screen is bigger and it personally looks better to me. However, the real feature that threatens the Nexus 7 is the processor. Its called the Tegra K1, which is an EXTREMELY powerful chip that has a huge performance gap over the Nexus 7. And although it will update later than the Nexus 7, NVIDIA has had a reputation of updating quick, so it shouldn’t be a problem. These two are good solid choices.

-Conclusion-
The Nexus 7 isn’t perfect. It could’ve been more attractive and it could’ve been built to stand out more. But for the price, the performance, and the support, the Nexus 7 is the best, if not the perfect tablet on the market."

Unfortunately, I wound up with one of the units (apparently there are quite few) which kept freezing and rebooting while in use. I sent it in to ASUS for repair, and it came back with the same problem, plus a chipped corner of the screen! I sent it in yet again, figuring they'd be shamed into really getting on it this time - that was a month ago. When I call them, no one can say what is going on, or when I may expect to see it again.

I plan to buy something else, and it won't be from ASUS. With all the appealing choices there are in the marketplace, a product with negligent and indifferent manufacturer support is not worth having unless you don't mind just tossing it in the event that it fails.

I bought my Nexus 7 last August when it first came out, mainly for reading digital comics and fiction. I LOVED IT. I used it every day. I didnt have any complaints. UNTIL the jellybean update came out and killed it. My tablet got stuck in a boot loop, or would just crash constantly. If I was lucky I got 15 minutes of use out of it before it would crash. Sometimes it wouldn't charge. Whatever the problem, it was pretty much unusable. This was early December 2013. Its now June 2014, and its mainly just an expensive paper weight. I would have returned it, but the boyfriend found it necessary to unlock the thing and void my warranty.

I wavered a lot before purchasing this device because I wasnt sure I could trust the software. Sadly my fears were proven correct. Say what you will about Apple devices being overpriced and behind on features, at least you can depend on them to operate for as long as you want to keep the device.

I would buy another one immediately if I could trust that I could at least get 2 years of use out of it, but I don't."

2) Sometimes the battery totally discharges at night while it is asleep
3) Connectors wobble in the charging port and often don't get an electrical connection at all
4) Touch sensitivity is erratic. Sometimes have to tap something several times. Drag and drop is nearly impossible as it randomly drops the icon mid-drag. Also suffers from occasional ghost touches.

B00DVFLJKQ,239,2388,Best Android Tablet to date but has issues,Ezareth,3,Yes,31-Jul-13,905,51,"***(Updated 8-30-2013)

I have both the Original Nexus 7 and Second Generation Nexus 7 and I've been using the new Nexus 7 constantly for over 3 weeks now.

ISSUES:
***GPS - Issue resolved with Android Build Number JSS15Q
There was an issue with all Nexus 7 FHD Tablets where the GPS location would freeze and the only way to get it working again was to reboot the tablet.

Wifi - In my home the new Nexus has issues finding and connecting to my home network and it drops occasionally despite not having this issue with my old Nexus 7 (running 4.1), TV, PS3 and other devices on my WiFi in the area.
***This is a confirmed issue with Android 4.3, not the Nexus 7 FHD. I've experienced the same issue on my old Nexus 7 once I updated it to 4.3 and it has never had a Wifi issue before now.

Initial Reboot Issue - The first night using the new tablet I was playing a game when it just instantly powered off mid-game. When I booted it back up I got a ""Enter password to decrypt Storage message"" despite never decrypting or setting a password on anything. There was no way to get past this screen short of restoring the entire tablet back to factory condition which was relatively simple but I lost everything I had on my tablet at that point.
*** I still get a random reboot in the middle of using my tablet every couple of weeks but haven't had to rebuild it yet

OBSERVATIONS:

*** Battery - One key difference I'd like to point out as a major advantage over the old Tablet isn't as much the battery life which lasts slightly longer than the old Nexus 7, but the fact you can use the tablet while it is plugged into the charger and it will slowly CHARGE, while the old Tablet would slowly DRAIN. This is important for power users and people who will be using it for long periods to watch movies/Netflix etc.

Look and feel - I love the way the new Nexus feels in your hand compared to the old one. The difference in the width makes holding the new nexus in your hand much more comfortable. It is slightly longer however and I wish they had taken the opportunity to shorten it as well.

Screen - Everyone has been saying how noticeably better the screen is but honestly despite having a much higher resolution and pixel density I haven't been able to see a marked difference although the new screen is definitely brighter. I've played Netflix side by side with the old one on the same show and they look identical in every way. I've tested dozens of websites side by side now and there is no discernible difference between the screens when viewing web content. I haven't had a chance to try out any non-streaming movies yet but I think for every day usage you're not going to notice a difference when comparing it to the old Nexus 7. This isn't because the new screen is bad, only that the old Nexus 7 has an excellent screen and there are rapidly diminishing degrees of noticeability beyond that point.

Camera - The new camera for a 5MP camera actually takes pretty fair shots and I'm glad they included it. They actually look better than the photos taken with the 5MP camera on my Galaxy Nexus and the new Nexus 7 is much better at taking low light shots.

Speakers - In my Netflix test I could detect slightly better sound on the new Nexus in stereo but it was barely noticeable to me. The difference between the two is hardly worth mentioning and neither one is going to give you any sort of quality sound.

Performance - This is where the new Nexus is noticeably faster and the UI feels more responsive. I tested out several games that would be choppy on my old Nexus at times and experienced none of that on the new Nexus. One thing I haven't seen people note however is that although the new GPU is approximately 4 times faster, the resolution on the new Nexus has 2.3 times the pixels so your true performance increase from a hardware perspective graphically is going to be less than double, similar to the CPU performance increase. There has never been a time where I experienced any latency, stuttering or hesitance on the New Nexus 7, it operates flawlessly in this regard

Operating System - 4.3 Android was just pushed to my old Nexus 7 last night. This includes TRIM support which is one of the reasons many people experienced a slow down with time on their old Nexus (which I never have experienced since I wasn't a heavy installer/uninstaller). The update also includes Open GLES 3.0 so it is possible that games will run smoother on the old Nexus as well. Nothing really to contrast here now.

HDMI Out (With Slimport Adapter) - I picked up a new Slimport adapater and the HDMI out functionality works flawlessly, but when you plug in your AC charger into it, the Nexus 7 only registers it as ""USB"" charging which still slowly drains the battery. I tested it using Netflix against my Playstation 3 on my Samsung 52"" 1080P TV running the same show and the two looked and sounded identical with the exception of the Nexus 7 having a slightly clipped black border around the edges of the Television. I tested it for an hour with the charger plugged in and lost 8% Battery so as long as you start using it with a full battery you shouldn't run into issues there.

PROs:
Better form factor and higher quality ""feel""
Noticable Performance Improvements
HDMI Out (With Slimport adapter)
Improved Battery Life and more efficient power useage
5 MP Front facing Camera
Brighter screen with a higher pixel density

CONs:
Wifi Issues
Occasional Reboots
More Expensive than old Nexus 7

SUMMARY: If you currently own a Nexus 7 I would say the extra expense isn't worth the marginal upgrades unless you need something the new one in particular offers(HDMI Out/Front Facing Camera). In my case I'm giving my old Nexus 7 to my wife so my upgrade serves a dual purpose. If you don't currently own an android tablet or want a small form factor tablet then this tablet is the best money can buy."
B00DVFLJKQ,239,2389,The Downsized Upgrade,Kindle Customer,5,-,02-Aug-13,12,0,"Aside from a brief and craptacular experience with the Motorola Xoom a couple years ago, I've been an iOS user.. multiple generations of iPhones, iPad 2, and iPad 3. Generally happy with the ecosystem, apps, and user experience, but I've been itching for a smaller form factor for a while and didn't like the idea of chipping in on the iPad Mini - it read like a reactive, rushed, sub-par product. Around the time I started reading up on the first-gen Nexus 7, there were rumblings of the 2nd gen, so the clock started ticking on dipping a toe back into the Android pond.

My preordered Nexus 7 FHD 32GB arrived a couple days ago, and I can't find a thing I don't like about it.

Speed. There's an agility in its performance that's reminiscent of the iPad 3 - but more impressive. It's a fast machine. Apps snap into action. Nothing I've thrown at it so far makes it lag.

Resolution. Other reviews extoll the pixel mathematics; from my perspective, it's stunning. Better than anything I've seen in a tablet. Netflix streaming movies are crisp, photos are brilliantly rendered, and the overall onscreen environment is exceptionally pleasing to the eyes. If screen resolutions on tablets never evolved any further, this would be a great stopping point. Just beautiful.

Form factor. For me, the 7"" tablet is the sweet spot. Sure, I like watching movies or reading on a 10"" tablet, but there's no fidelity or experience loss in this size. It's nice to hold, and doesn't feel cheap or flimsy in the slightest.

OS. My glimpse into the Android ecosystem during the early-adopter days of the Motorola Xoom wasn't favorable. Herky-jerky performance, weird onscreen typing lag, lack of tablet apps - it wasn't a meaningful experience. The difference between then and now is nothing short of astonishing. There's a level of polish and detail that speaks to an average iOS user like me, yet contains all the paths into the 'under the hood' aspects of Android that illuminate the nerd appeal. I love the fact that there's so much to learn and do with this OS, unlike iOS where you're largely just along for the ride.

Price: Doesn't really need further championing. You get an amazing product with all the bells and whistles for an exceptionally reasonable price. It seems like every Apple device I buy immediately goes into a cushioned case, gets a screen protector, and I transport the thing like it's an donated organ. After such a significant buy-in for an iPad, who wants to deal with a shattered or scratched-up screen or dented chassis? The lower price point on the Nexus 7 doesn't mean I'll baby the Nexus 7 any less, but I don't feel the same compulsion to make it live like Bubble Boy, and I can just use the device in an everyday sense. Replacing a damaged N7 won't be as financially painful as an iPad.

One tip: the first couple times I plugged in (Apple) headphones, I was getting crackly sound, or no sound at all. The headphone jack didn't feel look it was inserting all the way (but felt like it was going as far as it could), and I wondered if I had a bum unit. Turns out, you have to push it in a bit harder than you'd initially like to, which will result in a satisfying snap and boom - full audio. Felt a little silly afterwards, but hopefully that helps others with the same question/issue.

Gen 1 Nexus 7 users and Android fans in general don't need to be convinced - they ought to be largely happy with the upgrades present in this iteration. But for iOS users like me looking for the same kind of 'change', this is it. Check it out at a retailer, hold it, swipe it, play with it. You'll 'get it', and then you'll get it."
B00DVFLJKQ,239,2390,Never again!,Amazon Customer,1,-,15-Mar-15,4,1,I have had this tablet now for a little over a year and already it is bogged down to the point where it is almost totally useless. It stalls and hangs so badly that one simply wants to throw it in the river. I would give it 10 stars if I could. I have tried every online solution that I can find to fix it and nothing has worked. huge price to pay for something that only works for a little over a year. I would give it 0 stars if I could. I don't often give reviews of products but this warranted me speaking out. I will never buy another Nexus tablet.
B00DVFLJKQ,240,2391,Worthy upgrade from the first generation. Lighter. Beautiful sharp screen. Smooth performance. I LOVE it even more.,Kiyo M.,5,-,05-Feb-14,-,0,"If you're trying to decide whether to save more money on the first generation or this new one, it is a no brainer:

GO FOR THE NEW ONE.

After getting my hands on the new one, I can confidently say that.

I know new is not always better and companies put out new models that necessarily is not worth the cost upgrade, but in this case, there is so much more significant improvements, it really is a no brainer upgrade.

I own the first generation of Nexus 7 (released in 2012) and have been happy with it; besides the performance of it on certain apps and occasions, I really didn't see a need to upgrade. I use it every day (and I also have a Nexus 10; Kindle Fire; and my family owns an iPad); I found a great deal on the new Nexus 7, so I decided to finally go for it.

The improvements are easily worth the price. Even if the price difference is a hundred dollars, the screen alone is seriously worth the upgrade. It really is NIGHT AND DAY.

When I'm watching an HD video with the new Nexus 7, it doesn't feel like I'm looking at a screen. There is so much more detail, it looks like you're actually there, and the contrast is EASILY better that the colors really pop.

Holding it in the hands feels so much better too. The weight is very noticeable and thinner. Everything about it just cleaner - it really makes the old feel fat and heavy, as thin and light as it was.

Pros vs first generation:
- Fantastic sharp screen - More detail and colors really pop! (1920x1200 323ppi vs 1280x800 216ppi)
- Feels much better in the hands - lighter - much more pleasant experience
- Faster processor and runs much smoother
- Speakers really do sound better
- Backside camera

What would make the Nexus tablets even better is if it had a SD or microSD slot; but you can get a micro USB host cable and the Nexus Media Importer App.

Personally, I would go for the 32GB because the 16GB really is easily going to limit you in the long run with the installed apps and such.

Again, I own the Nexus 10 and first generation Nexus 7, but I'm still VERY impressed by the 2nd generation Nexus 7. I love it and I would not hesitate at all and can confidently recommend the new one over the first one. Technology really amazes me.

This is definitely a must-have for any tech gadget lover."
B00DVFLJKQ,240,2392,Simple attractive form factor and great speed with a feasible price,James,5,-,13-Jun-14,-,0,"I received this tablet as a gift. It has a beautiful screen with ample power under the hood for a very reasonable price. It has been reported buy some early in its release ( summer 2013) that some devices were plagued with minor touch screen issues and random reboots. I have not experienced any of these issues. There have been several updates to the software of the device since its release. (Prompt updates are are expected with a nexus device).

The screen is excellent. Videos and games look great on this device, however the sound is rather average and isn't very loud. It has duel speakers on the back instead of the front which would be better, but most devices have the speakers in the back which makes it average not terrible. The over all build is simple and minimalistic but feels premium. The back has a grippy soft touch feel to it with a matte finish that is not slippery, and doesn't show fingerprints. It feels great in the hand, Its very light and thin.

It has a quad core snapdragon sp400 1.5 GHz processor and 2 gigs of ram. It runs very smooth and with these specs should perform quite well for sometime. The specs are ever better than some more expensive 2014 Samsung tablets in this size category.

Overall, very reasonable price, looks and feels great, and handles even better. Speakers are average. Great software support and on time updates from Google."
B00DVFLJKQ,240,2393,Great Tablet!!,Amazon Customer,5,-,16-Apr-14,2,0,"There are so many great things about this tablet I don't know where to start. The build quality is excellent -- very satisfying fit and finish. The display is bright and razor sharp. (Just as an e-reader it rivals anything else on the market.) The form factor is a little unusual but very well thought out, and I love that I can just stick it in my back pocket. The audio out from the built-in stereo speakers is clear and surprisingly rich (but of course you'll want to use headphones to get the best sound when you're playing your MP3s). The audio input works great with Skype and video recording, and supports very accurate speech recognition. The cameras take great stills and videos and the built-in photo/video apps are chock full of nice features. Android KitKat 4.4 is rock solid on this device -- I've been using it all day every day for a month and it hasn't had any kind of a glitch ever. I get more than a day off a full charge. The four core ARMv7 CPU is very responsive -- I never feel like I have to wait for it. The charger port also supports full two-way USB I/O functionality. Last but not least, the price point is better than anything else out there. If you're in the market for a tablet in this general size, don't look any further, this one is a real standout!!"
B00DVFLJKQ,240,2394,Most perfect tablet ever for my 7- and 9-year-old boys,Claire O'Neal,5,-,15-Feb-14,-,0,"They each got one for Christmas 2013, but before they did, there was MUCH discussion. Should they get an iPad mini? Should they get a Kindle? What about the older version of this tablet, or one with less memory, both of which could be had at SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper prices?

After putting this model in the boys' hands during a test run at Best Buy, we were sold, and here's why:
1) My boys use it to: play cheap-o apps from the app store, watch Netflix, surf the net to answer their own questions and research projects for school, chat and email with their friends, and video chat and email their grandparents.
2) It's way cheaper than a similarly-equipped iPad mini.
3) The aspect ratio is absolutely perfect for gaming and watching cartoons on Netflix.
4) It is light as a feather, which makes it SUPER SUPER fun to play with.
5) My husband was insistent that we buy the new Nexus model with Snapdragon. His research suggested the boys' gaming experience would be the better for it.

There have been hangups. For one, my iPhone family had to get used to Google Play. And Google Hangouts, too, which sucks, but it works. Also, we committed to accessory purchases that I would absolutely recommend to anyone buying this for a child:
1) The BobJ cover, in their favorite color. (http://www.amazon.com/Bobj-Rugged-Nexus-Model-Tablet/dp/B00EMZC11K)
2) Buying Funamo software for each device, at $19.99 a piece for a lifetime subscription (I do not work for Funamo in any way, just speaking from experience). This software has so far provided us with flexible, excellent, and absolutely essential parental controls/child protection on their device. The Nexus DOES NOT come equipped with any protection whatsoever to stop your 7-year-old from accidentally navigating to pornographic pictures while trying to bravely and independently google for answers about why he wets the bed AND I AM SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE HERE. Funamo so far has provided us absolutely flawless internet-surfing protection. For example, you can go to their Funamo Browser (AKA Chrome through a parental shield), type ""porn"" in the search engine, and it comes up with no results. Funamo also allows you to restrict which apps the device can access and when, and to set time limits, like that the kiddos are only allowed to use their devices for 2 hours a day.

I really can't express how phenomenally awesome these devices have been in our lives. With what limited time they are allowed to play on them, I have been so impressed at how the boys choose to use. They beg me to schedule minecraft parties with their friends, where they all sit on the couch snuggled up and build things together in a shared virtual world. They come up to me during their Nexus time and I see that they have been using Google Earth to chart a potential exploring adventure, or how to build a skateboard from scratch (which they actually did, with help from my husband). Win win WIN."
B00DVFLJKQ,240,2395,Nexus 7 First Impressions,Kindle Customer,4,-,29-Dec-13,-,0,"7 May 2014: Thanks to Google's omission of full USB OTG function, file transfers are frustrating & sometimes impossible. When I return home, I'm rooting it.

After 24 hours, I like it. It's a little different from my Galaxy Player 5 inch. The extra processor speed is nice. So is the combination of the light weight and larger screen. The GP5 was getting bogged down by software bloat. It fits nicely in my old K3 case. So far, so good.

...and it works with my Targus Bluetooth keyboard. Actually, it works better than it does with the GP5. The Samsung has some key-mapping problems, probably due to Gingerbread.

As to reading, I happened to be starting a novel the other day, and started it on the Nexus 7. I had no problem. I did keep the brightness on 'Auto', so the light level of the screen matched the ambient light. With the GP5, matching light levels was a little chancy, so I had a bit more eyestrain. (Of course the extra 2"" of screen have no bearing on that, right?)

I did try the freebie 'La Luna' video that Google gives away. It watched fine on the 7"" screen. The thing I really like is that there is a 7"" screen in the weight of a past-technology 5"" package. I owned a Nook color for 13 days, but took it back because of the weight and balance. It just wasn't comfortable to hold.

I haven't tried any significant music listening. I suspect I'll still prefer my Clip+ for that. The Nexus is a little large for that purpose. I also haven't tried the camera in any particular serious way. A selfie and a picture of my cat isn't much of a trial. Again, I'll probably use a purpose-made camera for real pictures. I also haven't explored portability yet. In the case, it's a bit bulky for easy transport, whereas the GP5 fits in my pocket next to my cell phone. I probably won't put the N7 in my pocket without a case. It's a little large and fragile seeming for that.

...As to the camera, it's OK, the image quality is fine, but a 7"" tablet just isn't a good ergonomic platform for picture taking. This is the best from an afternoon at Mass Audubon's Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary.

Picture is available at:
MobileRead Forums > E-Book Readers > Android Devices>Nexus 7 2013 1st Impressions

...And I still prefer my Clip+ for music. I hand to hunt around the Android store for a decent player for my collection which includes WMAs as well as MP3s. Google does not play WMAs (cue prissy, superior sniff). I settled on Poweramp, not because it was perfect, but because it was the first one I came to that was good enough. I just want to listen to some music, people, not commit my soul to a single, ringing, crystalline-pure music player that rules them all. Sheesh.

Someday I may do a better review, too. All of the usual things about tablets are at worst adequate on the N7.

Oh, one piece of free advice, worth every penny you paid: Don't go hog wild buying really great accessories. Shop around. A $3 wire easel from a craft store will make a fine desk stand. I have one at work and one at home. A chopstick and a binder clip will do in a pinch. Also, there are good $10 EVA zip cases that will protect your N7 for transport. They don't have to be purpose built. My old K3 had a case that loosely fits the N7 (freebie!) and my KPW1 lives in a similar case. As to ear buds, the candy-colored $5 ones in the bin at the cash register at WalGreens are my favorite, and you never misplace them, because candy-colored."
B00DVFLJKQ,240,2396,Great until it broke.,IamDeirdre,3,-,19-Sep-13,57,8,"I loved my Nexus 7, but I had it barely a month before the screen broke. It fell off my counter (about 2'), onto my foot and the LCD cracked. I had it in a protective leather case, but that didn't seem to matter. After doing some research online, screens cracking seems to be a common problem with no easy solution. Sending the Nexus back to Asus to be repaired will cost around $200, almost as much as getting a new one. Replacement parts are almost impossible to find, and cost around $180, if you want to DIY.

So beware, the Nexus is a great tablet, but quite fragile and accidents do happen, but they aren't covered by warranty!

B00DVFLJKQ,240,2397,Finally you get more than what you paid for.,Greg T,5,-,08-Dec-13,7,0,"****12/12/13 update: I took my first cross country trip with my Nexus 7. This is the first time I have EVER traveled without my laptop but I wanted to see if I could get by since it is so much easier and lighter to travel with a 7"" tablet than a 14"" laptop. I have to admit that I really enjoyed the trip. It is a 6 hour flight from NYC to LA so I downloaded 4 movies (2 from Google Play and 2 that I already had). I was able to watch 2 movies and play a few games that I have on my Nexus 7 and still had over 50% battery left. With the exception of not being able to play my favorite Facebook game due to the lack of Flash I did not miss my laptop at all. I had ZERO problems connecting and staying connected to the hotel wi-fi. I have not tried to use the GPS function yet since I use my Samasung Galaxy SIII for navigation but I am going to try since I have read some reviews that say the Nexus 7 has trouble keeping locked on to satellites.
Also tonight when I got back home my Nexus updated to 4.4.2. I have to admit that one of my favorite things about having a Nexus device is always having the most up to date rom without having to root the device.
I do follow this review and will be more than happy to respond to any questions you may have about the Nexus 7 (2013)

I have had the tablet for about 2 weeks now and so far it has lived up to my expectations. I did not buy it from Amazon but let me share how I got a great deal on it. During Black Friday week Walmart was offering the 2013 FHD model in 32gb for 229. Staples has a price match guarantee and was also offering a $50 off any tablet $149.99 and above. So I got the price match to Walmarts price and used the $50 off coupon for a total of 179.99 for the 32GB 2013 model.

Unpacking; After taking the Nexus 7 out of the box, turning it on and adding my account I was immediately met with an update is available. I was pleasantly surprised to see that my Nexus was updated to 4.4 KitKat. It's nice to buy a product directly supported by Google and not having to wait for another company to add their overlays before pushing the upgrades.

Design: It's thin, it's comfortable, it's light, and there's a perfect amount of bezel around the display. Furthermore, the combination of tough scratch-resistant glass and soft-touch plastic makes the Nexus 7 physically feel really nice when you're holding it, but equally tough: there's no flex in the build at all. One feature I really liked was the notification light below the display, glowing whenever you receive an email or Facebook message. Other than the logo you can find a 5-megapixel camera in the top corner surrounded by a large glass lens, as well as dual rear-facing speakers, which really enhances the sound quality while watching videos. Not enough devices of this size feature left and right speakers, and it's great to see Asus managing to squeeze this feature into the budget.

Display: Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of the Nexus 7 is the display, which seems to defy the price tag associated with the device. It sports a 1920 x 1200, IPS LCD panel with a density of 323 ppi. The high resolution and high pixel density of the Nexus 7's panel makes video watching and web browsing that much more enjoyable and text looks extremely sharp without any visible jagged edges. It's also nice to have a 7-inch tablet that can display 1080p movies at native resolution so you'll be getting the full clarity of Blu-ray playback without downscaling. Vibrant images look amazing on the display, and not far off what one would consider a `true to life' image. Contrast is very good, and white levels appear perfect with no color tinting to speak of. The display produces a decent amount of light, which helps significantly when you're trying to use the Nexus 7 outdoors or in a bright environment. It's actually very easy to read text on this tablet in all conditions. Auto-brightness also works well, adapting quickly to light changes.

Software: The Nexus 7 runs pure Android 4.4 'KitKat' without any device-specific customizations which, as I stated above, means you will receive new software updates as soon as they are available.

Performance: The nexus 7 features a quad-core processor clocked at 1.5 GHz, alongside an Adreno 320 GPU clocked at 400 MHz, an LPDDR3 memory controller, a Hexagon digital signal processor, and radios for Bluetooth 4.0 and dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n. The tablet also has 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage. Unfortunately there's no microSD card slot to expand the storage, though I still found it to be plenty of space. The Nexus 7 is a smooth and capable performer. Android feels well optimized for the device, so you're always getting the interface rendered at 60 frames per second with no lag to speak of. App switching is fast, and 2 GB of RAM allows a lot of applications to be stored for quick access. Improvements to both Android and Chrome, especially in recent months, have made Chrome much nicer to use. It can be a little slow when zooming in or switching tabs while you wait for the webpage to re-render, but overall I was happy with the browsing capabilities.

Battery: I found battery life to be very good thanks to software optimizations and a more power-efficient CPU. Whether you're browsing the web on Wi-Fi or watching a video, generally the tablet lasts at least nine hours, if not more if you use a low brightness setting.

Camera: The included 5-megapixel camera isn't the most amazing I've seen, images can appear a little grainy in dark conditions.
In near-perfect conditions, the Nexus 7 is a very capable camera. There isn't a huge range of shooting modes or settings to control image quality, but I found automatic white balance to function accurately most of the time, and photos were rarely overexposed. It does not have a flash, so it's no surprise that the Nexus 7 is unsuitable for photography in low-light conditions.

Summary: From the moment I powered on the new Nexus 7, I knew it would easily be the best 7-inch Android tablet. With a fantastic 1080p display that's ideal for gaming, reading and video watching, plus a slim and light design it's clear that Asus knows how to produce a solid tablet. It's very speedy and despite it's small battery the Nexus 7 gives decent battery life, thanks to clever software and firmware optimizations.

I am so far very happy with my purchase."

I never ever had any problems with it till now over a year later hahaha... It keeps on freezing up in the middle of doing something when it never did while running multiple apps on the background. Then eventually shuts downs automatically. The power battery icon shows up while charging, thou still has to be rebooted constantly. Its such a pain in the butt and to be honest I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I'm no expert or technician to diagnose why, what or how things happen the way the happen or what its causing this, why is acting like that? I do recall thou everything started with the new upgrade to Android 4.4.4. Then my headaches started along with it. Lol. I have been thinking bout upgrading to the new generation of Nexus 7, thou I'm a lil scared :( I don't know what to do.

__Have anybody in here had the same problem with your tablet before? If so, how did you fix it?

B00DVFLJKQ,240,2399,arrived as a smart and snappy tablet computer,FarVistas,1,-,08-Apr-15,5,0,"Google has abandoned early versions of the Nexus 7 - which implies that they will abandon later versions as the Android operating system is updated. My Nexus 7, ordered from Amazon on 2/22/2013, arrived as a smart and snappy tablet computer, a joy to use. With each successive update of the Android operating system, however, the Nexus 7 worked worse and worse. It is now almost unusable - slow, clunky, frustrating, making the user constantly irritated. If Google had just left it with the original operating system, it would still be a pleasure to use - they might have had to face complaints that we weren't getting upgraded to the latest version of Android, but at least we would have had a tablet we were happy to use. Now I and many other users are down on Android and down on Google, realizing that if they can abandon us at this stage, they will be abandoning other users later on. With each successive upgrade of the Android operating system, they will be abandoning those whose tablets were designed for an earlier version."
B00DVFLJKQ,240,2400,"Not a bad device, but be careful with it.",J,4,-,19-May-14,-,0,"When I first got the device in stores, I got a dead pixel, and returned it for a new one, which worked fine.

It has a beautiful screen and is pretty quick, and is the perfect size for a tablet in my opinion. The speakers are nice and it fits well in the hand, and I can get through the day with about 20% battery remaining. The one problem I had with the device, though, is that I went to bed one day and, not thinking, placed the device on my table upside-down with my cell phone on top of it. When I turned it on in the morning, I saw a blue almost airbrush effect on the screen in the corner when I'm viewing a black or dark image.

I then had this happen again when I placed the device in the laptop sleeve of a backpack in the opposite corner.

While this is completely my fault, my point is to be careful with the device, as I find that it's fragile compared to other tablets such as the Galaxy Tab 3 or even the previous generation Nexus. If you were to get a case or something for it, you should be good to go. And don't be afraid to return it if there's a dead pixel, etc. when you first get it; reports online say that manufacturer defects are more common than before with the Nexus 2013."
B00DVFLJKQ,241,2401,"Fantastic device for mobile emulation (N64, PSX, SNES, Genesis, etc.)",Conker,4,-,27-Aug-13,1,3,"There are literally hundreds of reviews and articles detailing the specs of the new Nexus 7, so I won't bore anyone with those.

What I really love about this tablet is the performance. It's lightning fast, which means it's great for emulation. The quad core 1.5 Ghz processor really comes in handy when running N64, SNES, and PSX emulators, and man does this tablet run them like a champ.

Playing Mario 64 or Wave Race 64 @ 1200p while sitting on my back porch is amazing. Having the 32 GB model means I've got plenty storage room for roms (you get about 26.5 GBs of space to use after the OS), which comes in handy for gaming on the go, especially for PSX games since they can be 300-700 Mb a pop. Cartridge based games like Nintendo 64 or SNES titles don't take up much space at all (2-50 Mb). Touch screen controls work surprisingly well on this device, especially held in landscape mode. Having more screen real-estate means a better feel when using the device as a virtual controller (compared to something really small like a smartphone). It also means the touch controls themselves don't interfere with the actual field of view (assuming you keep the original aspect ratio of 4:3 and don't stretch the image).

The touch controls, while perfectly adequate for keeping things very mobile, can't replicate the feel of a physical controller. Luckily, the device supports an array of devices that can be plugged into the mini USB port (via an OTG cable). In order to get some emulators to properly recognize a controller, the device needs to be rooted. For testing I used both a PS3 and Logitech Dual Analog controller (emulated as a 360 controller), and in both cases the only emulator to recognize either without further tampering was my N64 App. The others require the Sixaxis installation and root access. Not a big deal, just something to be aware of.

All other features work great. Web surfing, taking pictures/video are all fantastic. I especially love using the 3D picture feature, allowing you to stand in one position to capture a 3D view of your surroundings (very similar to what you see in street view on Google maps). It most certainly won't replace any quality cameras, but it's great for just taking quick shots on the go.

The 7"" size means it's actually quite easy to carry it in my pants pocket, which I do daily. My case still hasn't come yet, so I keep it wrapped in a microfiber cloth for protection.

Why 4 stars instead of 5? (would be 4.5/5 if I could choose) See below.

My first one soft bricked after about 4 days (wouldn't boot past the ""x"" logo). Luckily, I bought it at a local retailer and was able to get it swapped no problem, and haven't had any issues with the new once since (had it for about 4 weeks now). The other day, the tablet slipped off the bathroom counter and landed screen first on the floor. I about s*** a brick when I flipped it over and saw it had shut off (thinking that was all she wrote), but it powered up no problem, and there were no scratches/scuffs on the screen at all! Lucky me.

Something else I've noticed on the screen... it looks as though the protective coating is beginning to wipe away, specifically where I've been placing my thumb when playing on the PSX emulator. I'm not sure if it's due to excessive heat from the gpu/cpu under the hood, or my constant thumb pressure (or both). It's only noticeable when I wipe with with a moist micro fiber cloth and hold it under a light, but it's quite jarring nonetheless. There's also a small droplet size area in the top middle where the same thing is happening. I plan on contacting ASUS tonight to see about getting it RMA'd or replaced. It's not a big deal, but for a brand new device it shouldn't be happening.

Those are my thoughts and experiences with the device after a month. For what I wanted it for (mobile emulation and web access), it's great. Like I said, already plenty of reviews out there detailing specs and benchmarks, so read those if you want that information.

Edit Update:

As of now, all the emulators I currently use have native controller support via USB to OTG cable connection, no rooting required. I've tested my Logitech F310 on all my current emulators (SNES, N64, Genesis, and PSX) and it's working great. This obviously was not fault of the device itself, just merely a shortfall of the current apps available, but they have since been updated to support wired controllers out of the box."
B00DVFLJKQ,241,2402,My favorite tablet,Ben,5,-,21-Nov-13,2,0,"I have had the iPad, iPad 2, iPad 4 and this is by far my favorite. I love the size, much more portable and easier to put in pockets or whatever than the iPad. I also like the Google system of apps more than Apple, but that's more a personal choice.

The battery is phenomenal and usually gets me about 3 days of real-life use...reading, web browsing, games, music, etc.

The speakers are also really good on the top and bottom creating almost a stereo sound. Google has come a long way in what they offer and the hardware they produce. With the price and how fast everything is, I have jumped ship from Apple and am now totally Google. (also switched to the Nexus 5 from the iPhone 5) and have not looked back.

The Android OS is slightly less mature than iOS, but I prefer the customizability that is offered more than Apple where you can't customize anything beyond the background."
B00DVFLJKQ,241,2403,Decent But Not Great,Animal,2,-,30-Sep-14,-,0,"I was excited about getting the much touted Nexus 7 last November. Overall, it's been a decent experience but certainly not great. The three greatest disappointments? 1) Auto-rotate feature of the screen stopped working after about a year. 2) The battery drains rather quickly and takes a good while to charge. 3) Sound volume is mediocre at best. My little Samsung smartphone is way louder than my tablet.

Before purchasing the Nexus 7, I had a rooted Barnes & Noble tablet and I had far less problems with it than I did the Nexus. Although the B&N tablet was far less powerful and not as fast as the Nexus.

On a positive note, the Nexus tablet is fast, has an impressively clear screen, and good storage space. The GPS feature is good too.

I think I'm done with Google products. I had a Google MyPhone a few years ago and it wasn't that good either. Currently in the market for a new Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0""."
B00DVFLJKQ,241,2404,Don't Crack the Screen!,LAURA STRICKLAND,1,Yes,08-Apr-14,-,5,"I was given the 32 GB, 2nd generation Google Nexus for Christmas. The one month that my tablet was in working order I really enjoyed it. However, I was reading a book on my tablet in the kitchen and accidentally dropped it from my lap to the tile floor. The Google case did absolutely nothing to protect it. The glass cracked, and the touch screen was unresponsive. Since I had a security password on it, I can no longer get into it to retrieve any pictures. I called Asus in late January to see how much it would be to fix it. I was quoted $179, more or less. After waiting a few months to save the money to fix it, I called Asus and the price to fix it went up to $200! They had the nerve to tell me I should just buy a new one! Why would they make something that costs so much to fix? At this point, if I'm going to buy a new tablet, I'm getting an iPad mini that I know I can get fixed for $150."
B00DVFLJKQ,241,2405,Repairs cost as much as buying a new unit.,Steve,2,-,01-Oct-14,1,0,"It's very nice, but USB connection has gone bad so I can't power it up. (a google search will show that this problem is common with ASUS) Contacted ASUS and the repair cost is about the cost of buying a new unit. I've had my tablet for a little over a year before it went bad. Also, they will not sell the part so I can repair it myself.

While it works, it's nice, hence 2 stars. I just cannot afford this unit if I have to buy a new one very year or so. NO more ASUS for me.

BTW, I've purchased ASUS products for many years and normally they have been reliable, but if their idea of support is to charge the same price for a repair as it cost to replace it new... they have no support in my mind.

B00DVFLJKQ,241,2406,"An upgrade for the first gen, and THE ipad mini killer.",FLOWERPOWER2016,5,-,19-Oct-14,3,0,"Ive owned both generations of nexus 7s and I loved them both. Android seemed better out of the box w/ the first gen, but the 2nd gen caught up after a couple of fix's and Its lived up to my expectations every since. This has thinner bezels, a better glass , it feels smoother. This is gorilla glass2 , im not sure what the first gen was but I just like the way this feels. I do miss the way the back of the first gen felt, the dimpled almost leather feel but its no big deal. This gen is easier to hold, its lighter and it has the most vivid display ive seen on a 7 in tablet bar none. Every aspect of this tablet is better. It has stereo speakers instead of just one speaker, it has a rear camera. Taking scans w/ the first gen was impossible but this is smooth. The processor is snappy is they come and I haven't found a game I couldn't play. Its light enough to use this as an e reader but if you are one to read for hours, get a kindle for 80 bucks, it will suit you better and you wont worry about battery power. speaking of battery power , the battery charges now when plugged in and using it, where as the first gen drained the battery if you used it while it was charging. There a lot ore accessories available for the second gen, it took a while to get a good choice of covers and folios and stuff like that when the first gen came out. The volume buttons and power on buttons are still the same, very comfortable and easy to use and responsive. I was a first time android used w/ the first gen nexus and it took me about 2 weeks to get comfortable w/ it. well, id say about a week to get comfortable, 2 weeks to grasp the idea of it completely. Coming from windows a bit of a change but its a fun change and one that I haven't experienced since windows became the go to o/s back in the mid 90s. Overall , for the price, you will not find a better all around tablet experience. And for that matter, price being no concern you wont find a better one. The ipad mini w/ retina display is the nearest competitor for the second gen nexus 7 and even it only beats the nexus in one category in my opinion and that would be apps. Everyone knows apple has the apps down, esp the ones that work so well on the 7in platform but androids getting there and has came along way in a short short time. The future is very bright for this company so jump on board w/ them and see why they've sold so many of these tablets."
B00DVFLJKQ,241,2407,Fast CPU and GPU with Beautiful Screen Colors & Resolution,redrover,4,-,16-Aug-13,6,0,"08/31/2013: Q update is a big bust for me in regard to multi touch issues. I am now experiencing all kinds of touch issues, no response to touch and delayed responses. GPS still OK. HAVE TO RETURN AND WAIT TILL I KNOW IF THIS ISSUE CAN BE SOFTWARE FIXED. 4 STARS.

UPDATES ARE BELOW INITIAL REVIEW WITH LAST UPDATE ON 08/26/2013.
All issues seem to have resolved now that the Q update has been applied. The unit is great, easy on the eyes for reading, the size is so easy to hold and put into a pocket or purse. If it was 8 inches or larger would be difficult to hold easily in one hand and I know as my Ipad mini is just a tad difficult to hold for extended periods in one hand. The features for the price is the best you can hope to get...$269 for PPI resolution at or near the top of the line for tablets, decent memory price for 32GB, thinness, the rear back feel and I could go on. The unit to get for the extra $$ is the 32GB, 16GB you will likely regret if you have many apps.

The speed of games and all applications loading and running is fantastic. The screen resolution and colors are even more fantastic. The feel of the back and lightness of the unit and ability to hold in one hand is well above wonderful.

Video playback is smooth. Playing riptide is fast, smooth and downright super responsive. The back of the unit in the lower bottom above the charging port will get warm to the touch I would say from low to moderate warmth...nothing alarming. Stressing the GPU seems to bring it on.

The cameras are so-so but more than adequate. Rear camera a bit slow to focus as others have said. Random re-boots common but getting much better. The major issues that keep it from getting a 5 star and really should be 3 1/2 stars is the release issues that still need fixing.

ISSUES: GPS not updating in a timely manner as you use it; problematic touch issues ranging from ghost swipes, keyboard slow at times to respond to touches and the pinching/zooming is erratic at times; initial loading and customization of folders on two different units was lost when you would re-start unit saying ""Launcher has Stopped"" resulting in basically the unit going back to initial screen customizations when you first got the unit.

It went away after a factory re-boot. First unit did it twice till a factory re-boot but the replacement unit never needed a factory re-boot but did lose it once then never again.
Both units exhibit all the above issues and now the 2nd unit will not load past the X after it had been charging. I have tried to power down and re-start numerous times. I have left the X glowing for 4 hours and nothing. I hate to do a recovery and lose all my screen folder customizations...again.

Those that doubt the multi-touch issues download from app store YAMTT and play around with it...let's hope it is not a hardware issue.
I am thinking if hardware issue probably then limited to the initial production run and that the later units do not have issue based on other reviewers statement that their units have no such issue. OR MAYBE THEY NEED TO TEST USING YAMTT!!!

The unit is 3 1/2 stars due to the issues but once GOOGLE/ASUS (I hope) fix these issues will be a 5 star. I will return and wait till I read the issues are solved before buying another. I now have on order several screen protectors and cases from Amazon for a tablet I will no longer have in a few days...ugh.

Additional issues are during your first setup of the unit or during a factory recovery when you sign in to your Google account and establish a WiFi connection...the apps all get download and updated...all apps regardless if you want them or not.

You have to quickly stop this at the app store settings then download each one at a time which is a pain too if you have a lot of apps. Also during the mad rush to download all your apps it causes many to cycle endlessly downloading so again best to stop and do it yourself.

The unit is fantastic and I just hope Google and Asus fix the issues before the release of the next iPad mini...it would be a shame for sales to be lost due to these issues...I do like the New Nexus 7. The back is such an improvement in its grip ability and oh the apps just run so fast and smoothly. Chrome still has issues and hiccups but most browsers do.

UPDATED 08/21/2013: I used the GPS for about 30 minutes using my smartphone to provide an internet connection for the Nexus. The GPS worked flawlessly with no lag.
I am unsure if the GPS on the nexus is suppose to work without an internet connection or work from the satellite alone?

The screen touch issues are better but typing and ghost taps still evident. No reboots, no freezes and the touch app seems to indicate that the touch screen issue seems to be gone.

I have not returned this second unit but will in a day or so. I will wait a few weeks before repurchasing.

But I will say I love the unit and will repurchase even if all the issues are not fixed!

UPDATE 08/24/2013:
I returned my 2nd unit and picked up another yesterday because supposedly GOOGLE releasing an OTA update that fixes multi touch and GPS issues. Updated release is suppose to be JWR66Q...link address but I do not know how to apply is: [...]

The unit I just returned, the GPS was working flawlessly and I tested in actual driving conditions for over an hour and with with GPS apps. The touch issue though was noticeable especially during typing. The build on that version was JWR66J.

The third unit after the setup and GOOGLE update has a build of JWR66N. OMG...GPS apps will not lock onto any satellites and Touchscreen apps still report issues. I will say that typing is nearly flawlessly and no ghost taps are evident even though the touch apps say otherwise. But GPS is gone...will try and test while driving.

I was sure I would get the latest update and so placed my screensaver on this unit...I will wait a few more days and hope GOOGLE rolls update out to me. My cases should arrive next week...I hope I do not have to return another unit.

Updated 08/25/2013: Well I called both Google and Asus and neither admitted a problem nor if this update exist. Well I returned it and got basically same unit with seem touch issues and totally non-functional GPS...the N update is the worst. I am sorry I ever turned in my 2nd unit which had the J update...

Updated 08/26/2013: The unit finally got the Q update. The typing remains nearly flawless and any mistakes probably due to my butterfingers. The GPS apps seem to lock onto the satellites within 2-3 minutes. I will test GPS out on the road over the next few days.
The Touchscreen app seem to indicate that multi-touch issues are gone or pretty close to gone.

Note that many of the above issues like: Launcher stopped has not occurred since the 3rd unit; nor do all apps in your PlayStore download automatically unless you request them to be donwloaded to your device.

Poetic cases will be here tomorrow and I still have one screensaver to use...waiting to make sure all is OK with this FOURTH exchanged unit!!!

Kudos to Google to getting an update out in under 3 weeks..who knows if this was an Apple problem how long before they tried to fix let alone admit an issue. FIVE STARS...HOPE NO MORE ISSUES.

Get the unit and splurge for the 32GB...you will want the extra capacity and the cost for features is the best money can buy. I can not say enough on the screen clarity compared to my other owned tablets of: Samsung 10.1 Tab2 and Ipad 2 and a Mini-Ipad.

I will try and upload when I have time a screen shot of the update screen with the Q update."
B00DVFLJKQ,241,2408,Nexus 7 2013: This tablet sucks,Robert A Poe,1,-,09-Jun-14,5,2,"Less than a month after buying this tablet for my son, it stopped charging. Buying a new mico-USB cable helped for a while, but then it started acting up again. Sometimes jiggling the cable in the connector socket helped, but usually it didn't.

Finally we contacted Asus and they gave us a repair order. We had to pay one way for shipping to Plano Texas. Had to download some software to back up the apps and data because we were warned they might have to replace the mother board, which meant we would lose all our data.

Sent it off, then we waited and waited for the repair. One week, nothing. Two weeks, nothing. A month later, still nothing. The repair tracking site just said ""waiting."" Called to find out what was wrong, and they said they would give it their highest priority.

Got it back, and it looks like they didn't replace the mother board because a lot of the apps were still there. Didn't notice any difference in how it looked, but they included a new charging cable when they shipped it. I don't know if they fixed anything, because they didn't include any information about what they did.

A month later and it is doing the same thing. Charges for a while, then the lighting bolt in the middle of the charging icon disappears even though we didn't touch a thing. Charges for a while then stops. Jiggle the cable in the socket and it may or many not start charging again.

The micro USB socket is flimsy and low quality. We bought this because it was cheaper than an iPad mini. But it cost a lot more and aggravation than the money we saved.

Don't buy this piece of low-quality crap!"
B00DVFLJKQ,241,2409,"No problems, prefer it to iPad Mini w/ Retina",M. Lee,5,-,17-Nov-13,7,0,"I didn't buy my Nexus 7 through Amazon, but wanted to review it nonetheless. I have used both the Nexus 7 and the new iPad Mini with Retina Display. I own both Apple and Android devices. For me personally, I prefer the Nexus 7 though I see the appeal of both. ]

First of all, I've had zero issues with my Nexus 7 that I've owned for about a month and a half now. Other users complained of GPS issues (which i believe have been corrected with updates), screen flicker, etc. I've had none of these. I also prefer the selection of the Google Play store vs the Apple App store. Some of my favorite features of the Nexus 7 are the built in GPS, the customization options (home screen, widgets, etc), Ok Google, Qi (wireless) charging, Google Currents, Google Talk integration, Google Play Music, being able to gain root access to the device, and I prefer the size of the Nexus (I can throw it in my pocket).

At the same time, if you want a very simplified locked down interface, don't care about customization etc the Mini is also a very nice device. I'm a techie, I like to fiddle with things and like to have control of my device. That is why I prefer the new Nexus."
B00DVFLJKQ,241,2410,Quit Working,Janyth,1,-,14-Apr-15,-,0,"I bought this as my first tablet 2 years ago... including instruction book, case, Bluetooth keyboard. The works. I don't use it as often as I thought I would, but it is handy, especially on trips. I also bought a Chromecast for my TV to pair with it-- all was good. But with limited use in 2 years, suddenly it started doing strange things. It just goes dark for no reason. I reboot (which takes a long time)... all is fine... and then it goes black again. It used to respond instantly to my touch -- now I have to jam my finger on it and hold it down for it to do anything. Apple will never be an option for me, but I am researching the 7"" Amazon Fire HDX, knowing that my case & keyboard will probably not work with it. I am very disappointed in this product (I bought it from Radio Shack so there isn't much recourse there...)."
B00DVFLJKQ,242,2411,Great until it stopped working!!,JamRock,1,-,04-May-14,6,4,"I purchased this in store on April 7 2014, few weeks go by and I am loving this device. Than on April 26 I plug it in to charge and go to use it a few hours later and the screen will not turn on. The device still works as I can hear it unlock using facial recognition. I can also guess where the numbers are and unlock the device that way too. I can make it ring using find my android. I can also plug it in to a PC and browse the files. Just what appears to be a randomly broken screen. No damage to the device at all and it has never been dropped. I babied the device.
After calling best buy and learning their return and exchange policy is ONLY 15 days and that they would not take it back, I called google. Google was no help and told me to call Asus. Asus gave me an RMA number and I have to return it at my own expense for warranty repair. Btw, they say they may send you a re-manufactured or re-certified device in its place.....I have a screen protector on the device which will ruin the protector if I remove it, so I guess that is also more money down the drain. To make it worse I will have to pay for data while my device is away getting repaired or replaced.
If you google nexus 7 screen problems or nexus 7 power problems. It's scary the amount of people with similar problems. There are all sorts of different power on/off sequences with power on and volume buttons to try and fix but none of them actually do.
Will report back with what my experience with Asus is like. Very disappointed in best buy. If they can't guarantee a product for at least 30 days then they do not deserve my future business. Lots of other retailers both on and offline which still do 30 day.

update: May 7 2014,

Asus has had the device for 1 full week now, they have not been able to provide me a status online or through their support team. I am beginning to fear the worst. Their online status webpage says it take 1 business day after receiving item to update status. Asus support says devices are typically turned around in 5 to 7 days. Both statements have come to be false!"

I made the mistake of upgrading to Android 5 and now my Nexus is basically a door stop with no practical way to revert back to Android 4. So, I would not recommend this tablet to any one. I keep waiting for an Android 5 update that might return my Nexus to working order, but I've been waiting for months. Friends with iPads do not have this inexcusable problem. My next tablet will be from Apple."
B00DVFLJKQ,242,2414,Using it a lot more than I thought I would,Dan,5,-,28-Apr-14,2,0,"I went out shopping for a tablet to run Dashmeter Pro in a sim racing cockpit I have (Obutto Ozone). At first that was my only reason for buying into the android family. I was looking for something around $100 for that purpose alone. I have an iPhone and recently sold an iPad 2 because I never used it. It was bulky and uncomfortable to hold on to. Without a case it was even harder to hold onto.

Enter the Nexus 7. Working in IT and selling online I knew all about it. I just didn’t think I would use a tablet after not using the iPad. Again I thought my only purpose for a tablet would be to run my sim racing gauges. I went to the local best buy to take a look at those $100 tablets and realized that they were seriously terrible. I looked at a 7” Samsung tab ($140) side by side with the nexus and while it was nice it took about twice as long to do anything on it. After some deliberation I decided to go for the 32gb Nexus in hopes that maybe I would use it around the house a little bit.

I am happy to report that I haven’t put this thing down since I brought it home. Coming to android from iOS is like a breath of fresh air. I can do more of what I want to on this tablet. It’s light and powerful, easy to hold and the screen is amazing. Love that the back is the matte material that is ultra-easy to grip onto. I’ve been using it nonstop for web browsing, youtube, hulu and games. I highly recommend NBA Jam! Anyway the tablet is excellent at everything. I am using it waaayyy more than I ever used my iPad. Plus at $250 it’s much cheaper than the 6 or $700 I spent on the iPad.

A few cons but nothing serious. Out of the box it doesn’t support DTS audio. Not a huge deal. There is a work around for it and honestly files with DTS audio are too big to be using on a mobile device anyway. That brings me to the next concern which is no expandable memory. Get the 32gb to be on the safe side. No one ever said “I wish I had less space” on a device. There are some USB options for more space but not as clean as having a micro sd card.

Overall it’s an excellent tablet and well worth the money. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again or recommend it to others. You really can't go wrong picking this tablet over others at even higher price points."
B00DVFLJKQ,242,2415,"Tried all the rest, this model is nowhere the best (Not even close)",Danielle,1,-,22-Mar-17,1,0,"When it comes to motherboards, Asus beats most competitors hands down. When it comes to tablets, they should never have gotten involved in the industry. For one, the Nexus is an extreme fire hazard. I had bought 4 of these for my family, and had to replace have the components within the first two weeks out of my pocket because ASUS skirted responsibility. Despite being sealed brand new in a box, one of the tablets was an obvious repair as it had a tech sticker pointing to what was bad which actually never was taken care of before it was resold. Lets start with the issues.
The first day of charging, one of the chargers cables burned my landlords rug. They all ran very hot. Two out of the 4 which had the normal UL approved stamp on them I was able to verify had changes made after the approval which would never have passed inspection. The cable was flimsy and shielding was cracked around the connectors. All 4 tablets had charging issues which was caused by the faulty micro USB port which was loos on every tablet. Very bad solder/welding jobs and extremely cheap. I bought $15 replacement's which was much better quality. The loose ports was a huge contributor to the charger and cables running hot.
One of the Tablets were DOA, which was a bad screen. They claim to test these units before shipping out. I seriously doubt that, because the screen that was bad was missing the flex cable, so how they tested it and OK'd it to ship, is a surprise to me. After buying the $10 cable, the screen still was dead which was about another $125.00. Would of been $45, but unfortunately I don't have the equipment to separate the digitizer from the LCD display so was forced to buy the whole digitizer setup.
One unit kept shorting out which was due to improper shielding and allowed shorting with very little pressure to the screen.
Then the unit with the crushed broken screen because I sat on it accidentally. (Oh wait, that is my fault isn't it? Guess I'll give them a half a star later, after they return my calls on the other issues)
Screws missing in key parts. This was discovered after opening one for the first time. I gather the double stick tape they used to insulate the micro USB port they assumed was strong enough to keep the port in place. (NOT!)
The chargers themselves were poorly designed as I mentioned above. Two out of the 4 produced no power at all. I highly suggest getting a replacement charger for this unit if you plan buying one. Actually, the money you save buying one of these can go toward the parts your most likely going to need to actually charge one up. New adapter, new charging cable. Lets not even bother to discuss support. The chances of actually getting someone once you select tablet is almost the same chances of winning the lottery. Try emailing them, they respond were sorry, we didn't get your previous emails, please give the following information so we can assist you. The funny part here, it included my previous messages I had sent them that they just said they never got in the first place. And better yet, when they reply to complaints like the one I'm leaving here, they leave a phone number asking you to call them which goes to the same annoying system that goes to absolutely nothing other than a infinite hold. ASUS, if your not going to hire staff for your tablet support and leave us on hold, please at least invest in a cheap $50 elevator music system. Listening to the same advertisement 2000 times over on how your tablets are the rave, makes one feel as if they just downed 30+ white castle cheeseburgers then take a ride on the gravatron at the amusement park.
My daughters unit she complained she couldn't get sound, even without the headset. That was due to the unit missing the headset jack. I see the price has doubled here. I spent $150 for each one when they came out, then about an additional $125 average in replacement parts per unit. I hope the rise in price was to fix the issues that came with the units. I'll say this, if this was my first ASUS product, I would never have gone near another of theirs ever. Even after all this chaos, I still bought several of their motherboards last year which my 10 year old daughter with my help, built her own and her brothers own I7 servers. As I said above, stay clear of their tablets. Their motherboards, their the best. After seeing these tablets and reviews, I suggest getting RCA Galileo Pro 11.5"" 32GB Tablet with Keyboard Case Android 6.0 BLACK Touchscreen These run great. I bought 4 of these and have had no issues. The few I talked with who complained of them being slow, was because they bought the cheapest micro SD card to increase ram. If you want speed and accuracy, you don't buy a $8 micro SD card.

Absolutely nothing. And when anything did load, it crashed. I spent hours trying to fix it through looking at forums and doing research. Nothing worked..

Perhaps I should accept engineered obsolescence, but I paid hundreds of dollars for this and expect a somewhat reasonable life out of it. I won't be buying a Nexus again. My current Nexus is sitting on the floor in the corner because it's so infuriating to use."
B00DVFLJKQ,242,2417,DO NOT BUY - Many are defective!,EricInDayton,1,-,31-Mar-15,4,0,"DO NOT BUY! Let me first start by saying that I am ordinarily a huge fan of both Asus and the Nexus product line -- and while it worked, I loved my 2013 Nexus 7 32GB tablet. It became my main computing device for email, web surfing, media, etc. HOWEVER - it died one month after the warranty expired. Asus wants $200 to fix it because it is out of warranty! Do an internet search on ""nexus 7 2013 won't boot"" - there are MANY, MANY people that have the 2013 model and had it die within a couple months after the warranty expired. Asus seems to have a serious design or manufacturing flaw with this device - their earlier models don't seem to have this issue. We also have a 32GB 2012 Nexus 7 that is still working just fine and my wife loves it. Seems like class action lawsuit material to me. Also - if you get one of these, be sure to back up EVERYTHING.

B00DVFLJKQ,242,2418,Outstanding performance and incredibly sharp image quality!,Charles,4,-,17-Jun-14,1,1,"I want to start by saying that it has a jaw-dropping resolution. Sound is very crisp, but not loud enough when noise is present wherever you are. Although it has had very minor issues (that have nothing to do with hardware), they have been solved as Android has released new versions of the software for this tablet. The only aspect that I hate about companies different than Samsung is that they do not let expand memory on their devices. In fact, I thought it was going to be trouble, but I haven't even used half of my memory because I prefer the cloud, which in my opinion is a hundred times more reliable. Also, I have the highest Internet speed in my area, so online storage for me is very accesible. Overall, I would definitely recommend it to anyone. A very simple advice to those who are not advanced tablet users and don't know how much space they should buy is to get any tablet that has at least 32 GB of memory. Trust me on that, because 16 GB is most of the time not enough. I hope I have helped all of you with this review. Good luck with the Nexus 7!"

I am an Android and an IOS user - I don't really have an OS bias. The screen on the 7 is what really sold it - nice color range, very bright, text is beautiful and sharp. I am reading much smaller fonts than I typically use. It is also light, thin and fast. The camera is fair, though an led lamp would be nice, maybe placed on the front for video calls in dim light. My iPhone has a wonderful camera, so this is not a biggie. Speakers are small, so not very loud, but they sound very good for their size - placement was thoughtful - good separation.

Setup was a breeze. I provided my Google account information, and all my previous app purchases and settings from my original Motorola Xoom tablet were automatically installed - that's it... done!

Cons [you were looking for the cons, weren't you?]:

-Screen is ""touchy"" (pun intended) - sometimes a touch doesn't register - not a huge concern for me;

-WiFi cut-out regularly, when watching streaming video - it seems, however, that the 4.4.2 update MAY HAVE CORRECTED this as I haven't experienced it since updating last night - too soon to be sure;
[Updated 12/14/2013: After a few days of the 4.4.2 update, the wifi has only cut out one time - with several uses. It seems that the update has mostly fixed the problem.]

-Battery life had not been what I expected, even with minimal power settings, and using airplane mode when not online. I suspect that I have better battery life with the 4.4.2 update - again, too soon to be sure;
[Updated 12/14/2013: I have noticed increased life in the battery, but I also made some changes to my ""notifications"" and set other power options to minimal. I put the Power widget on my home screen, to make turning wifi on and off simpler, too. If you go to ""Settings>Apps"" and turn off notifications on your gmail, facebook, and other apps, you can manually refresh when you check these applications, but they don't check for updates on their own - this seems to save quite a bit of power throughout the day.]

-Amazon Instant Video is NOT supported here! Come On, Amazon! Give a guy a break!

Other notes:

I purchased one of those slim covers, similar to the origami style that the iPad was famous for. [MoKo Google New Nexus 7 FHD 2nd Gen Case - Ultra Slim Lightweight Smart-shell Stand Case for Google Nexus 2 7.0 Inch 2013 Generation Android 4.3 Tablet] Nice case - Inexpensive, lightweight, and attractive. The folding cover is touchy when used as a stand, but it keeps a slim profile while protecting the tablet [I know... It fell onto the tile floor last night!].

The iPad Mini Retina is a beaut! I simply cannot justify spending $500 for the 32GB version when this Nexus is available at less than half the price. If price (and availability) weren't a factor, I'd have bought the iPad Mini Retina, but price is a factor, and the Nexus 7 is, without a doubt, the best bang for the buck on the market today.

I hope to update this post when I have more experience with the 4.4.2 update, but I wanted to get my 2-cents in. Thanks again for playing. Let the flames begin!"
B00DVFLJKQ,242,2420,Very poorly built !!!,Amazon Customer,3,-,01-Aug-14,2,1,"Pros: Nice and compact, Features more apps then anyone can imagine, easy to transport.

cons: THIS IS A BIG CON TOO !!! This tablet is made VERY VERY POORLY !!! Pay particular attention to the charging system. I bought mine from a approved dealer, DID NOT pay for the insurance because I pissed away $300 on the device itself. I have remanufactured laptops that are three years old with NO problems. I will be contacting customer support.

Conclusion: If this is the best bang for your buck then stay away from these devices or just mail your $300.00 to Asus/google tell them to keep the device, your basically giving it to them anyway. I have never givin' such a terrible review, however, I expected A LOT BETTER BUILT PRODUCT for the money. Now I know how Asus/Google make a profit every quarter. The only reason I gave it two stars is because WHEN it works, it is great !

UPDATE !!! 8/28/14
I called customer service, I was treated in a professional manner, as expected...they took my info, had me send it on to Texas, via my treat. Package arrived in Texas within 3 days. I waited two weeks for them to notify me that the package was either on the way or not their problem. A few days later I came home from work to find a package sitting on the porch of my house which is on a very busy NOISY street...I opened it to find a nexus. I was shocked they would 1)Not notify me that it is coming so I could expect it...2) had it dropped off at the porch like that. I live on a corner of two busy streets, I know, sucks to be me. I guess I should be thankful that I received it at all, huh ???. Thanks NEXUS !!! It is a new unit with my existing charger and cable. Everything I had is lost (that part is my fault)...Anyway, I have a feeling this device will be ""non-usable"" within six months so for now I will enjoy it, because as I said WHEN it works it's great ! You may want to purchase EXTRA insurance because it's a matter of time. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars...customer service at this time gets a (3). Not a strong 3 mind you."

I don't know much about either processor. I know, snapdragon = longer battery life, and that Nvidia = batter graphics. The sound quality from this is very quiet. It's like the same quality as the older version. I can't really say, I bought mine refurbished. The screen does look a lot better too. Very bright and colorful. This tablet is great for I got it for.

I have iPad 1, iPad 3 (aka New iPad), and Kindle Fire HD (older). I also bought a Samxung Galaxy Tab 7 16GB.
Though I like the iPads, I wanted a cheaper and Android tablet. I don't really use the Kindle as I don't like the interface. I am really liking this one. The screen is really bright and has greater than 1080p resolution versus the Samsung XGA-ish(?).

It seems faster than the Samsung which I returned. I wanted something to use more cloud based so wasn't worried too much about the lack of expansion slot. The 32GB which should be enough to download temporary otherwise I will be using Google Play, HBO Go, etc.

I also got a chromecast and wanted something easy to use with that. This works well for that too.

It works great for watching uTube or Netflix, reading books or magazines, or casual web surfing, but accuracy of the touch interface is often poor and frustrating. I bought this mostly to access certain web sites containing many links and buttons, but it continually thinks I'm touching someplace else, sometimes with unfortunate consequences. It would be funny if it wasn't so frustrating. I often have to zoom in a long way to get it to select the link that I want. I have a 4 inch Samsung media player (no longer sold and basically a 4 inch tablet) that is easier to navigate web pages with than this Nexus 7. I should have spent much more time in the store testing the screen and comparing it with other offerings. I wish I had taken the money spent on this and applied it to the purchase of a Surface Pro. Because of the inaccuracy of the touch screen and the importance of that for my use, and for that alone, I would not purchase this again."
B00DVFLJKQ,243,2424,"Quite a good tablet, but has some build issues",Nth Doctor,4,-,30-Nov-13,3,0,"I picked this Nexus 7 model up a few months ago at a Best Buy store. I really have enjoyed it in the past several months I've been using it, and I wanted to discuss some of my experiences with it.

First of all, tablet Android has really come a long way. I remembered having another Android tablet back in 2011, and I ended up selling it because the app selection really wasn't there yet. But it seems like since the release of last year's Nexus 7 that tablet development has really started to pick up. Add in the fact that it's also a stock Android device, and you can see why people want to buy it instead of settling with skinned or modified versions of Android. The Nexus 7 has pure, vanilla Android on it. At the time I write this, the latest version of Android, Kit Kat, has already been released on it.

The app ecosystem dramatically improved. I use a lot of nice apps that work on tablet and phone, and there are a few that just work better on the tablet alone, like any comic or ebook readers. If you're somebody who loves to play games, you'll probably love the Nexus 7 even more than a phone. It always seems to me that game developers love tablets. There's so many games to choose from it makes your head spin.

I never used last year's Nexus 7, but I do know of the improvements in this new one compared to that model. For one, the new Nexus 7 has a screen capable of 1080p resolution. It's also got this matte black finish on the back, where it says ""NEXUS"" on it. If you hold the tablet the default, portrait style, then you'll find the volume buttons and power button to your right side towards the top. On the back side to the left is the camera. The camera quality isn't anything to write home about, but it doesn't matter much to me, as I rarely ever bother using it. But considering it's even an option now (last year's Nexus had no camera), I guess you can say having the option is better than not having it.

At the bottom of the tablet is the USB port, where you can plug in any standard micro USB to charge it or connect it to your PC. Then just behind that on the back are the speaker grills. They're not remarkably strong, but they work. Plus, I have a wireless bluetooth speaker if I ever want to listen to audio on it at a higher quality.

So it's got a lot of improvements because tablet Android has had more time to mature, and the Nexus 7's hardware has been improved compared to last year's. I never used last year's tablet, but this one has excellent battery life as well. It can go over 2 days on a full charge for me. I don't really pay too much attention to specs on these tablets. So long as they're not very low-end like pre-paid Android phones, then I can see myself buying it.

I really do like my Nexus 7, but I had to deduct a star because the build quality isn't as great as I was hoping. I'm quite careful with my devices, and I treated my Nexus 7 no differently. However, one day I took it out of my messenger bag and found the corner was damaged. The screen wasn't affected, but it looked like something hit the bottom right corner of the tablet hard enough to break off some of the plastic. It's kind of a chip. It really annoyed me to see it, so I eventually ordered a case that would cover it up.

That's not too bad, since the case covers up that damage and also prevents more. The case I ordered is one of those CruzerLite silicone/plastic sleeves with the Android robot on it. It adds a bit of style to my Nexus 7's plain look. I was satisfied, until one day I tried wiping the screen's smudges off. Then I realized that there was a scratch on the screen that would not go away no matter how hard I tried to get rid of it. I had to order a screen protector that claims to cover and fill scratches on screens, and I suppose that it's working because I can't see it anymore.

I am a bit disappointed in how easily the Nexus 7 took this mysterious damage because I am always careful with my devices. The build quality isn't as sturdy as you would believe, as I've seen from the damage it's taken. I'm very disappointed that the screen even took a scratch, considering that you can buy a phone like the HTC One with its nigh unscratchable screen (there's a YouTube video of somebody trying to use a screwdriver to scratch the HTC One's bare screen and failing to leave any damage) and sturdy aluminum unibody, yet you can't buy a flagship tablet that has the same build quality. I know the price is quite good, but I actually wouldn't mind paying a bit more for a stronger, better-built, flagship tablet.

However, it's still 4 stars because it's still a very usable tablet, even with the minor damage mine has. It still responds and works as it should. I would recommend it only if you buy it with a protective case (a case that actually protects or covers it, not a folio case) and a good screen protector. It's not as sturdy as you'd think, so be prepared to take very good care of it. The improved app ecosystem makes it all worth it."
B00DVFLJKQ,243,2425,The triumphant sequel to the original N7,Kay One,5,-,12-Aug-13,3,0,"The original Nexus 7 was a runaway hit for Android tablets when it was released in 2012, paving the way for all the mini sized Android tablets to follow. Like all Nexus devices it featured stock Android OS which is a huge draw for many, given its slick, clutter free interface, fast operation and prompt OS update schedule. Also being a Nexus device it was a favorite among enthusiasts who like to root and modify their Android devices.

Flashforward to mid 2013, the sequel to the N7 was released with eager anticipation from many, including owners of the 1st gen N7, new Android tablet buyers and others. At first I tried to resist the desire to upgrade since at the time, I was perfectly happy with my 1st gen Nexus 7 and just started getting into customizing it. Of course a friend of mine who picked up the new N7 asked for my help to root and customize and after a couple days of using it, I fell in love and purchased one, putting my old N7 for sale.

Some of the pros over the old tablet

1. SIZE - slimmer profile with no reduction in screen size, making this even easier to hold one handed as many will do with a 7"" tablet.

2. SCREEN - the increased resolution from 1280x800 to 1920×1200 with 323 dpi, and while the previous display looked fine, the improvements in the new display really show, with txt and details even crisper than before. with great color and contrast and wide viewing angles, of course with a glass display it is a challenge to read outdoors in the direct glare of sunlight, but this is inherent in most color tablets

3. PERFORMANCE - screen scrolling and animations are smoother and even snappier than the previous gen tablet, powered by the Snapdragon S4 Pro (which is infact a slightly detuned S600 CPU) versus the older Tegra processor from the previous N7 and the increased power shows

4. ERGONOMICS - as mentioned before the narrower profile makes this easier to one-hand hold, fit into large pants or coat pockets and the matte back finish while smooth compared to the dimpled back of the previous N7, gives it in fact a more premium feel and is still grippy and easy to hold.

5. OS - The tablet comes with Android 4.2.2 out of the box but as soon as you connect it to your wifi, it will immediately prompt you to upgrade to Android 4.3 so as of the date of this review, it is one of the first devices to have the newest version of Android OS, which has some nice incremental improvements including the new low energy BT standard, better graphical response and compatibility with new products like Chromecast

For new Android tablet buyers, this is a fantastic choice and I can't recommend it enough. For owners of the older N7, if you are happy with the performance, then there is no immediate reason to upgrade but if you want to give it a try, then I won't discourage it by any means.

I have no personal experience with the iPad or iPad mini so I cannot comment about comparative performance or specs, I say try both and talk to other owners."

I really like the interface and how friendly it is...I like the hardware and the performance that is really fast and makes a big difference than the older version....The device would have been perfect for me if not for one main issue...

The touch screen...

I highly recommend every one to read in google about the touch screen problems in (sooo many) of this device, it's a terrible issue that neither asus nor google has issued or tried to deal with very well...Just try to read about it, it's a sincere advice to you all.

I owned this device for few months, I mainly used it for e-mailing and reading e-books.

After some time, the touch screen starts to have REAL problems, like:
1- Dead spots where your touch input is not recognized.
2-Ghost touches on some spots of the screen, so annoying, it kept flipping pages while I was reading, or typing extra characters while I'm writing emails etc....
3- When you're doing multi-touch it's ok, unless your fingers are on the same (vertical or horizontal) line, then it acts like it's not being touched at all.

I read about these problems on the internet, and it seems like there are lots of people having these problems (not necessarily the exact same problems as mine but touch input issues in general).

Again, if yours is fine, then you're lucky, if you have not bought it yet, then be careful! Read in google and decide for yourself...

I don't know if it's a software issue or hardware, but me as a customer I should not worry about these things before I buy something, I only need a working device...

But...I do believe it's a software issue. Because after I restart it /reset settings, it works fine for two days and then it goes bizarre after that."
B00DVFLJKQ,243,2430,Wisest move I ever made was exchanging Kindle Fire HDX for this guy,M. Murphy,5,-,05-Aug-14,2,0,"Got this tablet after trying the Kindle Fire HDX, and after paying extra money for the HDX to not have advertising on the screensaver, I was sorely disappointed in not only the lack of customize-ability, but also in the lack of access to the Google Play Store (which is vastly superior to the Amazon app store).

Initially had some problems with the battery draining while idle, but a quick google search on some wi-fi settings to change quickly remedied that problem, and that has literally been the only complaint I've had in the 3 months I've owned it so far.

Does a great job as a Kindle reader, I watch Netflix on it, and sometimes take notes with the new Evernote update which allows for handwriting on android devices (although doing so on a 7"" screen can be a little clunky). Nexus 7 definitely won the Pepsi challenge when pitted against Kindle Fire HDX for me."

The sound is good relative to it's size, the dimensions are very good and user friendly.

My only minor criticism is the lock/unlock button is very small, as is the volume rocker switch. Ideally, I would like to see the switches a little bitter, and perhaps painted white to make them a little easier to find and differentiate. Minor gripe.

I have owned a few tablet and this is the best one yet, especially at this price point. I would suggest getting the 32g version."
B00DVFLJKQ,244,2432,"Solid 7"" Tablet",PLin,4,-,11-Dec-13,3,0,"Pros: Good price, excellent display, fast, good size

Cons: No external SD card slot, navigation buttons take up some of the display

This second iteration of the Nexus 7 is pretty good and improved upon a lot of the shortcomings with the first one. The screen is very sharp and displays colors accurately. The resolution is very good for a 7"" display. Text, images, and video all look good on it.

The size is also pretty good; it fits comfortable in my hand, but might be a little big for someone with smaller hands. One thing I don't like about the Nexus 7 is how the navigation buttons at the bottom actually take up some of the 1920x1200 display, so you lose some of the screen real estate. It's not a big deal, but the actual usable area is smaller. I think they went with this implementation so the buttons re-orient when you flip the screen.

The battery is above average. I'm not a heavy user, but I'm able to read the news, check email, and watch videos without having to worry about the battery draining or keeping it constantly charged.

I haven't seen a Kindle Fire HDX in person, but I think the two are very comparable. I decided to go with the Nexus 7 because I prefer a vanilla version of Android over the Fire OS."

There are software problems when sometimes you get stuck at the boot load up screen. Solution is to restore factory settings. For me to do this I ended up in recovery mode and I had a message saying ""no command"" . There was nothing I could do I was on the brink of returning this thing.

With it off (completely) the charge indicator on screen just starts at the bottom and blinks upward forever. This is a problem that developed on many of the Nexus 7 tablets after updating to 4.4 Kit Kat. This is such a wide spread problem that you can just search online for “slow charging Nexus” and find this.

Apparently Google is going to do nothing to fix this. :( My 2012 Nexus was literally taking 20 hours to charge after the 4.4 update, and now it doesn't charge either at all. The indicator shows “charging” but never advances. Some might call this a defective product as the producer is also the one that released the operating system, One can blame the other, but ultimately, they are the same.

It's fast like everyone says, with front and rear cameras, and battery life also lasts surprisingly long ~9 hours. Why am I giving it 2 stars then?! Well, the manufacturing process stinks! If you carefully look at your front camera, I bet it's not even centered. I got four Nexus 7 from W-mart and 3 of them had dead pixels; the fourth unit had a big dust particle between the front camera and the glass so I didn't even bother testing it for dead pixels. I immediately got a refund. 4 out of 4 bad Nexus 7 can't be a coincidence. I advice anyone who purchases this Nexus 7 2nd gen to download ""dead pixel test"" from the PlayStore and check.

Went to BestBuy, bought one, and immediately opened it there. Tried to power it on but no luck. The notification light blinks 5 times and the screen stays off. Google ""five blinks of death"" for details. 15 min later after charging the tablet and still no luck, BB let me exchange it. Second unit powers on fine and I tested it for dead pixel. No dead pixels and everything looks good! I'm so happy but will still keep my rating at 2 so it stands out. Cheers."
B00DVFLJKQ,244,2438,Hard to beat.,Son of Thor,5,-,10-Sep-13,2,0,"I bought the first Nexus 7 for my wife when that first came out. It was a great tablet. I obtained this one for myself to use primarily for school to load electronic textbooks on. I love it. Fast, smooth. Battery life has been great so far. My favorite new feature is the indicator light.

The back facing camera works fine, honestly I'll never use it. Taking pictures with a tablet is ridiculous, who does that? It is useful for video chatting in some instances, but why not just put a high resolution camera on the front for that? I was fine with the N7 only having a front facing camera.

The screen is fantastic and very sharp. It makes for very sharp text when reading. I like the new shape. This is one of the few tablets you can actually stick in the pocket of your pants if you need to. Just wide enough to sit in your hand.

Asus improved the sound with stereo speakers on either end of the device (top and bottom in portrait). They are sufficiently loud. Not stellar- not sure how usable they would be in a noisy atmosphere. At Just 8mm thick-not really complaining.
One of the greatest features of Nexus devices is the ease at which you can root them. However, if you plan on rooting it, do it as soon as you get it. When you unlock the bootloader it will completely erase everything on the device. Although stock android is great, I like to tinker with it. As the last N7 I got was for my wife, I promised I wouldn't mess with hers. :-) So game on for this one.

Only real complaint- Why, Google, will you not specify a micro-SD slot? I know you can get a short cable and mount a USB stick- that is a pain. I want to install more memory and forget about it. Stop jerking us around a just put a slot in it. Not that expensive of an add on.
I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a compact tablet. Inexpensive, seems to be well made. Just don't buy the 16GB model. You will regret not spending just a few more bucks to get twice the memory later."
B00DVFLJKQ,244,2439,"Better value than iPad, slightly better than Kindle Fire HD.",Alex,5,-,21-Jan-14,1,0,"I owned an original Kindle Fire, which I liked but was only really good for ebooks and videos.

I decided to upgrade to a modern tablet and was torn between the Nexus 7 and the Kindle Fire HD.

It was a tough choice. I love Amazon as a company and the two tablets are almost identical in price and hardware.

What made me choose the Nexus is the fact that it runs a pure version of Android. The Kindle Fire runs a modified version of android, which is ""Amazon Heavy"" but which almost everyone agrees is slightly inferior to pure android.

I think that the choice is really close, but the Nexus wins by a nose."
B00DVFLJKQ,244,2440,is with the terrible service from ASUS,Cassie,1,-,20-Nov-14,5,0,"Although the Nexus7 has received all sorts of plaudits in online reviews don't expect any help from ASUS if you get a problem with one. I have so far had two (the original unit and a store replacement) that didn't work properly (the first one the screen pixilated, the second one the charger connection didn't work).This was followed two repairs done by ASUS which have failed to solve problems with the microphone. I am now waiting for my 5th replacement/repair. The real problem, though, is with the terrible service from ASUS. I have received positively the worst service I have ever had with any product in my entire life - and I'm 69 years old. Hours on the basic service phone line, hours more to speak to a supervisor, a six-week long exchange of dozens of emails using ASUS's online ""escalation"" approach with someone who simply does not understand the English language. Repair turnaround times are advertised at 5 - 7 business days but actually take in excess of a month. The escalation process which promises responses within 48 hours takes 5 - 7 days to get a response and questions are never answered directly, if at all. Requests for my unit to be replaced with a new unit have been denied (not their policy). Even a request for a reconditioned replacement unit has been denied. I'd love to get my money back but that, of course, has been denied too. ASUS does not deserve to stay in business with this kind of customer aftercare. Unfortunately I am required to give a star rating before I can submit this review. Being unable to give it zero stars I reluctantly give it one star."

Great battery life, beautiful picture, quick responses, nice sounds system, and camera. The problem we ran into was the charging port slowly stopped being responsive. I cleaned it (nothing blocking it), and tried to tighten the port to help, but to no avail. So now it's a very nice paperweight.
The tablet was around 1 year old when it finally gave up. It was used about daily - with a keyboard for typing up notes."
B00DVFLJKQ,245,2442,Best tablet for price,Ian,5,-,21-Nov-13,-,0,"You can't beat this. I noticed a lot of one star reviews that had phrases like ""users report the GPS doesn't work."" First of all, if you're writing a review, you should try the product for yourself and not rely on word of mouth. That being said, I have had no problems with my GPS. The screen display is amazing... Clear and crisp picture. I have had it in a case and dropped it multiple times without any cracks or malfunctions, but I can't give an accurate review as to the durability without a case. I also own an iPad which I paid twice as much for, and I like the nexus much better. Operating android allows me to download emulators and other such apps without having to jailbreak anything.

Long story short, if you're in the market for a tablet I strongly recom!end the nexus 7. The combination of quality, function, and price can't be beat."

B00DVFLJKQ,245,2444,2015 buyers beware,Doug Whiteline,2,-,23-Nov-15,2,1,I would not purchase one of these again. I bought it when they first came out and its worked mostly okay since. Few months ago it just died on me and google / asus were less than helpful in trying to get it fixed. For anyone looking at buying one of these in 2015 beware. Do some reading on large batches of these randomly dying. Some seem to think its a flash memory issue and when you run into issues there isn't much help.
B00DVFLJKQ,245,2445,Best Bang For You Buck,L. M. Kuykendall,5,-,07-Aug-13,2,1,"I purchased this tablet at my work a few days ago during the tax free weekend back to school promotion, and was also able to get an additional 15% off with my employee discount. Which in total got me this beautiful 32GB tablet for a mere $232.00 A GREAT deal for a tablet that launched a little over a week ago. Anyway, let me get down to the details. Sporting a Full HD 1080p display on a 7 inch screen, the level of detail in this tablet is stunning. I also own the Asus Transformer Infinity TF700 tablet. Which launched around this time last year and also has a Full HD 1080p display. However, even though they are a match resolution wise, and both manufactured by the same company (Asus). This tablet seems to have even better detail. This is likely from the fact that this tablet has a higher ppi and is crammed down into a 7 inch display. It has 2GB of ram, which for a tablet right now anyway is very good. Should be able to handle multi-tasking very well. There is very little used up space from the OS and pre-installed apps, so you still have a solid 28GB of storage space to work with out of the box. The build feels very solid and durable, I feel like even if I dropped this thing accidently it would take a substantial drop to crack or shatter the screen. The learning curve is virtually non-existant, play around with it for a few hours and you'll pretty much figure out everything it can do.

Bottom line, for the price...you cannot find a better tablet. This tablet costs $150 less than the iPad mini and is a WAY better tablet all around. I hate that so many people are so fixated on Apple products sometimes. I had a customer that was displeased that I didn't carry any Apple products at my store. I offered some of my other tablet devices including this one and explained it in full detail and that it is leaps and bounds ahead of the iPad Mini and she still said. Well,..thank you but I still think I'd rather have the iPad Mini. I told her the price difference and she still told me that she trusts Apple products more and believe that they were more reliable. The deciding factor here, she'd never heard of Asus before and didn't want to buy a product from a company she wasn't familiar with. She also said, I thought Acer weren't that great anyway so I'll pass. Another mistake, she was mistaking Acer for Asus, an unfortunate and common confusion between the two. I told her that Asus was actually number one in reliability on tablet/laptop consumer reports, even 5 places above Apple. She still said she'd rather have the iPad Mini, so I let her leave.

Folks, don't throw your money away. Apple does make some great products, but they no where near warrant the price they ask for their devices. Go with the sure thing, and get this tablet. You will not be disappointed."
B00DVFLJKQ,245,2446,Overall amazing tablet.,Franco Selem,5,-,07-Apr-14,4,0,"I would first like to start off by saying this is a generally, all around excellent tablet. It's absolutely phenomenal for reading books and PDF documents. The high-definition display allows you to see the text so clearly. It's also great for streaming music and video.

I've tried so many flavors of Android in the past, however, none seem to match up to stock Android. It's truly a brilliantly designed operating syatem. It's widely expendable from unknown sources (which can be a bad thing if you aren't careful) allowing you to get the most out of Android.

The camera on the Nexus 7 isn't so brilliant, however. In comparison to what some smartphone manufacturers are creating nowadays, it's (generously) a mediocre camera (this applies to both front and back facing cameras).

Summary: If you're looking for an awesome, smooth, sexy and fast tablet with a brilliant display and operating system and a mediocre camera, then this is the tablet for you. I should also mention it's only $215 USD."
B00DVFLJKQ,245,2447,Terrible customer service and a broken charging port.,James D. Jones,1,-,13-Jan-15,-,2,"I purchased this tablet in September and liked it. This thing is now a brick in January. When I bought it I thought it was odd that the battery charging port was loose. Well that is a major issue for this device and as I have now found out customer service is not ASUS strongest department. I called and was given a reference number. This is now an ongoing issue and I am awaiting resolution, but I am going to have to pay to send their defective product back to the factory to be altered so that it is functional . I am furious. The device is a true time thief in that I now have to invest my valuable time and effort into resolving the issue. I will black list ASUS and refuse to buy any of their products until they fix this. Terrible device, completely unacceptable customer service, and disgusting return policy. The website forces you to select a problem type and a problem code. When I enter in my problem type the problem code has no available drop downs to select from. You can not submit your problem with the tab blank. So, you can not submit your problem.

A stand up (landscape wireless dock” would be nice . I have found one on the internet , brand name KidDiGi i think is the correct spelling. The first generation had the landscape dock which works very well , contact type dock. This is a fine piece of hardware and should have the wireless landscape dock offering from the Play Store.

B00DVFLJKQ,245,2449,Great follow-up tablet to the original!,Angus66,5,-,31-Jul-13,1,0,"I own (or have owned) seven Android tablets over the past two years (Original Transformer 10.1"", original Kindle Fire, Samsung Tab 2 7"", Acer A700 full HD 10"" and 16 & 32 GB versions of the 1st generation Nexus 7), with five of them being 7"" in size. This tablet is easily the best of the bunch, but not for any one standout feature or spec. This tablet exceeds at doing many small, seemingly unimportant things better than competing devices.

First off the new N7 is narrower (in portrait orientation) and lighter than it's predecessor - I could feel and see this immediately when handling the two one after the other. As with most Android tablets it is expected to be held in landscape most of the time, and even with my larger than average hands the the new N7 was comfortable to use with little to no unintentional input on the touch screen.

Speaking of the screen/display, the new N7 is the nicest I've seen on a 7"" tablet.
It's very bright and clear with sharp text and crisp images. Is it ten times better than the original Nexus 7? No, but the original N7 has/had a very good screen and the new one is even better. The only small tablet screen (that I have personally seen) that is compatible would be the AMOLED display used in the Samsung & Toshiba 7.7"" tablets.

As far as processing speed and horsepower goes, the new N7 is faster & smoother than the original. I tested this by comparing a one week old 1st gen 32GB N7 to the new 32GB model with all the same Apps loaded and/or running. The original is/was fast, and the new N7 is even faster. Not much else to say except that YMMV depending on the apps you install and how the tablet is used.

WiFi speed and signal strength were the same as other tablets in our household when checked using Speed Test and WiFi analyzer apps. I only have a 2.4 GHz router though, so I am unable to test anything other than 2.4 GHz speed.

Other small changes and/or additions I appreciate are the notification light and the expanded account control abilities. Both are seemingly small things that greatly increase the usefulness of the device in my opinion.

Overall I really like the new Nexus 7 - I would easily suggest this tablet be in the top two or three choices if you are in the market for a 7"" tablet.

I will add to this review as I spend more time using the next Nexus 7"".

UPDATE 08/05/13: I've been using this tablet for over a week now and it's still as impressive as it was on day one. My wife kept wanting to borrow mine so often that I ended up purchasing one (16 GB version) for her as well. I have also purchased this LG Electronics WCP-300 Wireless Charging Pad for her tablet and so far it works great."
B00DVFLJKQ,245,2450,Awesome Tablet,Sparky San Diego,4,-,01-Aug-14,1,0,"I have owned the Apple Ipad and love this just as much.

The screen is wonderful for watching Netflix or any other media. The sound is adequate. The battery life is also adequaate. I get roughly 6 hours of use on a full charge.

For those wanting a tablet but not wanting to spend $4-500, this is the perfect solution. Grab the MiniSuite Keybiard Stand Case also. Really adds to the experience."
B00DVFLJKQ,246,2451,"A Tentative Decision, but a Happy Me",Tony,5,-,30-Dec-13,2,0,"I've had a kindle for awhile; just books, nothing else. I'd been thinking about upgrading to a tablet, but was hesitant because I thought I'd never use it. But I started looking anyway, and narrowed it down to this one and the Kindle Fire HDX. Now I have a macbook pro, an iPod, and a droid phone. So I really have no bias on iOS or Android; they both have their moments. But with the solid specs of these two tablets, I didn't want to shell out the extra dough for an iPad mini with basically the same specs. Plus, I knew I'd want customization and widgets on my tablet, and iOS simply doesn't like that &#55357;&#56860; Anyway...I ended up choosing the Nexus because I liked the customization options of stock android, and I didn't want to commit to amazon prime (which I would want to use the kindle hdx to its fullest extent.)

I love this thing. I've had it for about a week now, and its just awesome. First of all, it's beautiful. The screen is amazing. I didn't expect to see a big difference between this and my relatively-new phone, but I was pleasantly surprised. Like some have said, you've just got to see it.
I am using this thing quite a bit, for stuff all across the board. Its great for reading (my kindle hasn't gotten much use) and I can hold it in one hand quite easily. Its also great for videos (I've used YouTube, Netflix, and HBO GO with no problems.) I've also been using it for news. Google newsstand is good, but I downloaded flipboard and love it. Gaming is great too.
Overall I am incredibly pleased with this little guy, and though I was hesitant about getting a tablet, I am happy with my decision.
If you're on the fence about getting a tablet, and half a couple hundred dollars to spend, I would suggest giving the nexus 7 a try (I got the 32 GB, but we'll see if I'll actually need the extra storage. For only $40 more, what the heck, right?) . Even if I had a larger budget, I think I still would've gone with this tablet. IMHO, apples a great company with solid products, but they have to stop acting like they still own the tablet game. I think they should lower their prices to be realistic with their competitors. But they have a very loyal fan base who will buy anything just because its apple ( which is totally fine, more power to them) but this was a choice that I'd make again and again, no regrets."

It's a high quality leather case and the keyboard works great (and it's only $20!).

If you're an Android phone/tablet user, you'll get exactly what you're familiar with. If you like Apple, switch to this tablet and take the time to learn the Android operating system. You'll find you can do so much more with this tablet than an iPad!

The only con is that there is no USB port (only a micro-USB port) and no SD/micro SD card ports. However, if you root your tablet, you can program it to recognize a USB through a micro-USB to USB adapter."
B00DVFLJKQ,246,2454,Review from the heart.,teitatwo22,5,-,08-Dec-13,3,0,"After a long period of reviewing this tablet, and having owned a defective model from 2012, seeing all the very poor reviews and having experienced many negative things that I won't mention here about Google customer service, I decided not to gamble with this device. Yet something about the tech guys on YouTube changed my mind, their insistence that despite the poor quality of some of the devices, it is truly a winner. I tried to get a deal on Amazon but they didn't have any when I looked so I purchased from a competitor, which quite frankly was a frightening experience simply because I don't use any other online shopping and I have always had a great experience with Amazon. The other store was far slower than Amazon but still got it to my door. It truly felt like gambling when I unboxed it and booted it up, will I win or lose? So far a win... big win! I own the ipad mini, iPod touch 5th Gen, and several other top end models, I really like this tablet, yes it has some of the little niggling quirks of the Android os but is as fast and fluid as my iPad and iPod,.... In it's Android sort of way, meaning some apps still make it hicough, or crash but not as many as before. I honestly think that this device feels better than my mini, and the screen is truly, truly, truly masterful! The device looks like a dark chocolate bar with a screen, beautiful! Just don't try to eat it. I have found that it is a very special little tablet and can highly recommend it, but like a lot of electronics these days, they are not all created equal so buy from a reputable company and be willing to ship it back or better yet buy this one from a brick and mortar, so you can exchange it for a good one,..

Everything my original Nexus 7 did, the 2013 version does better. The new HD screen is just beautiful. The rear camera while not great, is still very useful and takes decent pictures. The Snapdragon Processor is much faster than the Tegra 3 Processor inside the original N7 uses. Battery life seems very similar between the 2 tablets. The 2013 Nexus 7 is in my opinion the best 7"" tablet there is. I have no regrets buying it even though I already own the original."

B00DVFLJKQ,246,2457,Battery issues like everyone else. Stopped working.,Anne S.,1,-,20-Jan-14,6,0,"I chose the Google Nexus 7 tablet because I trusted the Google brand, the price was right, and the reviews looked positive.
I had a friend who had bought one in late 2012 and had various problems with his, but figured his was a lemon.
Nope, the problems are pretty widespread, it seems. If you do a quick search online you'll see that I'm not the only person with ongoing issues with charging. The problems started when the charger stopped working. I would plug it in and nothing would happen. This caused the battery to completely drain out, which then messed up the system somehow. I checked with Google support to do a ""hard"" reboot and that started it up, but the charger still only actually worked about 1/3 of the time. That slowly turned into about 5%--and I noticed that it would lose power even when it showed it was charging, so something else was wrong. It would be plugged in, show the ""charging"" signal, but I could sit there and watch it lose power a percentage point at a time. At this point I thought maybe the charger was broken, and I bought a new one on Amazon. This one didn't work any better.
Google said it wasn't covered by warranty and I should refer to the store where I bought it. The store said I needed to contact ASIS. I had a hell of a time getting in touch with Asis, who then said that I had voided the warranty by using this second charger and not just the charger that came with the device.
Man, oh man.
So, my Google Nexus has been sitting on my shelf, ""charging"" for several weeks now, but will only occasionally turn on just long enough for it to ask me to plug in my charger and then shut itself off.
I do not recommend the Google Nexus. Better to spend a little bit more and get a product from a company with a proven history of quality and customer service."

B00DVFLJKQ,246,2459,Just not as easy to use as an iPad,Review Man,4,-,01-Nov-13,1,0,"I thought this was good until I got an iPad through work. Comparing the two you can really see a difference:

PROS: It has a great screen; Very thin, very light, very easy to hold and grip in one hand, yet it still feels solidly built; if you've bought into the Google universe, services like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc. are all fully integrated with accompanying voice commands; fairly accurate voice recognition; good battery life; tons of apps to choose from; front and rear cameras; mini-USB so no special wires or adapters; tough (I dropped it off my couch onto a wood floor with no ill effects); wireless charging.

CONS: It's SLOW; the touchscreen is much trickier to use than an iPad's - you wind up tapping multiple times to get it to do anything; if you're not fully invested in the Google universe of services then you miss out on some of the best functionality; no memory card slot; the rear 5MP camera isn't very good and gets grainy in low light; the volume rocker switch is close to the power button and a few times I've accidentally put the tablet into rest mode when trying to change the volume; it takes a long time to charge the battery; the auto-dimmer feature leaves the screen too dark. If you're not careful the mini-USB connector will break pretty easily, which is when wireless charging helps a lot.

Unfortunately I put it my back pocket one day, and the applied some pressure, so the screen is cracked & non-responsive. Thankfully the on the go cable allows me to use a mouse to navigate and use it normally.

Pretty much all the pros a cons have been covered in other reviews sad to say it seems to boil down whether you get a good one or not that is a troubling QC issue with Asus. My biggest concern is the real problem with the GPS the touch screen also has some issues but I find with using a stylus the screen responds better than with fingers. I have a Chromecast and a Roku with the Roku app the tablet works as an all in one remote for streaming to a TV. The display which was the hook for me buying is indeed beautiful and the processor speed/battery life are pluses. Google needs to fix the GPS problem ASAP and tweaking the touch sensitivity would be nice get this done and the tablet would easily be a five star exceptional value.

PS Found some buggy apps especially Netflix removing and re-installing them seems to have cleared up problems."

Lee,4,-,04-Sep-13,1,0,"This is an excellent tablet...especially for the price! The screen is sharp and great, as the resolution is a fantastic 1920x1200. The sharpness of the text stands out and it puts my Galaxy S3 to shame! The shape the Nexus is reminiscent of a large phone (i.e., narrower and taller than most tablets) but nothing so out of the norm that it would make you hate its appearance. It also comes with Android 4.3, the latest version available and, since it's a Nexus device, all future updates will come directly from Google. I purchased the 32GB version locally. A 16GB version is available, but there is no microSD card slot so spending about $40 more to double the onboard storage seemed like an easy choice to make.

As this is a second generation tablet, there are some improvements of note when compared to last year's version. These include: better screen resolution, a rear camera (it's only 5MP, but it's better than not having one), dual rear speakers, LED notification light (the color is white only), wireless charging (although you'll have to buy one of these chargers on your own), and the ability to mirror the screen to a TV or monitor through either an HDMI cable (via a Slimport adapter) or Miracast (wireless).

On the negative side, you may have read on the internet about various issues that some people have found with their tablets. A number of problems have been reported and one of which affected mine (single-touches weren't being consistently registered at the top of the screen in portrait mode if the tablet wasn't being held by me or being charged). A subsequent software update solved the problem for me (along with me determining that a screen protector was reducing the screen's sensitivity). Others who have reported problems have had mixed results after the update.

Google contracts with manufacturers to design and produce Nexus products at a subsidized price point, and in this case, it's Asus. The history of Nexus products has shown that initial quality control is ""ok"". Although this is my first Nexus device, I knew this going in and bought locally on the first day anyway. More than likely, many of these ""opening day"" issues will probably be ironed out as new batches are shipped. Just be sure that once you get your tablet, test the touchscreen for any issues as that is the problem that is most reported. Again, the great thing about a Nexus device is that if any problems can be solved by a software update, it will come directly from Google, not the hardware manufacturer.

This isn't to suggest that you'll run into a problem as most people haven't. The Nexus 7 is a great product for the price and functionality. Just make sure you have one that works as it should...and enjoy your new tablet!"
B00DVFLJKQ,247,2464,great value for money,Objective,3,-,29-Aug-13,1,0,"Update 10 Mar 2013

Sorry but I have to downgrade this to 3 stars because as of the turn of the year, the top part of the screen lost its touch sensitivity. This means no access to the swipe down from top. Disappointing quality control. Perhaps when trying to drive prices down, they used a less durable touch module. My mother used to say, you get what you pay for and I think she's right on this.

Update 13 Nov 2013

I'm upgrading this to 5 stars. Having had some time with the Nexus, I find myself using it more and more, mostly for reading and watching videos. The screen is really easy on the eyes and the software upgrade to Android 4.3 has made it smoother and faster. Asus has also come up with a really nice cover, which makes it look very professional. For this price, you are getting one of the best 7 inch tablets out there.

Pros:
Great screen
Very fast Wi-Fi (not enough reviewers mention this but I got 100 Mbps on my fibre off a ea3500 router. Not even the plug ins can match this!)
Light n slim
Can download stuff direct (as opposed to the iPad)
Can read almost all formats (compared to the iPad)
Very very good value (compared to the iPad)

Cons:
The screen smudges v easily (relative to a touchscreen phone or iPad)
No good covers yet
A little too small to read PDFs
Not as smooth in scrolling and enlarging as my htc one"
B00DVFLJKQ,247,2465,don't understand the negative reviews,thrifty shopper,5,-,24-Mar-14,1,0,"Bought this for Christmas for my 6 year old. Bought the 32gb. I ""tested it"" for 2 months before wrapping it and putting it under the tree. Plenty of storage space. The battery with light use last a week, Heavy use 2 days. I am very impressed with this device. Benchmarks higher than my Galaxy S4. This thing is amazing...and for those of you who said you should have got the ipad mini every review I have seen for this rates it higher than the ipad mini and air. I am looking to buy 2 more. It belongs to a 6 year old and is still flawless."
B00DVFLJKQ,247,2466,Cheap but Good,fair review,5,-,27-Aug-14,-,0,"The 2013 Nexus 7 has been impressive. The battery life will last a whole day for me even with constant use. The monitor is suitable for watching videos, particularly on HD sources. The OS appears to be Google's latest, and really works very well. The tablet is light and easy to bring along, which is half the battle (as anyone who lugs around its heavier counterparts can probably understand). Wifi and Bluetooth work flawlessly, and the processor seems to be very fast. I bought a refurbished unit and there has been no issues -- making it an even more cost effective deal."
B00DVFLJKQ,247,2467,Battery issues...again and again,clv,1,-,20-May-14,2,1,"This tablet has some kind of design flaw either with the battery charging connections, the charging cable or the battery itself. About one month after purchase and very light use, the battery began to drain very quickly. I followed all the instructions to reset, recharge, etc. as instructed on the Asus website. Still no charge. This is a very annoying problem. Sometimes the battery will charge if left plugged in for HOURS. Still, if you unplug it and use it, the tablet's battery is dead in less than 15 minutes. Ridiculous."
B00DVFLJKQ,247,2468,Charging a problem,diane kirkham,3,-,20-Feb-14,3,1,"I like everything about this tablet except the power cord. I am on my third one in a year. I buy the ones recommended for this particular unit, not a universal one. After a short period of time, ( 2 months on average), the connection is too loose to charge You have to move the cord around and hope to find a position in which it will make a connection. As I said, I am on my third charging cord. Having said that, the tablet itself is very good. Had one issue with internet connectivity, contacted support, received a prompt reply and through a series of emails, I was able to correct the problem. So as to performance of the tablet itself, I give it high marks. The problem with the power cord negates all that however and is the reason I will be ordering a new and different product. For me, I would stay away from both the 7"" and 10""."
B00DVFLJKQ,247,2469,Decent Tablet but I'm hesitant to recommend it to anyone at this time,PepperPot,3,-,28-Aug-13,12,2,"As of today my Nexus 7 does not work because I dropped it this morning and the screen cracked. I'll consider purchasing another Nexus 7, but that won't happen until I'm comfortable Google has worked out the kinks in Android 4.3 as well as the other software issues that appear to be a common theme amongst the reviews.

I received this tablet on 8/2 and it's been 50% good/50% frustrating. I like the following:

Screen: The clarity is excellent. I did not have an opportunity to read books on it but I downloaded a S. King book preview to get a feel for reading on the Nexus and it was fine. I have also been browsing the web regularly and I have no issues reading.

Form factor: This is the main reason I purchased a 7 inch tablet. It fits in my back pocket and my Blazer/Suit jacket which allows me to be hands free and it's not cumbersome when I'm holding it. I commute to work on the train and theft is a concern. I can conceal this better than a larger tablet. My only wish is that it were 1-2 inches shorter. On the other hand, this screen size is about 5 15/16. I'm sure ASUS could have added 1/4 of an inch more to the screen in this current size.

Performance: Smooth (when it performs). Personally, I didn't experience any touch screen issues or drops in my wifi signal and I don't use netflix. Everything from playing games to accessing applications worked fine.

Battery Life: The battery life has been good, but I don't use it consistently throughout the day. Generally if I leave the house on a full charge in the morning and I use it periodically (web browsing, gaming) it's still running a 60% charge by the time I'm home. Standby has been solid as well. It might only drop a percentage or two on standby.

What I have not liked:
The software has been a nuisance. ASUS gets a pass on this.

I've done 5 factory resets since I purchased it. The first reset, which occurred within a week of ownership, was due to the following error - ""Unfortunately, the process com.google.process.gapps has stopped"". This error occurs when Google apps fail to sync. One fix is to access the Google apps (settings) -> unhcheck automatic sync(for all apps) -> restart. But, the prompt error message prevents you from accessing the settings so I had to reset. See directly below for an alternative way to access the settings that I found recently.

Spontaneous resets and sleep mode: This has not been a constant issue. It came up two days ago while I was in the Google play store and after when I was playing a game. It was followed by another sync error message like the one I mentioned above. I did not want to do another factory reset. So Instead of trying to cancel the error message, I hit the ""send report"" option repeatedly. That gives you a short opportunity to access the settings to disable automatic sync.

Start-up problems: This happened one morning after I charged the Nexus. The tablet failed to boot into the OS. It stayed on the Google logo screen throughout the morning so I performed a 4th factory reset.

Google Maps: Loss of the GPS signal was the least of my issues. Loosing my mind trying to figure this out was. I have a prepaid phone. I can't tether my tablet to the phone. Google maps offers offline navigation, BUT you have to download the map. I didn't see an option to download a map based on directions. What it downloads is a map that is not even a mile from your position. When you drive outside that area you no longer have access to the map unless you access the internet to download again. It doesn't make sense. On a recent trip from Atlanta to New York we made a couple of stops where wifi was available. I accessed the map to get directions. I was testing it to see if the tablet would continue to navigate offline using the GPS, but it dropped the directions when the tablet went into sleep mode. It will also drop the directions if you access another program. I wouldn't recommend this as a GPS unless you have unlimited access to the web. I also have little confidence a constant GPS signal will address these issues.

Finally, last night I received a message prompting me to update Android 4.3. I think this update is the patch that addresses the multi-touch and GPS issues. I went ahead and updated. 5 minutes later I noticed the tablet was stuck on the Google logo screen. That was around 7:30 pm. When I woke up this morning it was still on the same screen. I restarted, it went back to the logo screen and would go no further. At that time I decided to do another factory reset.

A few people have asked me about this tablet because they are in the market for a first or second tablet. One person I work with has an Ipad. She is looking for a cheaper tablet for her son. I would recommended the Nexus to her but I can't without mentioning the software issues. Most people don't have the patience for these issues and they don't want to put in the due diligence to fix them.

This could easily be a five star tablet but current software issues makes it average."
B00DVFLJKQ,247,2470,Best deal in tablets,Jeff,5,-,21-Aug-13,1,0,"I upgraded from the original Asus Transformer TF101 to the new Nexus 7. So far I have been extremely impressed with this device and will try to list some of my thoughts on it below:

PROS:
- beautiful display and resolution, everything from games to text looks incredible. I was worried about moving from a 10"" tablet to the 7"", but I absolutely love it and find it a more usable form factor for me. 10"" tablets just felt a bit too awkward, and too big/wide/heavy for long term single hand use.

- This 7"" is about perfect for me, it is extremely lightweight and thin, great ergonomics, and generally a pleasure to use. Before I found myself barely ever using my tablet, but now I find myself using it quite a bit and it is just a much more enjoyable experience.

- Performance blows my old tablet and my current phone away, everything is perfectly smooth and responsive. Apps open up very quickly. All the tech I want is there including bluetooth and NFC etc. Stereo speakers have really good volume and sound pretty good considering.

- Latest version of Android is very nice, many great improvements over my old tablet

- IMO there is no better tablet on the market, certainly not one remotely close to this price point. You simply can't beat this Nexus 7 for $230/270.

CONS:
- not much to say here, about the only thing I wouldn't mind having might be an SD card slot. But with that said, I had an additional 32GB SD card in my old tablet and never even really had a use for it. I think I'll be fine with the internal 32GB"
B00DVFLJKQ,248,2471,Google Nexus 7 - 32GB,Alex,5,-,02-Nov-13,2,0,"First off, I just want to say that I LOVE this tablet. It's my first tablet, and I have been extremely satisfied with it.

I am a Mechanical Engineering student at a technical school, and I use my tablet daily for productivity, note taking, and entertainment consumption. I use it to take notes in some of my classes, and it acts as my organizer, calendar, and tasks-list.

First, I'll start with the cons, and save the best for last:
-I pre-ordered my first Nexus 7, and it crapped out in about two weeks. I think I just got a lemon, as I have not had any issues with my current tablet. Not necessarily a con, but worth noting.
-Not as ""snappy"" as an iPad, but that is just because Android is an open-ended system. I MUCH prefer Android over Apple, however, that is just my preference. I have not really had to many latency related issues with this tablet. All of the other android devices that I've used have had issues freezing up or randomly shutting off, but nothing of the sort has happen with this tablet...built I digress...
-Camera isn't the best, but I don't really think a tablet camera is that usable anyway.

Pros:
-I love the HD screen. It's very clear, and great for reading and watching videos, as well as playing games.
-Speakers are AWESOME. Not a lot of base...but if one of your biggest demands from a tablet is heavy base, you might want to rethink your purchase, or get some good speakers or headphones. :P
-So easy to use; great touch response, well though-out control and volume-rocker placement, and so many other things make it so effortless to use, unlike lots of other tablets on the market. This is such a balanced piece of equipment.

There are so many other great things about this tablet, but the best way to find out is to go get one! After using other seven inch tablets, including the iPad mini, I honestly think this thing is unbeatable for the money."

I'm hoping Google will fix these defects in the near future, but I also wish that all of us consumers would take notice in these problems and speak out, so these issues are not shrugged off.

Please, just take the time to test out your nexus 7. Go to Google play store and download Yet Another Multi Touch Test.
Run one finger down and around the screen and see if you notice anything unusual.(Portrait and Landscape Mode)
I tried 3 different tablets and they were all having Ghost/Phantom touch issue ( a second touch is registered without you touching the screen).

Another thing you can test is Play anything that has sound, i.e. a YouTube video. Adjust your volume to about 20 to 30%, and see if you hear any static distortion.
As far as i learned most if not all nexus 7 2013 are plagued with this issue.

It is not my intention to bash the nexus 7 2013, I think it could be an awesome tablet. I just hope that there would be enough people to speak out to get Google to fix these issues.

Fernatt,5,-,23-Oct-13,1,0,"I've had my Nexus 7 for about a month now and have been very impressed with the quality of the screen and the overall speed and responsiveness of the unit. Even when running multiple apps, switching between them, playing music, etc. at the same time it works seamlessly. I also have an Asus Transformer Prime 10"" tablet with the dock and there is no comparison in the levels of performance. I still like the Transformer for its keyboard/dock solution, but it's about 2 years old now and its performance shows it. Battery life on the Nexus has been good, GPS has worked fine for me, wireless performance is very good (especially compared with the Transformer), etc.

I also picked up a Moko case for it and they work very well together. The speakers are great on the unit as is, but the case enhances the audio even more.

If I had to nitpick, I'd say a microSD slot would have been a solid addition and I wish there was a way to do native mini HDMI without an adapter. But, considering the price and what you get (excellent screen and great performance) these are minor nits."

The tipping point was when Nexus 7 did a factory reset when I switched to a Camera mode. Be aware that when you use video calls feature while Skyping people cannot see you because the front camera does not work. Apparently, it is Skype software glitch related to Nexus 7 rather than the other way around but it does not make any difference for the users. You cannot install HBO GO app (and bunch of other great apps) on Nexus 7 either due to incompatibility.

With limited testing it appears some of my complaints have been addressed. I will test over the next week or so and adjust my review accordingly. **

Where to start..... I love this tablet yet hate it. This thing has so much potential and I want it to succeed so bad but Google is a long way away from earning my praises. Let's jump right into my review.

Screen (5/5): Gorgeous. It is bright and clear. I could not ask for more and it did not disappoint. No dead pixels or multi touch issue for me. Note: Some users are reporting defective screens registering multiple taps.

Size / Look & Feel (4/5): Almost perfect. I wish the bezels were just a bit smaller, but they do serve a purpose. Overall it is easy to hold and feels well built. The backing is a little slippery and it has a soft texture to it (if you ever had a kindle keyboard you know what I mean).

Performance (Gaming, Videos, Media) (5/5): Once again this tablet met all expectation. This is by far the best mobile experience I have had when it comes to enjoying ebooks, magazine, internet, videos, and games.

Performance (GPS & Offline Maps) (0/5): Awful and unacceptable. I am a pilot and I (along with many others) bought this item to use with an offline GPS aviation app. Sometimes it appears to work (mainly if you are standing still near a wifi network). But as soon as you start moving the GPS will drop and never reacquire without a hard reset. Google is aware of the issue but have yet to issue an official statement almost 1 month later. Unacceptable. If they are wanting to compete with the Ipad mini they will be loosing business in the aviation industry for sure if they don't address this.

Google Customer Service (0/5): Non existent. One google employee has been quoted as saying they are looking into it. Almost a month later not one additional detail. No one knows if this is hardware or software related. Upon calling Google I was informed that the GPS is not designed to work without being in WiFi range. Really? Would I really need a GPS if I was near a Wi-Fi hot spot? Once again unacceptable.

If anyone thinks this is just me with a bad device Google ""Nexus 2013 GPS Issue"". You will see many forums blowing up about this. I personally am on my second device and this one is just as bad as the first one.

As it stands right now I can't recommend this device for anyone wanting to use this for some form of reliable navigation. I'm highly disappointed. If Google would come out and let us know wants going on I would be patient and understanding. However their complete lack of communication is, in my opinion, extremely disrespectful to their consumer."

Also, I didn't like the on and off button. It's kind of difficult to press because it seems to be a little ""retracted"". In other hand, once you hit the button is very fast to turn it on and load all the apps.

So the Nexus got RMA'd. They sent back the same unit, claiming to have fixed the issue. I asked my relative to test it for me, seeing as I may have to return it again if it isn't fixed. She did. Issues remained. New RMA created. Sent back to ASUS.

Obviously I wasn't happy. However, ASUS did cover the shipping cost for returning the unit the second time around. That put me at ease. At least they care about my business.

RMA came back, they gave me a new unit, and I'm happy to say it's working great! I updated it to Lollipop and everything is good. Changing my review to 4 stars. Not perfect given the QC issues ASUS has when building these.

----------Original Review----------

So I just bought the Nexus 7 about a week ago at Best Buy. Seeing as I don't live in the States, I took the opportunity to have a relative import one for me. I would've thought twice about this decision after I started using it...

So, the tablet itself is great. Stereo speakers, great screen, nice, solid build quality... or so I thought. The Nexus came with Android 4.3 pre-installed. Many of the issues I started seeing with the screen I thought would be issues with the Android version it was running. Needless to say, I immediately downloaded Android 4.4.2. Not only were the screen issues not resolved, but the touch issues got worse. Multiple touches being detected on the screen make it IMPOSSIBLE to use. You browse through a site, it clicks a link that you didn't intend to click; you read a book, the screen goes crazy when flipping pages cause it detects multiple touches; you try to pinch-to-zoom, all sorts of wacky things start happening.

Needless to say, I'm pissed. I live in a country where the Nexus is not sold, and I can't take a plane and return it to Best Buy. A relative is flying to the States next month and will be RMA'ing this ASAP. Asus better replace it, or I just flushed $250 down the toilet.

Why did I give it two stars? Well cause the tablet itself is awesome... if you're lucky to get a decent unit.

I wouldn't recommend importing one. If you do, make sure you fully test touch screen sensitivity and build quality before you get on a plane back home."

There are lots of forums out there with lots of techno-babble on how to sideload Flash Player, but Amazon has an app which makes it easy. See: B00ELD3MUW

I almost didn't get the Nexus 7 because of all the negative reviews and problems reported. I commute for upwards of 4 hours at times and wanted a small device with which I could do some light work, view/edit MS Office files, etc., without having to unsheathe my laptop.
I decided to take the plunge and try it out.

I ran all updates as soon as I registered the device. That took a little while since there as an OS update and all the installed software was also updated.
Once that was done I plugged it into a USB port on my desktop and started installing my apps.
After about 15 minutes I noticed that the device was still losing power. After checking connections and rebooting, I did the unthinkable...I read the first few pages of the manual. The manual says that the system requires more power than a USB port is able to provide if your using it. It will charge normally if the Nexus is in sleep mode.
After that I moved to the couch and plugged into the wall. Charging proceeded normally.

I've only had the system for about 12 hours but have not experienced any issues to date.

I'll update this if I encounter any problems.

Cheers!"
B00DVFLJKQ,249,2487,Fantastic specs that mean NOTHING *facepalm*,Alexander Toth,1,-,23-Nov-13,40,2,"Where to start? I watched hours of reviews and compared the specs of a dozen or two tablets. I have been impressed with Google as of late and their product offering. I am slowly losing my taste for apple and since I have been using an Android phone since January, I decide to upgrade from an iPad 2 to the new Nexus 7. I log onto Amazon and place my order for a 2013 32GB Nexus 7... overnight shipping of course (I MUST have the tablet in hand tomorrow!).

Fast forward 24 hours and I open the Amazon box to see the Google Nexus box inside. I open the Nexus box and notice that the Nexus 7 is encased in plastic wrapping but there is dust and small particles all over the plastic. This was the very first thing that irked me. I unwrap the Nexus and immediately get excited by its form, weight and overall simple beauty. I charge the device fully and go to power it on. I am presented with the Welcome screen and then the ""Select Wifi Connection"" screen... but the device will not connect to my wifi. The one or two times it saves the connection, it immediately says the connection is not available. It simply will not progress further into the setup process. After an hour of rebooting my router, checking my admin settings and reading articles online, I decide to do a factory reset of the device. Yes, a factory reset on a device that is fresh out of the packaging and never set up.

I go through the process of restoring the Nexus to its factory settings and it worked! I was able to set up the Nexus and I am in heaven... or so I thought. Over the course of playing with the new device and in the matter of a couple of hours, I notice that the headphone jack does not work. No sound through the headphones... period. In fact, I could hear the stereo sound pouring out of the Nexus speakers while my headphones were plugged in. I'm not happy. It was all downhill from there. The device started rebooting all by itself. Each time I wonder if the OTA Kit Kat update had been installed and it rebooted because of an update. Nope.

Well to make a long story short, the Nexus rebooted 2-3 times on its own and then got stuck in an infinite loop of the Google screen flashing on and off. I attempted to restore the device to factory settings once more. It didn't work. It wouldn't move past the Google screen. It was charged. It was connected. It was put through several hard reboots. Finally, I get the Welcome screen again. I click the giant arrow and move to the Wifi Connection screen. Then the touch screen fails. No touch is registered on the screen period. After 2-3 seconds of tapping on the screen, the Nexus reboots by itself. It immediately goes to the Google screen and is stuck on the infinite loop of the Google logo flashing on and then off.

I log onto to Amazon, print off my return authorization and shipping label and now its in the hands of UPS. Now I sit here waiting for a refund without a tablet. I sold my iPad 2 in order to buy this Nexus 7. I'm so disappointed. I can't begin to tell you just how much."
B00DVFLJKQ,249,2488,Attention: ALL GPS PROBLEMS FIXXED!!!!,Mac,5,-,26-Aug-13,6,1,"First of I am writing this on my ns2, so ya. I baught this about a week after the launch and yes the one problem I HAD was the gps one. Google, being as great as they are, jumped on the problem right away. I am happy to say that the gps has been fixed! :) This tablet is amazing. Very fast, powerful, and gorgeous (both the screen and the outer shell). This thing is great for gamming, but does heat up a bit near the top. But i dont mind because: 1. I have a case. And 2. You cant blame it, because it has to process the game graphics for over 2.3 million pixles! The screen also makes it awesome for reading. Books or web look great on it. However, my favorite feature is by far the face lock. To unlock it when you turn it on its looks at your face and it recognizes that it you and unlocks the screen, which is very cool. I also love Google Now which is the Google version of Siri, but better. Does everything right, since the gps fix, and this price it is hands down the best tablet out there..."
B00DVFLJKQ,249,2489,Nexus 7 FHD Made Me Look (and Buy!),morjoie,5,-,24-Aug-13,4,0,"I watched the press conference announcing the new Nexus 7 (Nexus 7.2) and expected to be underwhelmed. But when the Google head honchos talked about the changes they made in 7.2, I was intrigued. After going to Office Depot, I was hooked and HAD to buy! The 5 star rating is probably a clue that I am glad I did. I had the original Nexus 7, and, contrary to reports, I never had the lag or slowdown issues that others experienced. I thought the screen was OK, not stunning, but certainly adequate. I especially liked the way that apps worked smoothly and the battery life. My primary intent was to use it as an e-reader, anyway.

But the display on 7.2 really IS stunning! That alone is reason enough to upgrade, especially at less than $270 (short supply appears to be inflating the sales price on Amazon - I would just wait for supply to be replenished and pay the list price of $269). Anyway, the display is brighter, the colors are richer. Looking at video content has leaped from ""passable"" to truly wonderful. Google/Asus didn't stop there, however. They made hardware improvements and expanded on-board RAM to 2gb to significantly improve graphics rendering and overall responsiveness to touch. Switching to a Snapdragon processor also seems to have helped as Nvidia's Tegra processor has become famous for causing performance hiccups. This tablet is so snappy, I am constantly surprised at how quickly apps open, how quickly they update and at the more efficient use of the battery. Playing games and using other apps has become a seamless experience. This is the first time I've seen actual evidence of Project Butter since the hullabaloo at Google I/O 2012. (I know Google is in the process of issuing an update to address GPS/touch issues for the Nexus 7.2, but I do not have those issues with my tablet, so my review is from that perspective.)

Some have complained about the elongated form factor, with the wider bezels at the top and bottom. I don't mind those, however. Overall, the tablet is very comfortable to hold and the larger bezels make watching a video while holding the tablet in landscape that much easier.

I think this is the best small tablet on the market, and is likely to remain so for quite some time. I hear Apple may announce a retina iPad Mini this fall, but Nexus 7.2 already has ""retina"" at 323p per inch. And it's not like iPad Mini will come close to matching the price point of $269, so even if the iPad Mini manages to match Nexus 7.2 in specs, Nexus 7.2 will still trump the iPad Mini on price point, if nothing else. Samsung is likely to announce a refresh of its premium 8in Galaxy Note tablet this fall, too. Not only is it likely that the Note will come in at a higher price, but Samsung will insist on imposing Touchwiz, their annoying system overlay. They won't be able to help themselves. Advantage, Google. Then, of course, Nexus 7.2 will be first in line for OS upgrades, like Key Lime Pie. Check and Mate - Nexus 7.2!

Now that I've waxed rhapsodic, in the interest of fairness, I must mention what I don't like - and it comes down to one word - STORAGE. I think Google should have offered a 64 gb version of this tablet. Google wants people to purchase content that, as it conveys more information, consumes increasingly more memory. We need storage to handle that. Many of us are not always near wi-fi hotspots, and even if we are, public wi-fi is notoriously insecure, so, I do not open my Google or other accounts on public wi-fi (the only way to stream video content I have purchased). I know downloading is an option, but that uses up (guess what) memory! Google and Apple share an antipathy toward sd cards and sd slots. Fine. Then offer the option of greater internal storage. Even the iPad Mini comes in a 64 gb version. I was really disappointed that Google chose not to offer this option. For some, no expandable storage will be a dealbreaker. It almost was for me.

Now that I'm thinking about it, a mini HDMI port would have been nice, too. It would have encouraged me to buy more Google video content that could have easily been shown on a large screen tv. It's nice that the Slimport usb port can be converted to an HDMI connector, but that requires another $30 or so for an adapter or $35 for Chromecast. Not a dealbreaker, just sayin'.

Bottom line: in spite of the criticisms I just mentioned, I must say this tablet is fabulous! I love using it. I'll put up with the storage issues because, on so many levels, this tablet does what it is supposed to do, with aplomb. Even if the 7.2 was priced at $350, it would be an excellent value. At $269, it is just irresistible. So, check it out, then buy it (before they run out of it again)."
B00DVFLJKQ,249,2490,Great device...if it worked!!,slayergabumon,2,-,26-Aug-13,3,0,"Sigh. So I waited a year for this newer model to come out. I splurged to get the 32GB model...then 4 days after setting it up, using it and loving it..it started to act up. It would not boot, ""launcher failure"". Then, yes..the repeat auto booting started occurring...forcing me to force wipe it clean only to then have the ghost typing introduced and the touchscreen completely be unresponsive. I literally could not manipulate (unlock via the screen) the tablet at all for about a day. When I finally got to the recovery screen again to wipe it and start over again..the wi-fi would never authenticate. Painful!! So so disappointed...I finally returned it, and ordered a Galaxy tab 3 8inch today. At least I know there have been no issues with that product so far since it's launch. I think a huge mistake by Google was releasing a product with a brand new OS that a large number of the apps do not yet support. That's probably a big factor with the software incompatibility behind the scenes. Hopefully Nexus 7 2014 will be better. Until then...Galaxy me up! Be warned folks..until you hear ALL the issues with this product have been fixed (the multi-presses, auto rebooting, GPS not working)..your nexus 2013 tablet is definitely affected (a carrier of bad code). When it acts up?..is just a matter of time. Its a software issue."
B00DVFLJKQ,250,2491,Mine didn't even last until it's 2nd birthday. Do Not Buy.,Mister B,1,-,08-May-15,7,0,"DO NOT BUY. I am the tech guru for my family friends. I bought this tablet in July 2013. Last night it became an expensive cutting board due to hardware failure. Neither Google nor Asus will do anything about it despite this becoming a common occurrence for hundreds of owners in the past few weeks. (see twitter hastag #Nexus7Bricked). Asus will however repair the device at a cost that nearly equals the original purchase priced.

I'm a huge Android fan, but I regret having purchased this device, and more so, recommended it to my friends and family who spent their hard-earned money on it."

B00DVFLJKQ,250,2493,HORRIBLE DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Amazon Customer,1,-,31-Mar-14,3,1,"I first ordered this device with high hopes. I loved the thought of getting the latest android updates first along with a high spec, low cost tablet. Well it worked in the software, the hardware however, was that of a ninety dollar tablet that you would pick up at the grocery store. The camera that ASUS put in there, was horrible. I would have preferred a gorilla glass screen, instead of the camera. That brings me to my next point, the screen. The description says ""scratch resistant screen"", but it is about as scratch resistant as a piece of wet clay. I bought a keyboard case and it put many scratches that were very visible. The keyboard was smooth plastic! One day I had a screen protector (because of the scratches) and a case on it, I picked it up and it cracked right in front of my eyes!!! I then called ASUS and they refused to fix it! That is unless I payed two hundred dollars. Why am I nagging on about asus, you ask? ASUS makes the hardware, Google held up with the software and delivered the promise of the Nexus branding. I would have been much happier buying the Nexus 10 manufactured by Samsung."

B00DVFLJKQ,250,2496,Best tablet for the price,Adam B.,5,-,12-Aug-13,1,2,"This tablet is very reasonably priced and offers performance and features that are unmatched in its price class, and, in some cases, in even more expensive tablets that are out there. Performance has been excellent, with a very responsive and accurate touch interface, a high density fully 1080p display, and a very long (10 hours of usage) battery life.

The only real drawback to it is that it doesn't have an SD slot to provide a long term ""storage expansion solution"".

Like any other full featured android tablet, you can download apps from the Google Play Store, or with very little work, the Amazon App Store. I've also been able to access the Humble Bundle apps, also with a little work.

If you are interested in a tablet this is, for most, the one to get."
B00DVFLJKQ,250,2497,Initial Comparison with Kindle Fire HD,J. Burgett,5,-,03-Aug-13,3,2,"I am a Kindle Fire HD fan. (so some of you should stop reading now) The new Nexus 7 really gives the Kindle Fire a run for its money as an entertainment device. I only have one Amazon movie, but use Hulu Plus and NetFlix. Both of those work great on both devices. Come to think of it, I didn't try viewing my Amazon Prime movie on the Nexus. My main use is web browsing, books, music and video files. The new Nexus has speakers that sound pretty much just as nice (and loud) as the KFHD. There might be a difference in screen resolution, but my eyes can't tell - both screens look bright and sharp.

Books - Text to speech on Amazon Kindle books only works on the KFHD. Since many, if not most of my books are Amazon, that is a bummer - I like text to speech for when I am driving and listening at bedtime. Audible's audiobooks works fine on both.

Web Browsing. Believe it or not, I side-loaded Chrome on my KFHD some time ago, but I really just use Silk. Silk is fine for my needs.

So both are fine devices, so what are the attractions to one over the other?
- Nexus 7 has my favorite Google apps - like Google Maps.
- Nexus 7 has GPS, which sounds useful, haven't played much with it yet.
- Nexus 7 allows multiple user accounts. That will really be handy.
- Nexus 7's back facing camera lets you take pictures even it you look funny doing it.
- Google Play store has a bajillion apps, 99.9997% of which I don't care about. But there are a half dozen I would like that aren't on Amazon's store.
- Kindle Fire's built-in ebook reader will display both Amazon and non-Amazon books and will do text to speech on them all.

I own both, but if I had pick just one today, I'd pick the Nexus 7. BUT, I noticed today that only the 16 gig version of the KFHD is for sale at Amazon. Perhaps Amazon is about to release a new version? Next month could be a different story.

There are minor details, like the Nexus needs a special adapter cable for HDMI out where the KFHD uses a separate, ""normal"" socket. And the Nexus buttons are tiny and I find myself fumbling to find them.

If you have an older model and are thinking of upgrading, perhaps waiting to see what Amazon responds to the Nexus 2013 with would be good. To be totally honest, I am now a fan of both tablets. And married to an iPod Touch fangirl who demands a unit she can slip into her pocket."
B00DVFLJKQ,250,2498,Google Nexus 7 Version 2,Ralph Furlong,3,-,18-Aug-13,10,0,"Having had an Amazon Fire HD and an Apple Ipad mini, I thought that maybe the Nexus 7 would be a great product that enhanced what features the other two had and add something more, like a great graphics screen. Here is what I found:

Things that I liked:

1. The unit was fast to configure and to update.

2. The graphics on the screen looked great and the video sample provided was terrific!

Here is what I did not like:

1. NO AMAZON PRIME VIDEO SUPPORT!! No app to support it and no web browser that will support it either. I did finally find a browser that would support playing an Amazon Prime video, but it was terrible! The video would freeze and be behind the audio track and no full screen! Google's answer was ""use our video service""! Amazon had no answer. What is so tuff here? There is an app for Apple, why not for Google Android?

2. Great concept having GPS, now if only it worked!! GPS failed right away and there is no fix for it. As an interesting point, this unit is made by ASUS, but they provide NO support for it!!!! Google does not provide any hardware support for this either!

3. One of the main reasons I wanted this, besides Amazon Prime video, was to be able to download pictures from my Nikon to work on. Carrying around a laptop is a real pain and I was able to do this with my Ipad with no issue so figured it should work with the Nexus. Well, guess again. The camera would connect, the Nexus would show me the pictures on my camera, but when you went to download them it would only download 4 to 10 pictures and then quit!! Google support was no help! Nikon was no help, and ASUS would not talk to me because they do not support this product!!!!!

4. The size of the unit is not very good for anything other than video!!! It is long and narrow. Makes reading a book on it a pain and working with any type of document a pain. If this fits in a pocket, you must have one heck of a pocket!! The screen is smaller than an Ipad mini and smaller than the Amazon Fire HD.

This may be a very good unit if you do nothing more than play games and use Google video service. However, it is NOT great for reading a book, watching video from someone other than Google, or for working with photography.

My suggestion if you need something this small is to wait for the new release of the Apple Ipad mini as it is supposed to have Retina display. Yes, it does cost a lot more, but then again, a inexpensive unit that does not function is not really much of a value.

PS, just so that you know, even though Google admits that their GPS does not work and that they do not support camera downloads or Amazon video or any type of FLASH support, they will NOT refund your money without taking out a 15% stocking fee and making you pay to return the item!!!!!!! When was the last time you bought an item that had a dead feature and you were made to pay to take it back?"

Top 7"" tablet out on the market right now. Do your self a favor, if your in the market for a tab, check this one out.

Have not dealt with any glitches or restarts, auto updates to latest version OS when powered on. With the 32GB I can download all the apps I want and still have plenty of room for music and assorted media files. And Walmart offers a 2 year warranty for 28$ that covers accidental damage.

I got the new Nexus 7 HD2013 32gig as soon as they came out. I had issues initially with the GPS not working and the touch input locking up/ typing oddly. Returned/ exchanged at Best Buy... Since then No more issues. Also noticed buttons were a little different - in a good way and performance was better overall... even the sound performance was better than the first one i got. My gut says the first ""batch"" or wave of New Nexus 7s had some rough edges.

Other than that it has performed flawlessly. I have even had multiple apps running at the same time.. no bugs or lags which I have seen with other tables of similar size.
Out of the box you will not be able to watch adobe flash videos - but the fix is pretty easy : [...] sorry for the long link but it shows you step by step how to add the plug in.. This was one of the deciding factors for me regarding waiting for the new kindle fire HD... I have amazon prime and I was initially peeved that I was not able to view the videos on my Nexus 7... but now those and all adobe flash work seamlessly.

Highly recommended. Its light, small to fit easily in purse, great performance and very user friendly... It comes with instruction manual/ quick start guide but I never read it... its pretty intuitive.

Oh last recommendation - get advanced task killer free... there is a paid version but there is no difference that I could see... anyhoo if you add the widget to your homescreen it is a quick way to close any lingering apps all at once.. You can also do that from the home screen to free up memory. I have not needed to do it for memory low or lagging performance... just saving time.

Hope this helps... racking my brain to think of any cons.... none"
B00DVFLJKQ,251,2501,EDITED : Google or Asus need to acknowledge the problems.,T. McDaniel,4,-,18-Aug-13,16,4,"Review EDIT:

I'll leave my original review below. I would like to point out that Google has released a new firmware that has corrected the GPS problem. The new firmware at this time is JSS15Q. The Nexus 7 overall is a very nice tablet and all I wanted was for it to work as advertised.
Had Google communicated to it's customers better, it would have been given 5 stars.

==============================================================================

The below comment was taken from Googles product forums where they choose to ignore their customers. Neither Asus or Google will acknowledge the problem with GPS openly. They prefer to insult you by telling you that GPS requires WiFi to work correctly. Anyone that has a standalone GPS knows this is not true. Anyone that owns any other tablet with GPS knows this is not true. Well unless you own an Asus prime. I understand GPS doesn't work on it either. For the record, GPS works off of satellite's, not WiFi.

The new Nexus 7 has a major defect out of the box: the GPS sensor which allows the tablet to be used for satellite navigation does NOT work. Almost everyone who has purchased the Nexus 7 and tried to use GPS for navigating has found the tablet cannot lock onto a signal. Google acknowledged this problem after release, but has yet to provide an update whether they think it can be patched (software) or not (hardware).

Many early adopters including myself have been mistakenly fed the same line by Google AND Asus tech support that""GPS does not work without wifi"". This is in stark contrast to the first generation Nexus 7, all Samsung Galaxy Tabs, and most recent smart phones which can access GPS for navigation WITHOUT any kind of wi-fi or cellular data connection.

If you are looking to buy this tablet, please be aware that the GPS will NOT work out of the box. More importantly, there is a strong possibility Google/Asus will deny the problem and not do anything about it."

I will never buy another asus product again. My original iPad still works 5 years later. Shame on asus for making a product that lasts for 1 year. Oh and thanks for breaking the screen when it was there. I will really enjoy replacing that while I am replacing the motherboard."
B00DVFLJKQ,251,2504,Awesome little tablet!,John,5,-,30-Jul-13,3,0,"I did not purchase this item through Amazon but through Staples. They had a $30 coupon code and I was being cheap. I've learned my lesson. Below is a copy of my review that I posted on Staples.com:

First let me say the only reason I purchased this through Staples instead of Amazon was the $30 coupon code. Staples has become aggressive and quite competitive but it appears to have come at a price. The packaging used to ship the item was a flimsy cardboard which could hardly be called cardboard. The box arrived partially crushed. Inside, the inflatable air packaging was deflated thus providing no benefit whatsoever. I've never had such a poorly packed product in all my orders placed through Amazon. I'll be returning there in the future and would not recommend Staples for anything easily broken.

That being said, the actual box for the N7 survived relatively unscathed.

I've purchased a number of tablets in the past and this is by far the best. It's the perfect size to hold in one hand, to carry along with you, and is quite capable.

The latest version of the Jellybean OS is a joy to use as I've encountered no lag at all. Apps load quickly and run flawlessly on this device. The camera's are just so-so, but can't deduct a star for that as that's pretty normal for tablets. Besides, do people really take pictures with their tablet? Phones seem much better suited for that task and I'm betting most people who have a tablet also have a phone.

The screen on the device is absolutely beautiful with good color saturation and a very hi-res screen comparable to Apple's ""retina"" screen on its devices. The high resolution makes even the smallest text readable.

As the device has just came out, I can't really comment on reliability, but it does feel very solid in the hand and, despite the low cost, just feels like a quality piece of hardware.

I would definitely recommend this tablet as it is one of the best tablets on the market and, for the price, you simply cannot beat it."

Since Fed Ex managed to scan the package, but it never made it to the Fed Ex facility, it is a lost package in transit.

I have been dealing with them for 2 months, wasting 20+ hours going back and forth to have them file a claim for the lost package that Fed Ex has already acknowledged as lost -- sigh. Still nothing.

If that wasn't bad enough, so many people had this problem that I could not trust it not to happen again if I had it repaired. It was purchased in April of 2013 and conked out in June 2014. Needless to say, I did not replace it with another Nexus. I made sure that they will never get my business again, even though I have a Nexus computer and a Nexus laptop.

After having it immediately replaced for a faulty touch screen, I used this tablet on and off for 18 months. When working, the tablet was great. The problem is that after only 18 months and one over the air update pushed to the device from google, my tablet died. After battling with ASUS's terrible customer service, I obtained an RMA and shipped my tablet to Texas to be repaired. The tablet was quickly diagnosed to have a bad motherboard which ASUS would happily repair for $205 (far exceeding the value of the tablet). This exact problem seems to be happening to many people right now (I recommend doing a search to validate), leaving myself and many others with very expensive paperweights. While I understand the tablet only had a 1 year warranty, I also feel that the tablet shouldn't suffer a catastrophic failure after 18 months.

B00DVFLJKQ,252,2515,Original Nexus 7 32gb vs New Nexus 7 32gb,Ben Alwood,5,-,01-Aug-13,3,1,"I had bought the original Nexus 7 32gb knowing I would tinker with it until the new one came out. Therefore when the new one came out I was excited to compare the two side by side. In these tests, the old nexus 7 was freshly reset and upgraded to stock 4.3. Both had the same apps installed and same settings.
Nexus 7 2012 vs Nexus 7 2013:
What has changed:
The 2013 model is actually smaller in width, but taller than the original. While both nexi can fit into a mans front and back pockets, it was easier to pull the new nexus out quicker. The new form factor feels more like a book, and is considerably lighter than the old. The old 32gb feels about twice as heavy as the new. The rubberized back on the old has been replaced with a thin soft price of metal.
The new nexus also has a back facing 5MP camera that takes really good quality photos in daylight and well lit interiors. The camera does not have a flash however, and is very grainy in low light.
The new nexus also now has two sets of ""surround sound"" speakers. I can't really notice the surround sound, but the speakers are the best I've heard on a tablet/phone. Think HTC one but more clear and located on the back. A welcome addition I hope will follow suit on other tablets.
The nexus 2013 also has a 1920x1200 screen, with the highest PPI of any tablet on the market (even beats iPads.) The screen is noteable sharper and brighter than the original nexus with both brightness settings on high.
Both tablets are incredibly fluid, responding well to every finger motion. The 2013 version opens apps quicker however, due to its new snapdragon processor.
The front camera is much more fluid on the new nexus, however both front cameras are a bit grainy in low light (to be expected).
These are all welcome additions and worth the extra money in my opinion. If you don't feel like spending the extra $100 for the new nexus, the old one still runs perfectly fine. I gave my girlfriend the reset old one and she loves it. (Used to have a 1st gen iPad)
I give this 5 stars a because its everything I've wanted in a tablet. The only thing that ASUS could improve upon is to add an LED flash.

update: Ran a homemade test comparing the battery life of the old and new nexus 7. I ran 3 identical movies back to back at the same time on both tablets with the same brightness and all other settings off. The old nexus 7 had about 35 mins longer life than the new 9h20m vs 9h54m , probably due to the full HD screen and faster processor."

If you by chance run out of juice, you may be unpleasantly surprised how long it takes before you can start using the unit again. It take over an hour to recover any function. You plug it in and end up looking at a black screen for an hour, before a blinking battery icon lights up. And than you wait another hour before you can use it. That is an unacceptable shortcoming."
B00DVFLJKQ,252,2519,"The best 7"" tablet made.....",Paul S.,5,-,03-Feb-15,1,0,Hands down the best 7 inch tablet made. I have both the 2012 and 2013 model. The 2013 (flo) is quite a jump over the original nexus 7 (grouper). Lightning fast in standard tasks. Its hard to get it to lag. Plays any game in the play store without struggle. The real fun comes when you unlock and root this device. If you choose to go this route you won't be disappointed. If your looking for a 7 inch tablet look no more.

B00DVFLJKQ,252,2520,Old Nexus 7 owners who game on this tablet be aware.,Liqmaticus,4,-,29-Jul-13,3,0,"I bought my 32GB model early at a local WalMart last Saturday, July 27th to replace my old Nexus 7. Without thinking I started to install all my games from Google Play and I then had a DUH! moment. This is a Snapdragon S4 Pro SOC platform and ALL my THD (Tegra HD) titles from my old Tegra 3 GPU based Nexus 7 will not work on this new Nexus 7. I know I should have realized this, but I had a geriatric moment when I bought the thing. So I am probably still going to sell my old Nexus 7, and eventually get a NVidia Shield or a Tegra 4 equivalent for my THD gaming needs on Android. I just wish Google had stuck with the Tegra 4, but I am guessing price and timing had something to do with it.

With that said. This is a fantastic tablet and is much snappier than the original. Nova 3 was a very demanding FPS that ran terribly on the original Nexus 7 with enormous frame lag. On the new Nexus 7 Nova 3 runs buttery smooth and is now completely playable. Another favorite title of mine is a game called Horn, but unfortunately that title goes to just a black screen on the new Nexus 7. Hopefully the dev will update this title to work. Which brings up another matter. Some titles are not working on the new Nexus 7 due to compatibility issues which probably just needs the dev to update the list of compatible devices such as Asphalt 7: Heat others have problems because of the new 4.3 OS. So the dust needs to settle. 90% of my purchased apps worked on the new Nexus 7 out of the gate, so that is not too bad."
B00DVFLJKQ,253,2521,Google and Nexus Finally Take it to Apple and iPad,Amazon Customer,5,-,28-Oct-13,2,0,"Despite being heavily immersed in Google Apps-I've had an Android phone since 2.1 and I use a Chromebook for 80% of my computing-I have held off on getting an Android tablet as they've seemed compromised until now. After reading the first reviews of this Gen 2 Nexus 7 I took the leap and picked a 32gb model up from my local Staples. I purchased another the next day for my wife as she insisted on one as soon as she saw it. Yes there was an immediate over the air update that I guess resolved a lot of the issues I've been reading about, but I'm honestly surprised by all of the complaints especially given we have 2 in the house without problems.

I honestly could not be happier with the Nexus 7. I use it for media consumption YouTube, Netflix, Kindle, Flipboard, Currents, Google Play Movies and Music. Google Play Music All Access is a real game changer. And I also use it at work to keep track of my notes on Google Keep and check out YouTube videos using Chromecast on the big screen.

My kids who have iPad Minis are coveting their parents' Nexus 7s b/c of the size and screen mainly. They are actually finding Android 4.3 more open to use believe it or not, and we keep a family gmail account so we can share apps and content across our Android devices.

Big Pros:

Battery life - I used it for 2 movies and several hours of reading and music on a transatlantic flight and only made a 20% dent in the battery
Screen - bright and clear as only an iPad can dream of
Size - 7 inch letterbox form factor is perfect to hold as a book (I read with it every night!) and with the right case great for movies etc.
Not an Apple device so you aren't walled in.
CHROMECAST - this is a gamechanger. Don't hesitate to buy with the Nexus 7.
Price: $300 incl tax for 32gb is hard to beat compared to what else is out there.
Stock Android 4.3 - super clean to use and snappy!

Cons:
Screen glass seams to pick up even light scratches more than my Galaxy S4 phone - get a protector immediately - I didn't!
Micro USB is a bit finicky but at least pretty much everyone has one if you need it.
No SD card - while its not been an issue I like the convenience of having an SD card on my phone especially for sharing files.
Lack of Flash - only an occasional inconvenience though.

If you are using Google Apps / Cloud products and unless you are heavily invested in Apple's App store there's absolutely no reason to not consider a Nexus 7 over iPad mini. And combined with Chromecast its a pretty unbeatable and compelling media device."

B00DVFLJKQ,253,2525,Nice step up.,Stephen Mathews,4,-,30-Jul-13,2,0,"Google really nailed it on the first generation and they sure came out with another humdinger. As I said, I loved the first generation Nexus 7, but I like this one even more. Google addressed a few of my dislikes on the first Nexus 7 with this one.

+s
I love the screen clarity and crispness. I didn't really mind the previous generations screen until I saw this one's. The first generation had a pixel density of 216 ppi. the new Nexus is a 323 ppi HD display putting it at a greater ppi then the Nexus 10, and further separating itself itself in display resolution from the Ipad mini. Granted, that is nearing a year old device.

The dual speakers; the speaker on the old Nexus 7 and 4 annoyed me a lot, but these are not only clearer and crisper, but also louder.

It's a Nexus.

Android 4.3; in 4.3 Google added trimming which should make it so that we don't run into the same slowdown issues as with the first generation, but I can't confirm it since I haven't been using long enough yet.

The construction; It feels lighter and thinner than the first generation. I, personally, like the new dimensions as well. It fits into a pocket better than the previous 7. And for a 7 inch screen the previous Nexus 7 was insanely pocketable.

The back, which is also a con. They changed the back of the Nexus 7 quite a bit. It now feels a little more premium in my opinion, but took away the nice grippy texture that made it so nice to hold so this will be on the ""cons"" as well.

The internals on it are very premium, but Google kept the price down yet again.

Wireless charging; I loved the wireless charging ability of the nexus 4 and now the Nexus 7 has it. Since the QI charger I have for my Nexus 4 has two charging places I should, theoretically, be able to charge both the my 7 and 4 at the same time.

HDMI output; I was very disapointed that I could not, very easily get my content off the first generation nexus nexus on to a big screen. The first generation Nexus was a very productive friendly tablet with one thin missing, but they solved that with the new Nexus

-s

The back; as I said before, it looks more premium but doesn't feel quite as comfortable in hand.

Battery life; I think it is going to be less than the first generation (which was very impressive, 10 hours.) but, yet again, I haven't had it long enough to know for certain. I will try to update once I have used the device enough to get a better Idea.

Other thoughts:

I haven't seen anything about miracast mentioned in conjunction with the new Nexus 7. I hope it was included but I, as of yet, don't have the necessary Netgear adapter.

Summation:

I loved the first generation nexus 7 and google's most recent try at it is, hands down, better. I firmly recommend it. It is not only a great choice for the price, but it might also be the best choice for any 7ish inch tablets out there."

This is a very good tablet with very nice features. I own the 2012 model and I have been satisfied with its performance. This 2013 model adds a secondary camera, a very crisp display, doubles the memory (RAM) and sports a better performing processor. I have done comparisons side by side between the old model and this one and the new model clearly stands out with a better display. However, other side by side comparisons I have performed I have found the newer model to be faster in most tasks but not anything significant. Battery life definitely goes in favor of the old 2012 model. The way I see it this is a very good tablet, native Android OS support, good amount of RAM and a fast processor. If you don't have the old Nexus 7 (2012) model, this is without a doubt the tablet I'd recommend. On the other hand, if you are thinking of upgrading from the 2012 model, I don't think it is a worthwhile upgrade. In my opinion, there is not anything significant that is screaming upgrade now, at least in my opinion. The addition of a micro SD card slot would have been a tremendous new feature and a game changer. My advice if you have the 2012 model and were thinking of upgrading is to let this one go and wait for the generation that follows."

I am a ""non techie"" grandmother of 10 who's Ipod was stolen from my suitcase on my last travels. I no longer have a grandchild in town to transfer my over 200 CD's to ITunes then to a device. I am very comfortable with Android as I have had Samsung Galaxy S2 & S3 phones for several year.

My questions:
1. Since I plan to purchase the NEXUS 7 2013 32GB LTE when it is available .. would the quality of the sound be equal to the repurchase of an Apple iPod touch 32 GB (4th Generation) .. or do I need to purchase both?

2. Having read that with ITunes threads/cd's etc get ""lost"" .. it concerns me because after this process I plan to eliminate my library of cd's as a part of our downsizing to a smaller home. When the cd's are gone .. they are gone .. plus I probably would not even notice the loss of a few threads or cd's on itunes at my age .. but if I did it sure would irritate me! SO .. is ITunes the only game in town ..is there a better resource .. OR is there a good way NOT to get things ""lost"" when dealing with iTunes?

I now use my Nexus 7 (my S3 plan allows wifi tethering), and I love it. In apps where I use a large font, the bigger screen seems to provide about double the viewing area of my phone. Many games are now enjoyable, although some are still unplayable (the screen resolution is quite high, so games that fix a font size based on the resolution do not have noticeably bigger text on the Nexus 7 than the S3).

Unlike the iPad mini, the Nexus 7 is tolerably comfortable for holding in one hand for extended periods (it's a little narrower and not as slippery as the iPad mini).

I also enjoy using a stylus and ""Note Anytime"" to take a few terse notes during meetings -- for more involved writing tasks I would still use paper due to the imprecision and small writing area the 7"" screen provides.

Note the Magnification accessibility feature in Android 4.3 works, although I found it interfered with game control, making game control sluggish.

I tried everything: restarting, factory resetting, etc... Everything the people from ASUS technical support advised. It was useless, the sound stopped working and the tablet sometimes restarted without reason.
I finally decided to RMA the tablet. I sent it to ASUS, waited almost three weeks between shipping it to Texas, waiting for ASUS to fix it and then for ASUS to ship it back to me. I also had to spend a lot of money on shipping because I live outside the US, so I had to pay air shipping to the US twice. Once to send it, and another one to get it.
Finally, the tablet arrived. I was so excited! Imagine my surprise when I unpacked it, turned it on and tested it. The sound stopped working after a few minutes. I contacted ASUS support and explained them the problem, again. All they offered was to RMA, again. I told them I wasn't going to send it back to the US a second time.

I frequently use facebook, twitter, and google and those apps and several others work quite well. I use yahoo mail and it has several flaws. One of my favorite games is Ruzzle and it frequently hangs on the nexus. I found instructions on the net to be able to view Amazon videos on Dolphin. It wasn't particularly easy to do but I accomplished it. It does seem like it has to be tweeked whenever the os is updated. I have an iPhone 5 and all the apps I use work fine and in many cases, slightly better than the nexus. I never tried to watch Amazon videos on the iPhone though.

If I had it to do over I would probably still buy the nexus because of the price difference. If money were no object, I would probably get the iPad.

Seems as if Google is ashamed of this product and offers no solution except to pay Asus over $200 to have it repaired or buy their new Nexus 9. Ha!"
B00DVFLJKQ,255,2541,I normally don't give things 5 stars...,sleighdo,5,-,03-Aug-13,5,0,"I just got the new nexus 7 yesterday and spent most of today playing with it. Most of my impressions can be summed up in one word: WOW!!!!. The screen is fantastic (why anyone would spend $200 more and buy a iPad mini with that crappy screen, I do not know). I know there have been reports of these being shipped out with lots of dead pixels, but after running 2 different dead pixel tests I still don't see any. Not one. 0 dead pixels out of 2,304,000 is pretty spectacular. This is my first true android device (I don't count the Kindle Fire HD as true android), so part of what impresses me so much is the os. I like apple products. But I have to jailbreak any iOS device to get it to stop annoying me (either with restrictions or ""features"" I would like to turn off but can't). I love that I can download files, then open up a file browser (ES Files Explorer) and make new folders, move stuff around, zip and unzip files... It's so powerful just having access to a file manager (hugely lacking is iOS devices). I love that I can make a folder on my desktop that has all my encrypted PDFs that are hundreds of pages long and open them as quickly as I would be able to on a desktop. The nexus is incredibly responsive, even when switching between a very graphically intensive game and a web browser. Everything I have done has been smooth with no crashes. The battery life is definitely what they claim. I used it HEAVILY from about 7am until about 4:30pm, downloading and installing apps while looking online for more apps to get, while also trying out those apps and messing with every setting there is. At 4:30pm I had 15% battery. That should be more than long enough for my business trip I have on monday (I'm flying, not driving ;). I was very surprised at how cool it stayed, even while using it heavily. I was doing all the things listed above while a game was downloading 3gb+ of data in the background and it was barely warmer than room temperature. I cant say enough about The new Nexus 7. I haven't run across anything I don't like yet (other than a few features that I CAN turn off). Basically, I will never buy another iOS device again. I'm sooooo glad I waited the 2 months for this to come out. I was going to get the memo pad hd7, but decided to get this instead and I'm so glad I did. If you want a small tablet, buy this one. Period."

B00DVFLJKQ,255,2545,Amazing device!,John P.,5,-,25-Aug-13,2,0,"I have to say...for the price, I couldn't possibly ask for more than what this amazing little tablet delivers.
A gorgeous screen, near limitless options for customization/personalization, 32gb memory, great sound, blazing speeds...the list goes on and on.
All I have to say is, if you're in the market for a 7 inch tablet, this purchase is an absolute no-brainer.

The only thing I can think of for improvement is the camera. After having great experiences with my HTC phones' cameras, this camera is admittedly a bit of a let-down. That being said, I prefer to use my more compact phone for taking pictures anyway, so the fact that there is even a rear camera on here at all is really a bonus.

Seriously though, incredible and beautiful device that is an absolute pleasure to use!

B00DVFLJKQ,255,2546,Almost Perfect - Charger Issues,Amazon Customer,4,-,20-Aug-14,-,1,"Love my Nexus 7... except for one huge flaw. The input for the charger cable is too shallow and the charging cable is cheap. I had to replace the cable after 3 months. Now I have to carefully place the cable in and not touch it or it will fall out. It's only 9 months old, so that was unexpected. Despite that, I love this tablet. It's a good size, just big enough to enjoy books/TV on and it doesn't tire your hands like a giant iPad will. The speakers are impressive and the battery life is very good."
B00DVFLJKQ,255,2547,This tablet is AMAZING for the price,Michael,5,-,08-Aug-13,5,2,"I never owned the original nexus 7(was waiting for this one). But I can say this: Its an amazing tablet. I have owned other tablets from different companies and figured I wasn't a tablet kind of person. But after buying this, I'm glad to say I use it more than my Galaxy S3. Here are the pros and con's:

Pros:
1. The price. Print an office max coupon for 20 percent off any tablets until Saturday August 10th. Just search on Google ""20 off nexus 7 office max."" Oddly enough, office max wouldn't honor it. But Staples did! So I got my brand new 32GB Nexus 7 for $233, that includes tax! Pretty awesome price.
2. This thing is a snappy, speedy machine. It makes my Galaxy S3 feel slow and sluggish, like a dinosaur device. I'm not exaggerating, it is *FAST*.
3. The display. Never owned a 1080p device before. This will display will blow your mind. You can't make out ANY pixels whatsoever no matters how hard you look, and text looks as crisp as ever. Looks even better when watching movies on Netflix!
4. Design. I really like it. The larger bezels at the tops make gaming even better, and the thin side bezels make it look great. The back of the device is my favorite part. Its smooth and slightly rubbery for extra grip. Matte I would say. The glossy ""NEXUS"" letters hoping across the back stands out a lot, which is a pro for me ;-)
5. Speakers. These are very,very good speakers. When I'm listening to music full blast on these things you can't tell if the tablet is hooked up to an external stereo or not. They're that good. Very loud.
6. The keyboard. On board comes a jelly bean style keyboard. Best keyboard I have ever used. Hands down. Its simple, aesthetically pleasing, and makes a satisfying sound every click of a key. (Typing this on the Nexus 7 now, in fact)
7. Notification LED. I really like it at the bottom. It looks unique and stands out a lot so I can see if I have a notification without looking at the display. Very nice.

Now for the con's(not many):

1. No SD card slot. This is kind of an obvious con if you're a music lover like me, then its kind of a hassle to get your music over to the device. I never really got into the cloud based storage apparatus's but if you're into that then it shouldn't be a problem.
2. If I had to choose another con, then it would be that you can't add or remove home screens. This isn't really the tablets fault- but Google's. They think 5 home screens is just the right amount for EVERYONE. Quite a broad statement. Well not for me Google. I have two completely blank home screens and being the OCD person I am, that bothers me. Lol. But probably won't bother too many people. Better too much than too less...

Anyways, that pretty much sums it up. I don't know if anyone will read this, but if you did, I hope it helped. So my advice, if you're looking for a tablet, get this one."
B00DVFLJKQ,255,2548,Very nice,Barney D.,5,-,14-Nov-13,2,1,"My first tablet and I think it's great. It feels like a quality product. I have yet to give it a real test. My only gripe is that it uses a slightly different OS than my phone, but it looks and feels much different. I am also trying to figure out how to stream video to my TV. It seems like tablet manufacturers are making this deliberately difficult.
I did a lot of research before buying this and I do believe you get you best bang for you buck by far."
B00DVFLJKQ,255,2549,Not this stupid thing. A years worth of photo and video ...,Amazon Customer,1,-,31-Dec-15,-,2,"I have never had a cracked screen before on any device until this one. The crack came about from carelessly resting a hand on top of the tablet and putting a little pressure on it as I stood up. It was on a soft surface, so it must have been from the bend in the frame ever so slightly. And, now, it is a piece of junk. When iPhone screens crack, I've seen them still be responsive to touch. Not this stupid thing. A years worth of photo and video of my very young son- all gone. I hate this thing so much. I've since bought an iPad. Yes, Asus/Google, I am no longer your fan or friend."
B00DVFLJKQ,255,2550,"Well designed, poorly assembled, and Horrific Customer Service",Kudzu Kard,1,-,06-Jun-14,7,1,"First off, anything from Asus is garbage in my mind. I myself have never had any luck with their products and a few I know haven't either. I would buy this from Google (if you have to) as they will probably be more responsive to your needs. First off I am an Computer Science and Electrical Engineer. I am not a huge fan of Android (turned down my third interview at Google if you mush know a few years back). However, it has proven itself in the market and people seem to like it better than iOS (they are split about 50-50 it seems). That is not the problem with this device. The device is the problem. Yes Android supposedly had a battery issue within the OS where if it got below a certain level you had to go through some reboot sequence to fix it or else update the OS...I won't go into detail, but you can read about it.

NOPE, this is a quality of manufacturing issue. The device belongs to my girlfriend's son who actually got the extended warranty which I thought covered EVERYTHING. Not according to ASUS. The first thing he noticed is sometimes his device would not charge all the way. I was thinking battery, but then it stopped completely. OK, you have the warranty send it back. NOT that easy. They were on the phone for hours with Google, Walmart (where it was purchased) and even ASUS. Seriously folks, THEY BOUGHT the extended Warranty!

SO they sent it in to ASUS. They sent an email that it was going to cost $150 to fix. What? The device was $229 when he bought it back in December or January. So they sent it back. Time for the engineer to look into it. Took it to work and be ****ed the warranty, I took it all apart. The issue you ask? Poor soldering! YEP, VERY POOR (Thank you cheap Chinese labor). They call it abuse, but the micro-USB on the board is inadequate as it is. What did I do? A new connector, soldered a lot more reliably and voila' FIXED! And they wanted $150? Her son is convinced never again to buy anything from ASUS. My girlfriends Dell tablet and my iPad are working just fine!"
B00DVFLJKQ,256,2551,Wicked First Tablet,Mr. Cody Daniel,5,-,23-Oct-13,1,0,"My first foray into the tablet world and I'm completely sold. On the first ""honeymoon"" day I spent the battery in 28hrs with constant browsing, video streaming, and many, many downloaded/deleted apps.

The second day I went for a more typical usage profile and burned 15% over the course of the day. For me this is the most critical feature of a tablet, as I'm moving to replace my smartphone with a tablet, and it more than lives up to the call.

But don't let that fool you! The Nexus 7 serves up incredible performance in every category! It feels like the future; maps are joyful to use again with such a big screen and fast response, video is bright and the speakers crisp and loud, streaming is seamless and wi-fi/4G transitions smooth and painless. Hell I haven't touched my laptop in three days because I love this tablet so much! And that's the goal; a complete travel computer in under a pound!

Just purchased the chromecast, which should make presentations easy off of this little guy, and I can't imagine any complaints I would wage against this product in the coming weeks. Buy it!"
B00DVFLJKQ,256,2552,"Just buy it, you know you want to.",James,5,-,10-Aug-13,2,1,"I got mine only a week ago but let me tell you, I love this thing. Games run smooth if you are into the mobile games, very quick with switching tabs and windows, has a great sound when watching or listening to something and I ran this thing for 16 hours without a recharge. Granted, I am on of those people who will force stop apps to preserve my battery life and the screen was on and off (casual web surfing and such) but it said 16 hours, made me happy.

The screen is as slick as ice, your fingers just glide across it with what feels like no friction at all. This thing may look like it's thin, light and plastic but it feels very nice and durable in the hand. Hate running web pages in mobile format? Feel free to switch to desktop format and it still runs very slick and quick.

The only problem I have is the buttons only because I'm not use to the location, it is not a bad thing, it's more of a muscle memory thing. So buy it, spoil yourself and treat yourself to a great piece of technology and I have a feeling you will not regret it. The moment you unwrap it, you will know you have made a great decision.

Don't forget to download Avast and Clean Master to keep it running like new!

It is as the seller noted however, I received the lte version. I got it all set up and have been enjoying it immensely. Its way more powerful and much faster than my Asus transformer tf700 is.

B00DVFLJKQ,256,2554,Review of Nexus 7-2 (2013) vs Nexus 7-1 (2012),Jay,5,-,15-Nov-13,5,1,"This is my very first Amazon review. I figured this would be a good item to start with. For background, I'm both an Apple and Android user. My phone is an HTC One. I sold my Nexus 7 (2012) to purchase this one. Here are the reasons why:

Form factor - right way, you can tell the Nexus 7-2 is thinner and weighs a little less. This is important to me as I hate holding tablets, especially my iPad.

Speed - I read reviews where the benchmarks for the new Nexus are twice as fast as the original. It clearly shows as I have very little lag. On the Nexus 7-1, I noticed lag when I surfed the web and the pages were data heavy. I absolutely hate trying to scroll down a page when it's lagging. The Nexus 7-2 has very little lag. In fact, it's almost indistinguishable from my HTC One in terms of speed.

Screen - the resolution is night and day between Nexus 7-2 and Nexus 7-1. It's almost like switching from a non-retina Apple to a retina Apple (okay, maybe not that extreme but it's pretty close).

Slimport - This is one of the main reasons I upgrade. With the slimport, you can just plug in the optional adapter and watch Netflix, Dish Anywhere, Hulu, etc. on your big screen television through HDMI. This saves me from having to pay a monthly fee for another receiver.

Other perks - The speakers are supposed to be better but I don't turn them up high enough to notice a difference. Also, the camera on the tablet is worthless to me as I don't use it.

Overall, Slimport was the reason for the upgrade for me. The speed and resolution and night and day compared to the original. You can sell your original on Amazon and upgrade to the new edition for roughly $40-$60. If you're currently happy with your original Nexus, then there's no need to upgrade. For a techie guy like myself, I can't see myself going back to the original version. The extra $50 is clearly worth it to me as I'll save more than that from my cable receiver rental fees."
B00DVFLJKQ,256,2555,Great! make sure to run updates,S. Lee,5,-,06-Aug-13,85,14,"I am going to defer 99% of my review to others. Yes it's got an amazing form factor. The screen is impeccable. blah blah blah. If you are reading this, then you probably have read a dozen other reviews already. So let me focus my review on two things:

1) Wifi streaming of DLNA server content: The biggest knock on the original Nexus was the poor wifi adapter. When I first started using my new Nexus 7 for DLNA streaming 1080p mkv files a couple of days ago, nothing worked. In fact, the new Nexus 7 couldn't even stream 720p mkv files. For DLNA streaming, I run PS3 media server on my computer. On the Nexus 7, I use Bubble uPnP as my DLNA client and MX Player as my player. After the most recent MX Player patch and the Nexus 7 patch, I am able to stream 1080p mkv content flawlessly. That which would not work pre-patch is now working without stutter. So the wifi adapter appears to be a lot better than the original Nexus 7. I am sustaining anywhere from 70-150 Mbps speeds. More than adequate for my needs.

2) So with the streaming thing fixed, I only have one remaining issue with the Nexus 7. Chrome, yes Google Chrome. I find it difficult to select hyperlinks on chrome. There is a delay before my touch activation of a hyperlink takes effect. It's not always like this, but this delay occurs about 50% of the time. 4.3 is still being patched and app makers are still optimizing their content, so it is possible that this is just an early Nexus 7/4.3 issue. Hopefully it isn't the actual touch sensor on the screen. I wouldn't call it a show stopper, but it is a significant nuisance. Additionally, there is slight tearing of the page when i scroll. I am a fast reader, so I tend scroll webpages and read simultaneously. With the tearing, it is quite annoying. All these issues seem to be related specifically to chrome.

One final addendum: 4.3 defaults. The wireless adapter doesn't run on high settings out of the box. You actually have to go into the settings to change this. I guess they did this to increase battery life for the majority of users. But if you are a power user, then I recommend you go into wifi settings and change it. Unchecking ""Wi-Fi optimization"" changed my Nexus 7 from wireless G(54Mbps) to wireless N(~70Mbps@2.4 Ghz and ~150Mbps@5Ghz for this model). So the ""optimization"" is a misnomer. It doesn't optimize the wifi, it optimizes the battery and weakens the wifi. The other feature I would shut off is ""scanning always available"". When I shut off my wifi, I don't want my wifi to be scanning for open networks, for battery conservation and for security reasons. So if you change those two settings, you should be green on your wifi.

Regarding all the other features, I defer to others' comments. This is a fantastic product. Not only is it the best 7"" tablet right now, I believe it to be the best tablet PERIOD. I do read the comments, so if you would like me to test other features, please let me know. I have quite a bit of technical knowledge and experience with android, and I will try to help where possible.

UPDATE
When I use Dolphin browser, the hyperlink issue stated above and the tearing when scrolling is gone. So for now, I will be using the Dolphin Browser. Chrome seems to be buggy/laggy in android 4.3/nexus 7. So it appears the touch sensor is not the problem, which is good news.

ADDENDUM
I have been asked to speak on the GPS issue that is being reported on Nexus 7 FHD. I use my phone for gps and don't plan on using the Nexus 7 for GPS...but I tested it any ways for you all. Currently, I am unable to get any type of GPS satellite lock. ""Searching for GPS"" is the error I get continually. Google recently stated they are aware of this issue and are currently working to resolve it. Now ASUS is notorious for having horrible GPS antennas in their devices. If you think GPS is a make or break feature, then I would hold off on buying the Nexus 7. There is no guarantee that the GPS issue is a software issue, i.e. can be resolved with a patch. If it is a hardware issue, which is yet unclear, then you may be buying a device incapable of real-world GPS functionality. If this changes, and I will test it the next time I see a patch, I will return here with another addendum.

UPDATE 9/23/2013
GPS is now working. Well, let me rephrase that. I am some times able to get GPS lock. By no means is it reliable yet. At least I can now some times get GPS lock. If you have a phone, use that. I wouldn't rely on this tablet currently as your sole source of GPS.

UPDATE 11/25/2013
KitKat is out for the Nexus 7. So far, I notice a vast improvement while web browsing."
B00DVFLJKQ,256,2556,The Decidedly Amazing Nexus 7: A Qualitative Review,Alex,5,-,02-Sep-13,-,0,"First off, I'm not going to quote specs or benchmarks or pixel density numbers in this review. If those matter to you (they did to me), you don't need me to find them and will likely interpret them better than I could. I'd rather talk about the overall experience of owning and using the 2013 Google Nexus 7. And, all the impressive stats aside, the more qualitative aspects of this tablet are where it really shines!

I bought this tablet a few weeks ago after a ridiculous amount of research into the ins and outs of every tablet on the market (and every tablet soon to be on the market) and instantly noticed the uncommon and refreshing lack of buyers' remorse! As I booted it up and let Google's friendly UI walk me through the pleasantly simple sign-ins, I took the time to just sort of soak in the exterior of the machine. You will not be disappointed with the way it looks and the way it feels in your hand! From the just-grippy-enough smooth texture, to the comfortable transition between frame and glass where my fingers rest, to the classy, landscape-oriented ""nexus"" branding that adorns the back, this device's looks seem to contradict its price tag! I often find myself holding the tablet even when I have no use of it, simply because it feels nice in my hand!

In writing this, I have determined that the display on the Nexus 7 deserves its own paragraph. It is sharp. It is clear. It is colorful. It is bright. There are many ways to describe the screen, but the best way I can think to describe it is thusly: it is so crisp and clear that you might not notice it when you're browsing the web or checking your email (you'll forget that browsing ever looked any blurrier!), but the second you boot up a game, or start a movie, or even just navigate back to your brightly colored wallpaper, you will remember every one of those 2.3 million pixels! Absolutely everything -- from the latest HD movie to a browser tab in Chrome -- looks amazing and crystal-clear on this display! The Nexus 7 would have been a great device with an average screen, but the incredible display is what makes it amazing!

That said, the performance of any device is really important for using it to be a happy experience. The Nexus does not fail us there. It is zippy and eager to please! Apps boot up quickly, games run startlingly well (I've particularly been enjoying the brand-new Asphalt 8, which runs without a hitch), and menus open without the lag that characterizes older devices. Speaking of menus, I should add that Android 4.3 is really nice! I think you'll enjoy the minimalist style and soothing color scheme that 4.3 has to offer (not to mention the significant performance gains that come with it)!

The really remarkable thing about this tablet is that it simply will run any app, task, or game you throw at it! And with impressive grace! It's refreshing to use a device that seems so comfortable in its own skin. In the same vein, some of Google's software really helps the device find its place in my life. I'm thinking especially of Google Now and the improved voice search, which, although not perfect, do a really incredible job of providing information both when you ask for it and when it suspects you might need it! I found Now was providing me directions to the restaurant before I even remembered I needed to look it up! And voice search did a great job of answering my questions (especially unit conversions and other such trivia)! Also, if there were one other app from the Google lineup that I would recommend, it's the phenomenal, note-taking Google Keep. Very pleasant on the 7 inch screen, Keep has really helped me keep track of things despite my decidedly scattered brain!

If I had to list one drawback, it would be that I have experienced a few glitches with the keyboard. Nothing catastrophic -- as can be attested for by the fact that I'm writing this review on it -- but enough to be noticeable every once in a while. I'm sure that this will be addressed in one of the coming patches.

All in all, this a wonderful device that quickly won my heart and has continued to perform brilliantly, no matter what I throw at it. It's become a really pleasant part of my everyday technology use, and never fails to put a little smile on my face!

I highly recommend this device to anyone looking for a well-equipped, fairly portable tablet; you're going to love it!!!"
B00DVFLJKQ,256,2557,Shoddy quality -- failed twice in one year.,Charlotte Pressler,1,-,26-Oct-14,2,0,"One star for shoddy quality. I bought one of these about a year ago and will never buy one again. The tablet itself was fine, but the mini-USB port into which the charger plugged failed twice. It would not accept or hold the charger plug, so the tablet could not recharge, making it useless. The first time the mini-USB port failed, the device was under warranty. It was repaired in about two weeks with no charge, but some inconvenience. The second time it failed happened just a week ago. I was advised that the tablet was out of warranty. It would cost me around $200 for the repair, which is close to the price of a new one. To have the same part fail twice in one year is too much, even if it is a convenient way of building sales of new units. I expect products I but to be reliable and to last."

I was pretty positive about the product and thought i might have downloaded some buggy app, so went for hard factory reset ... Thats ""THE END"". it got ""STUCK"" at the recovery page for ever.
I contacted Best buy, Google and finally Asus could help by repairing it and i got it back after ""2 WEEKS"".

Life was good, it was working good until yesterday night. This morning I see it is ""STUCK"" at google logo screen.. Thats ""THE END AGAIN"". This time i did not have any third party app which could have have done the mess. As tablet was not USB debugging enabled i could not even flash. Nether Google nor Asus online support could help.

B00DVFLJKQ,257,2562,Random freeze and restart as well as erratic screen jumping out of box,James,2,-,30-Nov-13,4,0,"This is my first tablet purchase and I have to say it is fast and very responsive when opening up most apps, tabs, swiping gestures, etc. and its light & fits very comfortably in one hand (which can't be said for many tablets out there)... BUT:

Here are my Google Nexus 7 issues within the first day after purchase:
- random freeze and reboot (happened SIX times and apparently this is common - google search ""Nexus 7 random freeze and restart""); freeze happened twice during stock setup wizard immediately out of the box and still happened even after KitKat 4.4 update
- multitouch issue (again, common)
- screen/page erratic jumping (prior to KitKat update)
- keyboard space bar works half the time
- cable loose while charging (on all Nexus 7s) - poor design on ASUS's part
- while running Google's own Google Maps app - street view isn't an option (yet its there and works on Apple iPad??)
- Pandora widget freezes constantly and app load screen is slow to load
- Many apps aren't really designed for android devices yet function superbly on Apple devices (Wells Fargo can't deposit checks w/ camera, Pandora freezes, Google's own Google Maps street view ... )

I really wanted to be happy with my first Android product but I guess you get what you pay for. It's like comparing a Mac to a PC: There are so many android devices out there with various hardware configurations and cheaply made components and a huge disconnect between hardware and software performance - its probably best to stick with the companies that develop both the hardware AND the software, thus ensuring reliable communication between the two, thorough testing, better performance and a higher level of overall quality control (functionally and aesthetically).. even if it is more expensive its usually worth it (...even if it means selling your soul to Apple - then again Android OS doesn't exactly follow the open source ideal either)

I generally avoid leaving reviews about electronic/mobile devices because then I'd be admitting I partake in the world of endless consumption (where we the consumers have become the actual product)... but... admittedly I long for an alternative other than Apple or Google products.. I guess it could be worse though (did someone say Microsoft?)"
B00DVFLJKQ,257,2563,Brilliant tablet.,R. A. Fulcher,5,-,24-Oct-13,1,0,"My first entry to tablet ownership was the original Nexus 7, late last December. Great device, but the Nexus 10's amazing display drew me in, so I traded up.

But... that Nexus 7 form factor is tough to beat. Easy to hold in one hand, lightweight. The Nexus 10, although beautiful, is neither of those after 20 or so minutes of use without propping it. I reasoned if I had the 7's form factor with the 10's display quality, it'd be a winner. So I bought the newer 7.

Wow. The screen is just as beautiful as the Nexus 10, just smaller. Holding my Nexus 7 at comfortable arm's length, I'm seeing a bigger screen than my 52"" Samsung LCD HDTV across the room -- and still seeing the same number of pixels. So, for many applications, the Nexus 7 display is quite enough space.

The rear-facing 5MP camera is really not that bad, and fills one of the earlier 7's gaps. I didn't buy it for that camera, but I'd rather have a decent camera than none at all. Haven't tried front-facing camera yet for video calling, but it also looks to be very serviceable.

Speakers - not front-facing as I'd hoped (I really like the Nexus 10 for this), but they are stereo, and they do a FAR better job than the first-gen 7's speakers.

Very smooth and responsive user experience. Even smoother than the Nexus 10.

Battery life is impressive. WiFI performance is great. I just really can't find fault with this tablet. It's a great intro tablet (particularly at the 16 GB price point), and I've not seen any of the instability issues mentioned elsewhere.

Just go for it. It's a great little device."

B00DVFLJKQ,257,2565,Excellent tablet marred by Asus' quality control,Nick C.,3,-,07-Aug-13,3,4,"Ok, so I own an original Nexus 7 and decided to pick up one of these for my last year of college to carry around my notes, documents, etc. My first few hours with the tablet (32GB WiFi model) were excellent. This thing is seriously fast with one of the best screens I've seen on a tablet. It's easily as good as the retina iPad models, though color reproduction and black levels aren't quite as nice, but hey, those are way more expensive. The tablet flies. There's no slowdown anywhere in Android, mostly due to the S4 Pro and the fact that stock Android is a much better option than some company's laggy skin. That said, after playing with it for an hour, I noticed discoloration on the back of mine. I assumed it was just residue from handling it for a while but I was shocked to find I couldn't wipe it off. It turns out there's a portion, at least on the model I had, which was permanently picking up finger prints and smudges. It looked bad and had an odd greasy texture too it. On top of this, I had a bunch of issues with pinching to zoom and some gestures within the Chrome, something my original Nexus 7 (also running 4.3) does not encounter. On top of the small scratches mine also had right out of the box (something I was discouraged by but was going to just put up with before all the other issues piled up), it was enough for me to return it. Don't get me wrong, I love the tablet, but the quality issues really let me down. I'm going to be purchasing another one in hopes that the one I got was just marred by manufacturing defects because they're that good. That said, I'll definitely be wary of the next one, open it in the store, and give it a thorough rundown before I leave with it. I encourage you to do the same. Like I said, I hate docking this tablet stars because I feel it is honestly the best tablet on the market right now, Android, Windows 8, and iOS considered, I just cannot, in good faith, give it a 5 star rating based on the experience I had with my first one. When I find another 32GB model, I will update this review to see if mine was just a strange fluke (because hey, it happens. I went through 3 iPhone 4S' before I got one that wasn't damaged/defective), so I'll update the review accordingly. Until then, be wary of your purchase. If you're buying it from a store, check it first, and if you're picking one up online, make sure their return policy, is accomidating, because you might need to use it. Otherwise, go for it. It's a wonderful tablet with my favorite version of Android since stock Froyo. If you get a good one, you won't be disappointed."

I loved my previous Nexus, but I must say that the new generation is amazing! The tablet is quick and smooth. I like that they shrunk down the side bezels a bit. It's now even easier to hold in one hand. (Try doing that with an iPad mini...)

But the best feature of this tablet is the display. It's extremely crisp, rich with color and very bright with great viewing angles. By far, it's the best display I've seen on a tablet of any size. No other 7 inch tablet even comes close. If you like to watch movies, read or browse pictures, the new Nexus 7 is the best option, without a doubt.

Pair it with a Chromecast, and you can watch Netflix (and more apps coming) on your tv wirelessly. Google has outdone themselves this summer. I highly recommend this new Nexus 7 to anyone and everyone."

On the other hand this very same thing may not be so good for people with not so 20/20 vision. Fonts will seem smaller so be warned, though for me personally it is an excellent display.

I have had this one for about 3 days now and battery life seems pretty good so far. I guess it is the combination of better hardware and the latest OS, but it feels so zippy and buttery smooth. My only gripe (well we do love to complain, dont we :-)). is that the top and bottom bezels, they make the tab look a bit weird shaped, like the iPhone 5, which I guess will take some getting used to.

I almost bought the first one, and finally said what the heck, I need to jump on the bandwagon. I'm the type of person that reads plenty of reviews, so when I looked at the hardware specs, watched videos, I knew this was an excellent buy. I have not been disappointed except with the touchpad keyboard, I'm still not used to doing that on a tablet yet...I've even bought swiftkey and ai keyboard apps ($2.99 each) but I'm sure after another month or so I'll acclimate to the typing. One thing, this is the perfect size for reading kindle books while I'm in bed, and the couple of games I have purchased play very well on this. I fly once a month to every other month, so will be purchasing some movies to put on this for flights, too.

I was able to get the 32GB model for the $269.99 retail price at gamestop, it's on backorder, here on Amazon. I'm a huge Amazon prime buyer, but I'm all for saving 20-30 bucks from other retailers upselling...so if you have a gamestop near you, I'd recommend checking out your local one. It looks like you can get the 16GB for retail on here, though :). Once again, the screen, graphics, and speed of this for the price cannot be beat. This outperforms the iPad mini and is less than half the price of the iPad..sure the iPad has a larger screen, but do you really need a screen that big?

I recommend getting the 32GB version Cuz there isn't any removable storage, but if your familiar with Nexus devices, you already knew that. Anyway this tablet is lag free and an absolute steal at $229 16GB and $269 for the 32GB Wi-Fi tablet.

B00DVFLJKQ,258,2578,"Nexus 7"" 32 GB (2013) DO NOT BUY!",Dan W.,1,-,26-Aug-13,13,4,"ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY

I upgrades from the first generation to the 2013 version becasue I love the first one and was very exited about the improved hardware. I bought my first 2013 model and I loved the screen, the speed and many other features. Then I realized that the GPS is not working. This issue amongst a few others is well documented in other reviews and Google has acknowledged it.

Not being sure if it is a hardware or software issue, I brought it back for exchange. The second tablets had malfunctioning power and volume button. back it went to the dealer. Got a third tablet, took it home, used it for a while. This one still had the same problem with non functioning GPS, but I thought I would wait and hopefully Google would fix the software(?) glitch. After 5 days of use, one morning the tablet didn't turn on anymore. I tried Safe-Mode boot, soft reset and hard reset, Recovery Mode and Restart Bootloader mode. Nothing worked. The only thing I get is either the Google ""cross"" logo and it freezes there or the Android avatar laying on its side with the message ""no command"". Called Google they made me try the same actions with the same results. So I brought it back, yet again to get my 4th (!!!!) tablet. This time again the GPS doesn't work either.... Again I thought I would keep it until just before the 15-day return policy expires.

Here we are after 5 days of having my 4th tablet without a working GPS, it again doesn't boot up and I have they same issues then described above.

For the record, I didn't root any of the tablet and only installed apps from the Play Store.

So now I can bring it back again and decide to either try my 6th tablet or give up and wait for the new iPad mini.

If you look at other reviews you will find that this is not the only problems people encounter with the new version of the Nexus 7""

So my recommendation is very straight forward ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY, while the specs look great, this is a half-baked product. maybe in a few weeks or months Google will come up with a fix, but I think that we should not support a company who markets products that they haven't tested before selling to the public. Problem with one: happens, problem with a second: ok, maybe. But 4 in a row. No thanks!

Update 11/10/2013
As I had mentioned above, I have never had the screen issues that some (many?) are reporting. Since the couple of Android updates that Google has issued, the GPS is working somewhat better, meaning that if I change location it will eventually find the signals and provide position. The operative word is eventually, and even that has to be qualified. If you are indoors you may either be out of luck or it will take several minutes at best. My iPhone 5 as well as my daughters iPhone 3S gets a signal almost instantaneously. The Nexus doesn't.

I don't know if this is a hardware or software issue, but it is sad that Google doesn't stand behind its hardware products. Youc an blame ASUS all you want, I bought the device from Google, not from ASUS. I want Google to fix it, period.

After more then 30 years of faithful commitment to Microsoft, I just bought my first Apple laptop? Why because I was getting tired of Windows being convoluted, where everything is a pain to get around. Mac OS is far from perfect and Apple might be more expensive, but they stand behind their product and services, they try to make the customer's experience simple and easy. Easy, painless and automatic backups such as Time Machine, woahw what a revolutionary concept.... Shouldn't that be the standard for every computer? Hello Microsoft...?

In many ways Google seems to be making the same mistakes MS has, too much of a hands off approach. Backup or migration on an Android is convoluted at best. Why? Why doesn't Google try to make it easy to migrate from one Android device to the next? I migrated from the Nexus 7"" (2011) to the Nexus 7"" (2013). Wouldn't you expect that to be a one action process like it is to migrate from any iPhone/iPad to the next??? Noooo it isn't.

So Google/Asus if you are reading this: I gave you guys two tries, but unless what should be simple things will in fact be simple in the future (migration tools, backups, etc), my next upgrade will not be for another Google/ASUS device. I would hate to become Apple only because I believe in and would like to promote healthy competition, but by the same token, I really don't like to be your guinea pig either.

And by the way, when will you fix the GPS issue????"

Favorite use is streaming video on it because the fantastic screen, and it's portability (it feels great in the hand!).

A great value overall, but not quite my favorite tablet (iPad Air), and I prefer iOS over Android. The main issue for me, however, is the screen sensitivity, particularly when typing. I often use my Nexus to type things, and the keyboard constantly lags and is very inaccurate. All other precision-based gestures are difficult as well, such as web browsing- the screen rarely responds how I wish it would. This really bothers me. Probably not a deal-breaker, but it is really annoying, especially on such an advanced tablet. There's a couple other problems I have with it, but they are mostly minor.

I was looking for a small tablet, but was bummed by the iPad mini's lack of Retina, so I looked to this tablet instead. And after a month with it, I have to say from a predominantly Apple user, I was pleasantly surprised!

The first thing you notice is how comfortable and easy it is on the hands. It's very easy to use for one handed operations and almost feels like a giant phone, rather than a tablet.
For reading, this is prime. It's big enough for viewing all types of media, and is a perfect eReader.
One of my complaints with the full size iPad was that it was uncomfortable to read books on it, because it felt too big and heavy. The Nexus 7 really solves this, by displaying crisp clear text in a small package.
The screen is also very nice at 1920 x 1200. Crisp and clear, and very vibrant. Web pages look great, and video looks amazing.
Android runs really snappy on this beast. I would say much faster than a Samsung or Amazon tablet, from my past experience.

Overall this is a great quality tablet. It's simple, effective and speedy. I would highly recommend this. I'm still an iOS user with my iPhone 5S, but this is a great introduction to the android, world, and really has me thinking about the upcoming Nexus 5 phone!"

It has cool features like live wallpapers and can customize it more with widgets. But I mainly use my iPad mini still because the Nexus restarts itself frequently... It's very annoying and inconvenient. Sometimes I'm in the middle of reading, it restarts itself unexpectedly, so I have to figure out where I left off since I didn't have time to bookmark it. Sometimes I'm in the middle of writing an email, review, or Facebook post... It restarts and I lose everything.

B00DVFLJKQ,261,2607,Warning: Extremely Fragile,Steve,1,-,09-Nov-13,18,12,"Pros:

To be fair, this device has excellent specs. Super responsive and fast. The screen is amazing. Battery last long enough and it's dimensions are great. Too bad it's so fragile.

Cons:

So why only 1 star? I am a deployed soldier and I almost never write reviews, but I was so urked by Asus I felt the need to.

I bought this device specifically to be able to Skype my wife and 3 yr old daughter back home. You can imagine how upset I was when I pulled out my 30 day old Nexus 7 and the screen had a couple hairline cracks, making it unusable (wouldn't respond to touch anymore). Anyone who has dropped a device before knows that screens shatter when dropped. Mine looks pristine and it's obvious that the device wasn't dropped or slammed into anything.

These devices do not have a durable frame at all. One thing that has always bothered me about this device is how much you can flex it by holding the corners and twisting. (Look up reviews for this thing. There's one where they did a drop test. Most tablets can survive at least a couple drops. This thing didn't even survive one!)

I contacted Asus and 1st they told me to contact the seller (unfortunately it wasn't Amazon. I wish it had been now because I'm sure that they actually care about soldiers seeing their families back home). The seller said it was out of their return period so they couldn't do anything.

I contacted ASUS again. This time they said it was ""physical damage"" so I would have to pay $160 + shipping to have it fixed. That's 60% the cost of the tablet!

This was my first and LAST Asus purchase. From now on, I'm only purchasing from companies that actually stand behind their products and the troops. I'm just glad I have good friends over here that will let me borrow their stuff..."

Update Sep 6 2013:

Sometimes I can get a location fix, mostly no. The update did not help at all. Made no difference. Touch screen accuracy and typing sensitivity and are not good."
B00DVFLJKQ,261,2610,Touch Issues Ruin Experience,RBK,2,-,05-Oct-13,5,3,"I purchased this (not from Amazon) the first week it came out. I returned the first one because it came with a dead pixel out of the box. I've now been using this one for 2 months, and the bottom line is that I wish I had never purchased it. I would gladly take a full refund if I could.

It is a great size. The screen is great. Good weight and fits in the hand well. It feels very snappy generally.

But the typing and touch problems that continue to plague these things ruin what otherwise I think should be the best tablet for the money.

I still have issues with it not registering some taps, or single taps resulting in a long-press action even when I completely remove my fingers from the screen. When I type, regardless of app, there is a lag almost all the time. So if you really hammer away, you don't realize until you're on the next word that it missed a tap earlier and now you have to backspace to go and fix it. It is just painful to type on. I would say bad to awful.

It seems minor, but it ruins the experience enough that I'm finding I'm putting this $270 tablet on the table and grabbing my Galaxy S3 phone. The Galaxy just works, lightning fast, no typing issues. I've used family members Nexus 4 phones and iPad Mini. They're inferior to the Nexus 7 on paper, but you just don't even think about it when you use them. They just work and in general are therefore a pleasure to use. The Nexus 7 is constantly irritating you and bothering you to the point where you just don't want to use it after awhile. For what is mostly a toy for pleasure (pics, videos, reading books or blogs, typing some emails), all the joy and pleasure is taken away any time you need to type with it.

I believe they have released at least 2, if not 3 updates now to help address these issues, but nothing seems to help. I've seen nobody who has had success sending it back to Asus/Google and getting back a perfectly working tablet. I've read of people on their 5th+ tablet and still isn't working correctly. I will change my rating if they can actually permanently erase these problems, but until then, 2 stars....simply because everything but the typing / touch is really pretty darn good. But if I can't recommend it and wish I could just get my money back, even a 3 is too high.

Unless Google / Asus can actually fix these issues, I have to say, save your money or buy something else. The frustration ruins the entire experience regardless of processor specs or screen resolution or size or weight. I want to love it, but its bad enough I feel I have to come here and give my feedback, with the hope others will read this and know what they might be getting into."

Now, this is not as good as Apple's iPads but it's cheaper. Apple is a closed system, and as we know, android is open. Apple pays closer attention to details but Android is getting better and better. You can't compare this with the current Apple iPad Mini until the next model comes out in October. I will have both.
This model has a great screen, good sound, it's light, and is responsive. The camera not as good as Apple's but it will do for video conferencing and using Instagram. I am considering getting the model with the cellphone radio in it, purchase a data plan, and use it as a cellphone with the use of my magicJack account and app. I tested it over wi-fi and the it worked great as a phone.

B00DVFLJKQ,263,2621,"I really like it, but... there is always a but.",Valorus,4,-,29-Jul-13,2,2,"I had the previous version of the Nexus 7 and loved it so much that I bought one for my kids and raved about it so much at work that several of my co-workers bought one based on my glowing reviews and they loved it, too.

Enter the New Nexus 7. I will say that I love this one, too and would have given it a glowing 5 star review if this had been the first one I purchased. With another generation of the device to test against, in my expectations it seems to fall a little short of what I was expecting in regards to it's processing speed and power.

The New Nexus 7 is a gorgeous device. It is slimmer than the previous version by a little, but it feels like a lot. The backing has been replaced with a velvet soft type of material and simply feels really nice to the touch. At times it feels as if it is so soft my fingers holding it might slip and let it fall, but it is just an illusion based on the material used. I am anxious to get a nice case protector on it though.

The glass is silky smooth and the screens looks beyond stunning. My first order of business was to find a 1080p movie and check it out. The video looked really good and the deviced played and scrubbed through the video perfectly. My preferred video player does not yet support Jelly Bean, but it will soon as will be the case with other apps that might not yet be upgraded. Games look amazing as well as all the other apps I've tried.

Placing this device through the tests one thing I did notice was that it does not get nearly as hot under intense graphics as the previous version. Every game I have played run just as good one this version of the Nexus 7 as the previous version.

My only complaint and I will preface this with I'm going to test this 100% as I'm going to load a couple of benchmarking apps on the new and old Nexus in the next few days (co-worker is bringing in the older version as I sold it to them in anticipation for the new one). Having said all that, I was disappointed with the results I saw.

Maybe someone with the first generation Nexus 7 would be so kind as to load the apps ""Windmill"" by Allegorithmic and ""GPU Mark"" by Silicon Studio (both free) and provide the frames per second based on high quality settings and we can compare.

**My Tests

New Nexus 7

GPU Mark : Natural Bone benchmark on high settings averaged about 13 FPS with a score of 13710. The GPU benchmark varied the FPS for each test, but the final score was 7402.

Windmill off screen 720p benchmark yielded an average FPS 25.55 with the next highest fps device being an HTC One (We will see because I just happen to have an HTC One) Read on.

HTC One

GPU Mark : Natural Bone benchmark on high settings averaged about 16 FPS which is about 3 FPS faster than the Nexus 7 and had a score of 16680 which is about 300 points higher than the Nexus 7. The GPU benchmark varied the FPS for the HTC One. The final score for the HTC One was 6559 which was about 1000 points lower.

Windmill off screen 720p benchmark on the HTC One yielded an average FPS 21.61

It would be interesting, however, to actually see the results of the two Nexus 7 tablets as opposed to a tablet and a phone. Even though both are able to run the benchmarking apps at the same resolutions, it is still comparing an apple to an orange.

Bottom line if this is your first Nexus 7 then you are in for a real treat and will absolutely not be disappointed. For me, and maybe I'm just being very unrealistic, I expected it to scream a lot more than it did.

Hope this helped."

B00DVFLJKQ,264,2640,Could be a great device if quality control issues were addressed,David T. Spenard,3,-,07-Dec-13,3,0,"I bought a Nexus 7 32gb tablet after doing about 4 hours of research and following the reviews on Amazon and other sites, but I sent it back and bought a Nook HD 7 16Gb tablet instead. Let me explain why.

Without a doubt, the Nexus 7 is the fastest, sleakest, most useful tablet on the market. But.....but.....but, I believe ASUS has some serious quality control issues. In my case I played around with it for about 6 hours, installing all sorts of applications without issue, then the reboots started happening. I got about 4 of them in 1 hour. So I applied the OS update like many other reviewers recommended. After the update I used it for another 2 hours and then I got a total lockup, and this happened twice in about 15 minutes, so that was it for me.

Fortunately I bought it at Walmart.com because it was cheaper at $229 and because it's no hassle to return it to the store, which is what I did. I should also mention that the other reason I took it back was because I believe the device just doesn't have the durability it needs for a mobile device. I was planning on getting a case for it, but nonetheless, it's very thin and there's no margin for error between the edge of the glass screen and the edge of the device. And I read quite a few reviews where people said they cracked the screen without doing anything rough with it, so that also factored into my decision to return it.

Overall if ASUS can fix their quality control problems and do something about the durability of the device, then this tablet will stay on top as the premier device for people that want a high-performing Android at a reasonable price (when compared to the iPad).

I mentioned that I bought a Nook HD 7 16gb from Barnes & Noble after returning the Nexus, and I couldn't be more pleased. I got it for a great price of $99 for black Friday weekend, and I love it. It's completely compatible with the google play store now, minus a handful of incompatible apps, and you can even install some apps to make it look more like an Android and less like a Nook. I've been using it for about a week now and have had zero issues. It's a great device with an awesome display, performs very well, and looks and feels very durable."

Original Review
This device is an amazing tablet and I would give it 5 stars:
However, many people(including myself) are having issues with the touch screen being erratic, double/triple typing, touching in random places on the screen, etc... Some have replaced their tablet 3 or 4 times and still have the same problem, others replace their tablet and report that the problem goes away completely.

I'm taking mine back because I'm having to correct every other word I type, pinch zoom doesn't always work, and the tablet registers my touches in random places so I have to keep pressing in the same spot until it finally presses where I expect it to.

I used the android app YAMTT(Yet Another Multi Touch Test, is an app that just shows touch events on the screen) to verify the erratic touches.

B00DVFLJKQ,265,2650,GPS is broken on all models - touch screen busted on most,Faunus,1,-,18-Aug-13,23,2,"I have no idea how anyone could give this tablet more than 1 star if they have tried to use the GPS.

Currently, GPS fails while traveling for more than an a half hour. It is all over the news. The device is being returned in waves. The longest my GPS worked was a whole 8 minutes.

I ordered this tablet for GPS navigation. Now, it is the most colorful and expensive brick I've ever owned. I returned mine for a refund. Unfortunately, I bought $40 in accessories for this piece of junk.

Not to mention there is a massive problem with the touch screen. Just google it to see the thousands of posts that have been put up regarding the touch screen and GPS. What is worse? Apparently, bluetooth keyboards are not operating with this tablet correctly.

Do yourself a favor and AVOID this product. I've never had to review a product like this before, but Google and Asus deserve ZERO stars on this one.

UPDATE: So, Google rolled out an update a month after the release of this device. I decided to give the Nexus 7 another shot. It fixed the GPS issues with update JSS15Q, and I have no touchscreen issues. I've also been using a bluetooth keyboard without a problem. See my other product review for that keyboard/case combo.

GPS had a lock today for 8 1/2 hours, without failing. In total, I traveled 52 miles with 2400 feet in elevation change. I didn't use wifi, just the GPS chip.

I can now say the device is more like a 4-star buy. However, google and asus should be ashamed for selling this device a full month before it was ready. Everyone who bought this device for GPS navigation couldn't have been more disappointed. In fact, they took full advantage of us. But what is new when it comes to corporate leverage over the common man in america? Releasing a broken product that doesn't doesn't function... No problem, give us your money and maybe we will get it fixed one day. Scroogle and a$us can still lick muh USB port."
B00DVFLJKQ,266,2651,The tablet I've been waiting for,Croissant,4,-,29-Jul-13,141,19,"The original Nexus 7 tablet was a favorite among many. I made the decision to get a Nexus 7 a few months ago, but decided to wait it out for the new version, and I'm glad I did for the most part. The new Nexus 7 (2013) is better than the old Nexus 7 (2012) in every way, except possibly the material used for the back.

PROS
- Gorgeous 7-inch screen
- Great build quality
- Fast performance
- Latest version of Android (4.3)
- Qi compatible wireless charging
- Solid battery life
- Very thin and light
- Easy to hold one handed
- Stereo speakers

CONS
- Average front and rear cameras
- No microSD card expansion
- Big bezels

DESIGN
The new Nexus 7 is very thin and light. It's lighter than the iPad Mini and almost as thin. The narrow width of the Nexus 7 actually makes it easy to hold one-handed, even for people with small hands. It does have a fairly significant bezel on the top and bottom, when held in portrait mode, but it's no worse than the bezel around the Kindle Fire HD 7"". Presumably, the big bezel helps when gripping the Nexus 7 in landscape mode, so your fingers aren't accidentally tapping on the active screen. The big bezel doesn't bother me in the least, but some people may be bothered by the aesthetics.

The micro-USB port is actually a special dual purpose port called a SlimPort. It allows you to use a special SlimPort HDMI adapter to connect your Nexus 7 to an external display. I actually found it a little hard to tell which way the micro-USB cable plugged in to the port. I have gobs of devices that use micro-USB and this was the first time I wasn't sure which way to plug it in. I eventually figured out that the short end goes toward the back, or just plug the charging cable in to the Nexus 7 with the USB icon facing up.

Speaking of the back, the back of the new Nexus 7 uses a soft-touch material that's common in a lot of devices these days, including the Kindle Fire HD. I don't mind the feel of the material and I actually quite like it in most devices. However, a lot of people really liked the feel of the old Nexus 7's back, which I've heard described as a leather-like driving glove. I've personally never held the old Nexus 7, so I can't say which I prefer.

The only physical buttons on the new Nexus 7 are the power/lock and volume keys, which are located on the upper part of the right side. The 3.5mm headphone jack is located on the top and the previously mentioned micro-USB/SlimPort is located at the bottom of the Nexus 7.

There's a fixed focus 1.2MP camera in the front and a 5MP autofocus camera in the back. Neither are that great, but work OK in a pinch. I would personally prefer a higher quality camera in the front and no camera in the back. Video hangouts and Skype chats over video are so convenient with a tablet, but often lack quality because the cameras are blah. Omitting the camera in the back would also solve a pet peeve of mine: people taking photos and videos in public with their tablets.

The overall build quality of the new Nexus 7 is excellent. The entire tablet feels solid and dense, which makes it feel like a premium piece of gear.

DISPLAY
In my opinion, if you can only have one personal tablet, 7-inch tablets are the best option for most people. 10-inch tablets are great for watching videos, but can be awkward to hold. There's a reason why the Apple iPad Mini is so popular now, despite what Steve Jobs said about smaller tablets. I nearly got the iPad Mini when it was released, but its disappointing screen kept me from plunking down money on the first gen version.

The new Nexus 7's display has 323 ppi (pixels per inch), which makes it currently the sharpest screen available on a tablet -- even better than the retina iPad (4th gen). The screen resolution goes up from 1280 x 800 on the original Nexus 7, to 1920 x 1200 on the 2013 version. There a lot of screen real estate to work with here; I can fit 36 1x1 icons on a single screen.

Text on the new Nexus 7 is extremely sharp and 1080p HD videos look terrific. Colors look accurate and well saturated to my eyes, but I'm certainly not a color expert. Also worth noting is that the glass is made by Corning, but I'm not entirely sure if it's Gorilla Glass. It's just described as ""scratch resistant Corning glass.""

Below are the display specs on some other tablets:

324 ppi iPad Mini 2 2048 x 1536 * rumored
323 ppi Nexus 7 (2013) 1920 x 1200
264 ppi Retina iPad (4th gen) 2048 x 1536
216 ppi Nexus 7 (2012) 1280 x 800
216 ppi Kindle Fire HD 7"" 1280 x 800
189 ppi Samsung Note 8 1280 x 800
163 ppi iPad Mini 1024 x 768

PERFORMANCE
The Nexus 7 (2013) uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro CPU clocked at 1.5GHz and a 400MHz Adreno 320 GPU. Navigating the Nexus 7 is very responsive and peppy. 1080p HD videos I loaded on it played without any stuttering or artifacts and games looked terrific. Riptide GP2 by Vector Unit was heavily demoed during the release of the new Nexus 7, but they have another game called Beach Buggy Blitz (Free) that also does a good job of showing off the Nexus 7's graphics prowess. Of course, continuous run-games like Subway Surfers, Temple Run, Iron Man 3, etc., all load up quickly and run well on the new Nexus 7.

The Wi-Fi card in the new Nexus 7 supports dual-bands and up to 802.11n. It always pains me when I have to put a new device on my 2.4GHz network, so I'm very happy that I can put the new Nexus 7 on my 5GHz network. My connection has been very good and I haven't experienced a single dropout or other wireless connectivity problems.

The new Nexus 7 now has stereo speakers built in, like the Kindle Fire HD. They sound pretty good, but the Kindle Fire HD's speakers still sound better. In noisy environments, however, neither one of them are easy to hear. I still prefer a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, if I'm going to watch a movie or listen to music. I haven't done enough critical listening yet to say whether or not the Fraunhofer Cingo virtual surround sound works, but I haven't been disappointed in the few hours that I've listened to the Nexus 7 using my Logitech UE 6000 headphones.

When I plugged the new Nexus 7 into my PC, Windows 7 recognized it immediately and installed the driver. It showed up as a device and I was able to transfer files back and forth, albeit a little slowly. I should also mention that on the 32GB model, there is 25.57GB of free space available after you're done setting it up and installing the updates.

ANDROID
The new Nexus 7 comes pre-installed with Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean), which is the most current version of Android available. Some of its new features include restricted user profiles, Bluetooth Smart, and OpenGL ES 3.0 (3D graphics). The version of Android 4.3 on a Nexus device like the Nexus 7, is of course, pure Google. Not only does the Nexus 7 not have any third-party skins like HTC's Sense or Samsung's TouchWiz, but it doesn't have any third-party crapware either; it's all Google. The following apps come preloaded on the Nexus 7: Chrome, Gmail, Calendar, Currents, Drive, Earth, Keep, Keyboard, Play Books, Play Magazines, Play Movies & TV, Play Music, Search, Google+, Hangouts, Maps, Street View (Maps), and YouTube.

Android, as a mobile operating system and as an ecosystem, has matured a great deal in a very short amount of time. Android devices are very stable these days, at least those from the major manufacturers. I remember when app force closures were a common occurrence. System hangs and random reboots also happened on a fairly regular basis. But that's just not the case anymore. Google, hardware makers, and app developers, have all done a great job in making Android an amazing ecosystem well worth investing in. And if you want that pure Google experience, there's no better way to get it than from a Nexus device. The only drawback, for now, is that developers still aren't very quick to optimize their apps for tablets, but that's certainly been improving.

BATTERY
The new Nexus 7 has a 3950 mAh battery, which is rated at about nine hours of ""active use."" It also has built-in support for wireless charging via Qi-compatible chargers, like the Nexus 4's wireless charger. From my own observations, it seems like I can easily go a full day with heavy use, or a few days with casual use.

CONCLUSION
Hardware-wise, the Nexus 7 is absolutely the best small tablet available right now. Its screen quality, performance, and build quality are all top notch. Its size makes it very easy to hold, even one-handed, and is great for reading, checking emails, watching videos, and playing games. It's also running the latest version of Android, so you get the most advanced and feature-rich version of Android yet. If you're looking for a small tablet right now, the new Nexus 7 (2013) has to be at the top of your list. Other small tablets I'd recommend considering are the iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0, Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0, Kindle Fire HD 7"", and the old Nexus 7 (2012). But if I'm being honest here, the one I'm really recommending is the new Nexus 7 (2013)."
B00DVFLJKQ,266,2652,Nice screen but clunky interface,Luckywales,3,-,10-Sep-13,3,0,"Bought this with a 20% coupon at Office Max, so it was a deal too good to pass up. I had wanted to experience the Android world since, to this point, I had owned one iPhone and an iPad.

Some things I really liked:
- If you're used to the way you store things on a PC, then you'll like this. Unlike Apple iOS, you can actually see the files you want in folders, and move them between folders - there are folders for Videos, Photos, Documents and Downloads, etc. If you want a file on it, you just plug in the device and it shows up as an additional drive, and you copy the file into the associated folder - easy.
- Playing video files. The screen really is beautiful, and it will play almost any file that you download, or copy to the device. Apple iOS ruins this for people. You have to convert the file to a compatible format, and then use iTunes to place it ""correctly"" on the device. Of course, if you're not near your iTunes account/computer, this is a pain in the a**.
- If you're a Google user - every service offered is seamlessly integrated, from Gmail, to contacts, Google Voice, and Play - which I use to store all of my music on the cloud.

Some things I really didn't like:
- It's clunky - nowhere near as smooth to operate as any iOS device. Maybe that's because it's more flexible...I don't know, but it's jerky and the touch screen doesn't seem as precise as an interface.
- The icons on the device are low quality. Apple icons simply look better, in my opinion.

I realize that, given its price point, it may not even be in direct competition with Apple, but realistically I'm not going to buy two 7-inch tablets. This is good value for its money, an does some things very well, but don't expect the ""polish"" that you get from Apple products."

Performance is lagless and the screen outperforms that of my brother's iPad 4.

The patch did fix the problem, it has been a great tablet ever since.

[Previous review]

There are hundreds of nexus 7 owners reporting the same thing. Google ""nexus 7 2013 gps"" to see other reports.

GPS will work for a few minutes after rebooting, but will eventually fail.

If you do not use GPS much you may not notice this issue becuase it will work occasionally after a reboot.

Use the ""GPS Test"" app that can be downloaded from the play store.

Google and ASUS are pretending there is no problem.

I will refrain from returning the unit until the end of my return period in case it is a software issue that it fixed before then.

If the GPS worked, I would give the Nexus 7 2013 5 stars. Everything else is great.

I retired from long haul trucking to a local transit job back in 1992 which allowed more freedom to do nothing. A female friend introduced me to a device called a computer and my life changed forever. I started surfing the internet when it was a black screen with white lettering, we didn't refer to it as the internet than we refereed to it as an ""Bulletin Board"". Although http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) really make it standout over conventional ""Bulletin Boards"" it is still basically a bulletin board.

A couple of years later another little start-up dot com was looking for beta testers so I volunteered again. That little company is now know as Google. I've been a Google-er ever since. There isn't a Google product I haven't tried, and without exception; I love all of them. They don't make a bad product, sometimes in the mass production of one of their products by an organization that was contracted to mass produce it; there is a glitch. It is not the fault of Google!

Anyone old enough to utilize commonsense should know that anytime something is mass produced there are going to be glitch in few of the parts.

DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!"
B00DVFLJKQ,268,2674,Word to the Wise,David M. Wenning,1,-,07-Aug-14,2,1,"I have a first generation Nexus 7. I moved up to it from an iPod Touch. I preordered it the day after it was announced based on all the glowing reviews so I probably have one of the first devices shipped. I was really pleased with it, delighted in fact. It was fast, and responsive, a great little tablet. I was recommending it to everyone.

Then they updated the OS from ""Jelly Bean"" to ""Kit Kat."" Kit Kat, that silly moniker should have been a clue of what was to come. The OS update to 4.4.1 totally destroyed the tablet. After a short time another update to 4.4.2 didn't help at all. Everything is now incredibly slow and unresponsive. Every app begins with a pause, followed by a delay. If I try to do things too quickly, it crashes. The Chrome browser is excruciatingly slow. It pretty much just ignores you. They keep adding ridiculous and useless features to it. For example, if you close a tab, a banner opens to say you just closed a tab. Using this thing has become an exercise in frustration tolerance.

What is also irritating me is Google's total silence on the issue. There is some rather complicated fixes that will revert the Gen1 devices back to the previous OS. It involves factory resetting and rooting around in the bowels of the thing that seems a bit risky to me. I don't understand why it is our problem to fix this issue and not Google's.

Apparently the later models (Gen2) work fine with the new OS. I am not ready to say that Google purposely sabotaged this thing as a ploy to get people to buy new ones. Frankly, I will never buy another one based on this experience. I would never recommend the tablet to anyone ever again. If my experience is anything to go by, I would be vary wary of any future OS updates. There is another update now that I am refusing to install. Reports indicate that the devices lose all wifi with this update. See what I mean?

I am also disappointed with Android apps in general. Most seem mediocre at best. For example, there is no decent tide app available, at least nothing to compare to iOS. Very few seem to have paid versions to eliminate the ads, and the ads are pretty cheesy. I simply refuse to sit through a video ad in order to play a game of spider solitaire.

Another problem with Android apps is an apparent compulsion to keep updating them unnecessarily by the developers. They take a good app and mess with it until it becomes unusable. They destroyed the Google+ app to the point I just quit visiting. I don't know what Evernote just did, but they have rendered it useless and a waste of time. You can't even open it any more. It just saves everything to the default notebook, whether you want that or not. Twitter's app has also been pretty much ruined by the automatic refreshing. If you open a tweet, look at a photo or follow a link, the thing automatically refreshes your stream. Then you must scroll, scroll, scroll to find where you left off. It's just a total pain to use now. I tried other Twitter clients, but none where any good.

Now I am just waiting for the new iPad Minis to come out. Then I am going to see how far I can Frisbee this thing into the bay."

I honestly have to say that it blows my iPad mini out of the water in nearly every category. The only issues I've had were with badly designed apps. The tablet is phenomenal and better than anything I have used so far. I have owned two iPads, a Kindle Fire, and an Android 2.3 tablet. This is by far the best I've used. Android 4.3 is brilliant. Highly recommended by me.

Real problem is not the tablet but Asus warranty/support. Not only won't they fix the thing, their repair costs like $170 !!! So basically if you own it, you own a disposable product according to Asus !

Only buy it with a damage warranty like Square Trade and likely should have an Otter Box case. I would suggest you add the unit cost, the warranty and case costs to determine what you're paying for this tablet and make your buying decision at that price point."

I thought it was a good product...up to the point that I had the misfortune of trying to get it repaired by ASUS, the manufacturer. The experience was unbelievably terrible.

I had to make multiple calls to ASUS in my attempt to get the tablet repaired. I was doubtful it would be worth it, but hesitatingly changed my mind after I called ASUS support and was told the repair would be $150, including shipping. That was just cheap enough to justify going ahead with it. The first representative quoted me the price -- -- but attempted to put me on hold and dropped my call. On my second call, I received an identical quote from a different support person ($150 to repair the product, including labor and shipping.) I asked explicitly if that would be the total cost -- it was not much less than the cost of a new tablet -- and I was told ""yes, it would be."" I was issued an RMA. After I shipped the unit to ASUS (at my cost) I waited over a month before receiving any confirmation. This came in the form of an invoice by email that was much higher than the repair cost I was given over the phone. The new quote included tax, shipping and labor charges. (The California sales tax was added to the part PLUS the repair charges, even though labor to repair an item isn't subject to CA sales tax). The total came out to about $200, 33 percent higher than what I was told on the phone, and almost identical to the price of a brand new Nexus.

I sent an email reply to ASUS to complain, but it was ignored. After several more weeks, I was sent notice that the product was being returned to me for non-payment of the repair invoice. In all, this process took more than two months, with nothing to show for my trouble but a shipping expense.

This was terrible service on every level: slow, misleading and unfairly priced (sales tax doesn't apply to repair labor in California). I actually liked the Nexus 7 product, before I broke it, but considering the horrible ASUS customer support, I will not replace it with another one."

Almost everyone who has purchased the Nexus 7 and tried to use GPS for navigating has found the tablet cannot lock onto a signal. Google acknowledged this problem after release, but has yet to provide an update whether they think it can be patched (software) or not (hardware).

Many early adopters including myself have been mistakenly fed the same line by Google AND Asus tech support that""GPS does not work without wifi"". This is in stark contrast to the first generation Nexus 7, all Samsung Galaxy Tabs, and most recent smart phones which can access GPS for navigation WITHOUT any kind of wi-fi or cellular data connection.

If you are looking to buy this tablet, please be aware that the GPS will NOT work out of the box. More importantly, there is a strong possibility Google/Asus will deny the problem and not do anything about it."

B00DVFLJKQ,271,2705,1080 display is amazing,LazyTechBoi,5,-,27-Jul-13,6,0,"I went to best buy yesterday just to pre-order and was shocked to see that they were selling it early and there was only one 32gb left so I purchased it prematurely. I originally had the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 because the Samsung tab 3 7.0 is a joke... anyway I returned the galaxy tab assuming I was getting a better deal and I was .... better specs, better display 1920 x 1200. Best on the market with 323 pixels per inch It has the same processor as the galaxy but for some reason this Nexus 7 is extremely more smoother than the galaxy with no lag at all. It's super responsive, jet fast and it has the latest Android operating system 4.3... winning. Not to mention the price point is wallet wise and cheaper. More bang for your buck.

Cons
No memory card slot so I suggest going with the 32GB model. 7"" is a little small, I would have loved 8"" or 8.5"" especially since there's no physical buttons, only touch capacitive keys which occupy some screen reservation. The last con is the sound. It's not the best, very disappointing where I feel it has to be something wrong.... but I'm not sure if it's my device so I'm going to test another model before I give that verdict. And if so I'll have to do a even exchange once they get more in stock.

Overall
Compared to the galaxy tab 3 by Samsung, its direct competitor, it kills the 7.0 version. Where you have a dog fight is the 8.0 model. They both have their good and bad points but I would personally go with the nexus at the moment even if it turns out that the sound quality is as terrible as it appears to be ,I hope not though..."

B00DVFLJKQ,271,2710,Hisense Sero Pro 7 inch tablet GPS cheaper and GPS actually works.,John H. Zouck,3,-,25-Nov-13,2,0,"I bought a nexus 7 in late August to take on a trip to Spain, replacing my 10 inch Lenovo K1, which was orphaned within 6 months of my purchasing it. One of my main requirements was that its GPS work, and work well, since I planned to use it to navigate the El Camino using citymaps2go and the free OSMAND.org map app, both of which worked off-line (unlike Google maps.)

I could never get the GPS to work reliably, and after going online found hundreds of posts relating to just this problem. WIthin 2 days I returned the tablet, having been unsuccessful in downloading an update that fixed the problem. It appeared no other user had done so either.

Instead, on a suggestion from a user who was in the GPS discussion, I bought a WalMart Hisense Sero 7 pro. It was $100 less expensive, and the GPS worked perfectly out of the box. It is slightly heavier and thicker, but has plenty of battery life, cameras, good screen, and can be broken or lost without breaking the bank. After the trip, during which it worked perfectly, I noticed one slight problem with one horizontal display line failing right where the bottom menu starts, but it was unnoticeable in most circumstances. I sent it back for repair and will report back when and if it gets returned.

Update: the unit was returned working perfectly within 1-2 weeks, and they had made sure to return the microSD card I had inadvertently left in. I'm very satisfied with the service!"
B00DVFLJKQ,272,2711,Returning the Nexus 7 32GB 2013 model,The Big Picture,1,-,19-Aug-13,92,8,"I purchased one of the Nexus 7 32GB 2013 models from a local Stapler store last week. Long story short, I'm returning it later today while I still am within the 14-day time frame for being able to do so.

From the start it proved to be a problem device. I did the OS upgrade to Jelly Bean 4.3 shortly after initial setup. Then the various problems began... At first it would not install previously paid apps from the Google Play Store (apps had been originally purchased for use on my Samsung Galaxy S3) - the apps would download but on ""installing"" I repeatedly got error code -24. I called Google Support, and other than basic scripted troubleshooting, they had no fix or suggestions other than to say I should get in touch with the developers (what are the odds of this being a developer issue??).

I also began to encounter problems with the Nexus booting up - about half the time it would hang and I'd have to hard reset. Not a good sign.

I decided to work with the numerous apps that did function (and I was able to buy and install *new* apps from the Play store just fine). After several hours of tweaking, adding passwords etc., I received an system error message that the ""Launcher"" has stopped working. All my effort was lost in setting up the tablet to look the way I liked. The Launcher is the software that manages the icons, folders, etc.

Similarly, I started to get a message that the setup function wasn't working (had crashed). After power cycling, and experiencing the difficulties in booting again and again, I called Google Support back and we decided to do a ""factory reset.""

I then again spent time setting up the tablet. This time, though, I WAS able to install the paid apps that I'd previously received the -24 error code about. Likely this was due to the firmware having now been upgraded previously (long story short). However, I then started to have problems powering on (booting up) again. The unit would just hang on the animated ""X"" that displays during the boot process. So, again, another factory reset. etc. etc. It reached a point where the Nexus would not boot at all. I then called Asus (the hardware manufacturer) and determined that there is likely a ""software"" problem (meaning the 4.3 version Android operating system) in their view. There is no current verified solution. There is a 5.x Android OS on the unspecified horizon, per Asus...

My overall experience: when the thing is working, it looks great, is speedy and has a lot of capability. Unfortunately, in my experience, it was not working very often, was unstable and ultimately unreliable.

It seems to me that this product was released without sufficient real-world testing. By ""product,"" I refer to the hardware, firmware and software, including updates. If you search online, you'll find quite a number of users are encountering difficulties with the 2013 version of the Nexus 7, including screen/touch issues, GPS issues when away from wifi, random rebooting, inability to boot, and other problems.

I really wanted to like this device, but the quality isn't there yet. By ""quality,"" I'm referring to the interactive functional mix of hardware, firmware, Android OS, core apps/OS setup, and Google Play Store.

From conversations with Asus and Google support reps, what I've heard is that they're basically ""aware"" of the issues, but there are no solutions at hand for those who have a cranky Nexus 7 Gen2, as per above. I don't know how widespread the issues I cited are; just on Amazon, there's a fair percentage of one and two star ratings overall. It seems that some users are having success with their N7's (which is fortunate for them); sadly, that was not the case here."

B00DVFLJKQ,273,2722,The new TABLET Generation....,hypercat77,4,-,11-Aug-13,2,2,"For several months ive been reviewing many online tablets and specs before buying my first tablet, but currently, after having seen many online, ive not yet found or seen any that are attractive enough of practical features for me. A few of the features on many tablets are ones i either dont want or need, but most features are ones i do....

Instead of focusing on the new Nexus 7 FHD or any other tablet, here below is my LIST OF IMPORTANT TABLET FEATURES that i believe are generally the most practical and desirable features (among others not mentioned below) that should be included on ALL tablets priced near or over $200....hopefully some DESIGN folks at the tablet manufacturers also read it....
_________________________________________________________

SHAPE & DESIGN : Among the most practically shaped and attractively designed tablets currently available, the Asus Nexus 7 FHD looks and feels the best to me, and i especially like the smooth, black rubberized-texture on the reverse side for better grip, its non-glossy matte-like appearance and resistance to fingerprints....

SIZE : Im a proponent of SMALLER-IS-BETTER technology, and the smaller the tablet is (while retaining a minimum 7"" screen size), the better and more practical it is for PORTABILITY....Hopefully, the coming full-featured BI-FOLD and TRI-FOLD tablets will be available soon enough, enabling folding (shirt-pocket size) 7-9"" screen tablets nearly as small as (and much thinner than) a cigarette pack !....But oddly, the new N7 FHD is actually LONGER than the old N7.

Also, the width of the side (and especially top /bottom) BEZELS of the best current tablets are just TOO WIDE, which are NOT even necessary technically (many smartphones, being even smaller than tablets, have just as much inside-tech, but much narrower bezels), nor even necessary for comfortable /adequate hold and view of the unit, but just make the unit LARGER and HEAVIER. So i (and most others, i believe) hopefully anticipate that NARROWER-bezel tablets will arrive SOON (....if bi-fold and tri-fold tablets are longer delayed).

PROCESSOR : For the multi-tasker (the majority of tablet users, i believe), it should have a QUAD-core processor at the least, for fast and multi-app operations, because even DUAL-core tablets are, evidently and apparently, TOO SLOW for it !

DATA CARD PORT : This is a MUST-HAVE portability feature for most ON-THE-GO tablet users, because storing large amounts of music, media and data on a memory card for them is NOT an ""option"" but a practical necessity.

LONG-LASTING BATTERY : At least 10 hours of all-day multi-purpose use should be provided by a REMOVABLE battery, and a few RE-SETTABLE power-use options should be available in ""Settings"".

SYSTEM DEFAULTS : ALL user-function defaults of the browser NEED to be RE-SETTABLE by the user, as needed or desired.

HI-RES CAMERA : The current practical MINIMUM resolution for high-end smartphones is 8-megapixels (just barely enough to capture the license plate of that car that just scraped yours and sped away), and so ALL TABLETS near or over $200 should NOT have less than that, and should also include high-quality image stabilization.

GPS NAVIGATION : Another MUST-HAVE for most mobile users, this should be a STANDARD feature on all tablets, and should also have constant and excellent signal reception.

B00DVFLJKQ,273,2725,One of the worst tablet available - buy something else,Cdub,1,-,30-Nov-13,7,2,"One of the worst tablets available

The Google Nexus7 has some good features. The battery life, the screen resolution are two.

However, the issues that renders productivity null gives this tablet a 'no buy' recommendation. You have no doubt heard of the buggy keyboard that randomly switches from alpha to numeric to symbols? Well the problem still exist. Browsing the internet, the connection is snappy. However, the screens occasionally zooms and locks - forcing you to continually hit your screen hoping for it to zoom out or you have to refresh the screen. One or twice is an annoyance. Three or more is an issue.

The other issues are the native email apps. These are truly the worst available email apps. My Samsung and iPhone email apps do a better job by far. Basic features such as sort is missing. This cuts down on productivity if you receive more than one email per day or have more than one email address. Note that the delete function does not work when using the search function. What happens is the emails appears to delete with a system note, but when you exit search the emails are still there. These are some of the few annoying issues that plague this tablet. I can attest that my wife does not experience any of these issues with her apple tablet."
B00DVFLJKQ,273,2726,easy to crack screen,Ocean State Prime,2,-,22-Jan-14,-,3,"Didn't buy it on Amazon, but did get a Nexus 7 for my daughter. Less than a month later it is dead. She dropped it in a parking lot and the screen cracked, single crack width-wise across the device. Now all screen touches torque the crack and are unintelligible to the device. It is useless. She's only 11, so the fall was only 3 feet or so. Although I wasn't happy to see the device dropped, I didn't expect it to become inoperable. I think these devices are too fragile.

And ASUS will not repair it blaming the defects on the user without actually looking at and or admitting their is a defect and problem! I guess I will have to take a second look at the new Samsung or heaven forbid the apple mini since ASUS and other competitive makers settle for making crap with no or very rude bull headed service to replace their defective devices!

B00DVFLJKQ,274,2734,"Great little tablet, again. Recommended.",Jindo Fox,5,-,26-Jul-13,105,4,"I was a fan of the size and features of the original Nexus 7, so I stepped out to get one of the new models today. I wanted to see how the app and data synchronization works between two devices, and I'm likely going to gift the old one to my young daughter. Let's call the new device Nexus 7 (B) to differentiate it, since neither Google nor Asus has given it a new name.

The packaging is a nice slip-on gift box as you'd expect from this kind of device, with a splash of blue to differentiate it from Apple or Amazon tablets. First impressions as it comes out of the box are positive. Nexus 7 (B) is black-on-black-on-black: the power/volume buttons are black, the logos are black, the (slim, between the size of iPhone cube and iPad bricklet, very short cord) charger is black, the bezel is black, and the holes for the cameras (back and front, more on them later) are black. It's like, how much more black could this be? And the answer is none. None more black. (Apologies to Nigel Tufnel, but it's true).

It makes the ""old"" (2012) Nexus 7 look like a tacky cheese ball when placed side by side. The silvery painted-plastic trim on the old one (all nicked and pitted in my case) is not missed at all. The new device is slimmer and flatter (no curved back) than the original. The rubbery backing is smooth, not ""Steve McQueen Driving Gloves"" texture like the original, but still pleasant to the touch and solid feeling. The front is a fingerprint magnet as you'd expect, like any black glass screen, but you won't notice when the screen is on. There are pinholes for stereo speakers in the back, at either end of the device, which sound fine for their size (audiophiles will use headphones, I presume).

Nexus 7 (B) ships with Android 4.3 out of the box, with a few tiny service updates to make you reboot after assigning a Google profile to the device. The default start screen comes with Chrome, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, Hangouts, and the new-to-Nexus 7- Camera app in the bottom dock. A shortcut to Google Play (App Store) is on the first page, along with a folder for shortcuts to Google apps for music, books, movies, magazines, photos, G+ (Facebook wannabe), Keep (Evernote wannabe), calendar, Currents (news magazine), gallery (formerly known as Picasa), and People (contacts).

Google Sync pulled my installed apps from their store, including additional data, upon first launch. Unlike Apple's iCloud backups, not everything is synchronized and backed up. I had to enter lots of third-party passwords to get going, and all my downloads in other folders were not carried over. If you live more or less exclusively in Google's world, they've taken care of you, but otherwise, you'll need to look after your own backups. I'll need to install Amazon's App Store and my Humble Bundle apps separately. No big deal, but be prepared for some file transfers if you think outside the Google box.

The screen is qualitatively ""nicer"" than the original Nexus screen, with blacks being more black and text looking as Retina (no pixels) as I could imagine. I haven't received the over-the-air update for 4.3 on my original unit, so I can't tell if subpixel rendering is better on the old screen, but side by side the new one is clearly superior. It's probably not enough of a difference to upgrade if you're happy with the current one, but after some time with the new screen, going back to the old one could be more noticeable. Think Retina iPad vs. iPad Mini (though the original Nexus screen resolution is better than iPad Mini in my opinion).

What's missing, besides that nasty silver plastic bezel? The pogo pins (which allow for zero-friction placement on a horizontal dock, for charging and audio output) are gone. To make up for that loss, Nexus 7 (B) includes a rear-facing camera. Like many early mobile phone cameras, it's better than nothing but far inferior to what is possible. It looks to be about on par with the rear camera in the iPad 3, and shares the same megapixel count. There's no flash and the image is noisy, even in the preview screen. You're not buying this for the camera. There's also a low-quality camera in the front of the unit for videoconferencing with Google Hangouts. This time around, it's offset to the right the top center, so you can use it in landscape orientation.

There is no SD card support. Also unsupported: Adobe Flash, floppy disks, slide-out keyboard, removable battery. It's a wonderful, inexpensive personal handheld computer, not a genie that wants to grant every wish you might have. These ""limitations"" are fine with me.

Performance is super snappy, the way you want it to be. I'm always skeptical of judging how fast a computer system ""feels"" on first boot, before I've bogged it down with all my software and files. The technical benchmarks (which you can read elsewhere), particularly memory and input-output speeds, make me think that this snappiness will stay around, even once I've made this my own. Mobile Chrome, the slowest dog aspect of the original Nexus, is finally a pleasure to use here, just as it is on the desktop. Library apps like Kindle or Comixology respond instantly, without the heavy lag as felt on the old Nexus. Networking feels faster too, but that's probably because of the faster internal read-write workings. File copies over USB are terrible as always, you're generally better off using Dropbox plus Astro File Manager to move things around.

One of my favorite features of the Google Play store is their selection of video games. They have a lot of the same high-end, 3D-intensive titles as the Apple App Store, like Grand Theft Auto, Galaxy on Fire, and Riptide GP. All of these and more run perfectly on the Nexus 7 (B), as you'd expect, despite the absence of an Nvidia Tegra chip inside. Where the Google store shines is in the red-light district that Apple's App Store avoids: emulation. You can get an emulator for many different obsolete-but-classic home computers and video game consoles in the Google Play store. Playing Super Nintendo games with a glass touchscreen might not seem like fun, but you can add Bluetooth game controllers and keyboards to the Nexus to make it into many little computers in one. This feature is just as good on the Nexus 7 (B). DOSBox Turbo is showing that the CPU governor is in ""ondemand"" mode, which means better battery life for you but that I will need to wait for new software to enjoy TIE Fighter on the go. I am and edge case as far as that is concerned. Everything else seems to run very well, and the store software will likely be updated to optimize for this device.

I really like this tablet. Compared to some of the competition, it's limited (not as many apps as Apple), but its nice little size and price make up for it. Almost all of the ""neutral"" web services that work everywhere, like Feedly, Kindle, Dropbox, Pocket, Facebook, Tumblr, Flipboard, and so on work just as well in Android as they do in iOS. The physical aspect is very pleasant, both to the eye and in the hand. The screen is top-notch, the store is excellent, and the price is right. Recommended."

this is the first android device I ever owned and it will be the last one.
i used to play with my friend's andoid phone a lot YEARS AGO and they were working fine.
but my brand new nexus 7 is so slow and the touch screen precision is so terrible.
iphone, ipad can easily read my fingers but nexus 7 failed so many times even though i tried stylus as well.
and the newly installed apps are terrible too...
the image quality... the UI design... the respond speed...

another problem is: the screen, at least once per day, will lock itself when you ARE USING it. and you can't unlock the screen simply as it's will lock right after it. so your nexus 7 is like blinking for 10 sec. and you come back in 5 mins, then you finally manage to unlock and start using it.

Pros:
+Beautiful vibrant screen (1920x1200) means hello 1080P HD movies and videos
+2GB ram for multi-tasking and general snappiness
+Loads of sensors (GPS, Bluetooth [4.0 for all the new low power devices like Jawbone Ups and Fitbits], NFC)
+Lightweight and portable -- bring it anywhere and everywhere (planes, trains, automobiles). Lighter than last years model.
+Great quality front & rear cameras (though don't look like a major fool and hold the nexus 7 overhead to use the camera to record at public events...you know what I'm talking about)
+Almost full day battery life for most people (specs @ 10 hrs.)
+HDMI out. Watch movies, videos, etc. on the big screen. Awesome!
+4G data available (LTE)

Cons:
+No expandable memory -- we get it, we can use cloud storage (google music, google drive), but there are some times when you want to have a whole bunch of media/games on hand, like say a long international flight
+Lingering build quality concerns based off problems that some users had with original Nexus 7 model

Recommendations:
If you are an early adopter, you probably bought this...
If you have last years model, you'll see benefits from the better screen, hdmi out and performance, so it's probably worth the upgrade (caveat: wait if you're on the fence due to the build quality)

B00DVFLJKQ,277,2764,Expected More,Andy Ngo,4,-,26-Jul-13,25,5,"I just recently got my nexus 7, so for me to write a full review is not really fair but let me give my first impressions since this product is new and people would like a fresh perspective before buying one.

I am quite the android enthusiast. I have only used android smartphones and I have had the first galaxy tab from Samsung so I know a little about how the interface is and I know what irks me about the interface. Since I only got this today I can only give a preliminary review.

I bought this device for school, mostly to carry my textbooks and read some book through Amazon's kindle app. It works brilliantly for that, the compactness makes it very easy to carry around. The battery life is adequate but from my usage of it, the battery seems to drain rather quickly. As I understand it, the battery in this second gen nexus 7 has a smaller battery than the first one, but that can be accounted for by the reduction in weight and the new nexus being slightly, but noticeably, smaller than its predecessor.
The display is what attracted me most to this device, but this could be its weakest point also. There is something about the display that makes Youtube and Netflix feel a little strange. It could be the aspect ratio but I'm not sure about that. Like almost every smartphone/tablet, this thing is a finger magnet. I don't think it's fair to rate this product down for that since almost every smartphone/tablet has that problem, so I won't rate it down because of that. The size of the display is wonderful if you're looking for something small and portable. The 10.1 inch display on my Galaxy Tab was a bit too big for me to carry around everywhere. This 7 inch display is perfect for my purposes and works like it should.

I think this is one of those products that you should definitely try before you actually buy though. I am a android enthusiast so I have gotten used to the interface rather quickly. Other people who have used apple products or windows products may not like the interface as much, but I have gotten used to it. The interface is not without its flaws, but I'm sure developers will be coming out with new ROMs that will remedy the flaws. For this price point, it is difficult to find anything better. I have used Amazon's tablet before, but I personally prefer the Nexus to that. Kind of sucks that Amazon has prevented android users from using the Instant Video feature, but I'm sure work-a-rounds are already going to be coming out for this device in due time. If you're looking for a tablet to use for college and travel, this may be the tablet for you.

**This review is for the WIFI only 32GB Second Generation Nexus 7. If you're looking for the LTE version, that will be coming out in a couple weeks for 350.

**I know someone is going to bring up this issue so I'll address it before I post this review. The previous Nexus 7 did not have a microSD slot, so why are people complaining about that? You should have seen that coming, and for this price point it cannot be expected. If you need more space go for the 32GB like I did. And Also, the available space you can use for a 32GB is a little over 26 GB. This is probably due to some of the drive being used for the Android interface and some of it being taken from just being formatted. If you've ever formatted a computer you know exactly what I'm talking about.

July 28, 2013 Update: Ok I got a lot more time to play with this tablet and I have seen a couple of problems. On occasion it will freeze up on me and then continue. I have a tendency of pushing my devices by downloading multiple apps and doing other things at the same time, but I find it weird how it still freezes with a quad core processor. The screen still irks me a little. Netflix doesn't look quite like it should, it feels a little strange to me. Also I have noticed something strange. My speaker has some static at lower volumes. At higher volumes I can't hear the static since whatever I am playing usually drowns it out. I don't know if this problem only lies with my nexus, but I am just reporting my experience. I may return my nexus if no new software updates remedy this within the next 30 days. It could be hardware, I don't know. It doesn't appear that anyone else has this problem.

For those who wanted to use this tablet as a player for your downloaded video, you probably will not be able to unless you convert your files. I have 720p mkv movies and tv shows and it does not appear that I am able to play any of them with audio and video. There are apps such as MX player or bs player that will enable me to look at the video, but there's not audio playing with it. I have heard about this happening around all Jelly Bean phones and since 4.3 just came out, it looks like an app update might be a long ways away. If I could, I would turn my rating to a 3.5 at this point, but Amazon doesn't allow for that, so I'll keep it at 4 stars for now."

After playing with this new nexus 7 version, it left me frustrated as hell. The touch screen is simply awful. The response is hit or miss when you touch the screen....mostly miss.

B00DVFLJKQ,277,2768,This is just an useless item which he just pay for it,Martha Tejada,1,-,19-Dec-14,-,0,"My friend just purchase this Nexus Tablet from this specific seller and when he got home, followed the instructions on charging the Tablet for 2 hours or so. After that, the tablet never turned on. This is just an useless item which he just pay for it. After speaking to the Customer Care, they didn't provide any kind of solution to return the item or just simply refund his money back.

Kind of frustrating experience I guess. Now, at least I have a reference on not purchasing this kind of product for my personal use ( or for a gift which it was my friend's intention )

Nope - we gave them chances with two prior tablet products ... now they want us to get the ""latest & greatest"" ... because they fail to support prior chip sets that are only 18months old? Nope. Other manufacturers do a WAY better job at not forcing their earlier products to become antiques. We contacted their support people to find if we could at LEAST get 36 months of hardware updates.

The guy from Google said he'd email me the support number for Asus, but I haven't gotten anything yet. Apparently, if you didn't buy it directly from Google it's not their problem and I got mine from Office Depot, not some fly by night, unauthorized retailer. Something to think about before you buy any Nexus tablet. Personally, I loved having a tablet so I'm trying to decide whether I want one of the new Kindle Fires or a Samsung Galaxy."

If you want to do other things on a tablet as in play games or check weather or use any other app then buy something else. Most apps don't run on this tablet and the ones that do crash like nobody's business.

I would advise that if you are looking for a tablet for work, this is a good one. You can check gmail or Google+ no problem. If you are looking for a tablet for fun then buy something else."

The deal breaker for the return was horrible screen response with my bamboo stylus. Press and press and half the time no response. Finger touch is fine but I never had a problem with a stylus on Gen-1 N7 or Samsung tablets. It's faster in benchmarks but you won't see the difference in typical use. Issues with some apps (titanium backup, MX player, ES file manager) but I'm sure app updates will come. Video playback was worse than Gen-1, most likely because MX player will not load in jellybean 4.3 and Gen-1 tegra3 has a hardware decoder onboard. Glad Amazon has easy returns as mine is going back."
B00DVFLJKQ,278,2777,Don't wast your money,Stephen,1,-,19-Dec-13,1,0,I got my wife a nexus 7 she used it less then 10 hours . contacted Google the thing was less then a month out of WARRANTY! They did not want to know anything. JUNK

My office uses google docs so I thought the Nexus 7 might have better google docs integration since it is a google product. I also wanted to save a few $$. My first impression was more negative than positive. I liked the form factor, look feel etc... but I was used to apple products so it wasn't that intuitive to me. I thought I need to give it time and learn the new OS. One thing I didn't like was the battery life. I could not get more than 1 day out of the battery life even with low use. I tried all of the advice from their website but battery life never improved.

After several months of use I must prefer the apple OS. More intuitive for me. The one thing that is inexcusable is the battery life. Within the last month the battery life has gotten worse. I get 2 to 3 hours max. This makes the device unusable for work. I have spent the last hour and a half trying to figure out how to get service. The entire service process is terrible. Very convoluted like they have a goal to discourage service requests by making the process hard to figure out and slow."

Searched the whole internet and nobody can answer the question. And at the top right it has options for open tabs but NOTHING for closing all tabs; Google is not a smart enough company to have thought that maybe just maybe they could put a Close all Tabs option somewhere. Now I have about 100 tabs open that I don't want open!! THEY ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT HITTING A TINY X ON EACH TAB WOULD CAUSE THEM TO CLOSE?? HEY GOOGLE- IT DOESN'T WORK, YOU ARE INCOMPETENT, YOU CAN'T MAKE THE SIMPLIEST OPTION AVAILABLE. Why?? And also the touch screen is garbage- you have to hit everything 10 times for it to react to you.
THE NEW GOOGLE NEXUS 7- A LESSON IN FRUSTRATION!! TABLETS ARE FOR DUMMIES ANYWAY. NO USB ports anywhere, No instructions, no manual, no disc drives. I'll go back to a laptop. Android is horrible too. Nobody on here can close a tab in Chrome either! For sale brand new Nexus 7."
B00DVFLJKQ,279,2781,Cant really review it. *updated*,Alex B,4,Yes,27-Jul-13,8,2,"Tablet came and touch screen would barely respond. Not surprised since when I ordered the original nexus that came with a problem too. Now it says 3 to 4 weeks to ship. Looks like im off to stores to see if they have one. Love Google but im starting to think ASUS is garbage.

Update
So I was able to pick up a working 32gb tablet up from a blue and yellow store I hate going to and I can finally say if u get a working one it is a fantastic tablet. The screen is gorgeous and its very quick and responsive. I've noticed a lot of games I've bought are not yet compatible with the tablet yet. Games like asphalt adrenalin 6 work but the screen resolution is screwed up where Simpsons Tapped out look great but seem to be more zoomed in than my old nexus or s3. I'm going to assume these issues may be worked out and there is always some new adapter problems with any device.

The thinner width makes it harder to hold for me than the old nexus. Maybe when I get a cruzerlite case that will work itself out.

Still I think its the best tablet for the best price."

B00DVFLJKQ,279,2783,Failed during setup,A Hamilton,1,-,28-Jul-13,14,2,"Wanted to purchase this from Amazon but needed it ASAP for a family member's gift. Bought it at BB, very excited to get it home after so many positive reviews around the net and YouTube, etc. Opened the box. No Owner's Manual, no ""Quick Start"" guide as mentioned in the Warranty/Safety Guide. Looked online for Owner's manual, could only find 2012 edition. Called Google Support and was put on hold, then told to look online. Told them I only found the 2012 manual. The support guy put me on hold again and came back to say ""oh yeah, they don't have that one posted online yet. Keep checking back"". Using the 2012 manual and online tutorials as a guide, first charged the Nexus, then turned it on and began the setup process. Got exactly 2 steps. Clicked on US-English, pressed the Play button. Next selected our WiFi, entered the password, and the Nexus confirmed it was ""Saved and Secure"". And then it stopped. Literally, the Nexus shut itself off. Not sleep mode, but totally off. Started it back up again, got as far as WiFi - setup died right there again. It didn't prompt for the next step and the only other thing visible was the back button. And so we kept cycling between Welcome and Wifi. Called Google Support half a dozen times trying to fix it. None of them seemed to have any experience with any Nexus. They kept putting me on hold for minutes while apparently looking things up. We walked through Wifi setup at least 3 times again. Then they suggested a Reset, which the device wouldn't even perform, despite many prompts from Support to ""now try doing it this way...now press Vol first, then Power, then shut it off again, then press Vol and Power together - oh that's not working? Now just toggle them back and forth..."" etc. While put on hold several more times, the device shut itself off again. My router is one of the types supposedly compatible with Nexus. My other devices don't have a problem with it. While trying to solve this problem I found a lot of comments on various forums about the Nexus dropping wifi connections where other devices did not. But that's another story I guess... Finally Google Support suggested returning the Nexus to BB. I don't need to think about that twice. Back it goes after less than 24 hours ownership. This has never happened to me with any other piece of electronics and needless to say, the family member I bought it for is deeply disappointed. Definitely looking for a small laptop instead."
B00DVFLJKQ,279,2784,Piece of Junk!,shanda,1,-,01-Oct-13,4,27,"The following review is of a Nexus 7 tablet that I bought in January 2013. As I found out later, the version I have is 2012...but I have chosen to keep this review here as well, as I feel the information is relevant to the potential buyer. You will of course make your own decision, as I did, to buy the tablet or not. I still have not received a working tablet as of October 3, 2013.
**I bought the nexus 7 after reading some glowing reviews. The first tablet I had to return to the store because the internet did not work, right out the box. The second tablet did not rear it's ugly head till a month later, right after the return warranty for the store...getting hung up intermittently, then being hung up to the point it would not shut off. I called tech support, their answer to everything is to wipe the system clean, which it would not, so I had to send it in. 6 weeks later they send it back saying it was the battery. The same thing happened a month later and had to go thru the whole process again. This time they said it was the mother board, but I asked them for a replacement as I noticed the side of the tablet was a little loose. They would only give a refurbished product, not new. So essentially I just paid all this money for a used product. I just received someone else's tablet that did not work. When received it back, 6 weeks later, the unit would not hold a charge. Another call to tech support they said to wipe it clean again! Oh gee, I would have to send it back again! I could not believe it! In the time I have had this unit, 10 months, it has never worked properly, I have been without it most of the time, the company has known issues with this tablet and refuse to give you a brand new product or even compensate you at all for all the inconvenience and heartache this $250.00 piece of junk has given me. The products warranty now expires in a couple months and I have yet to be able to enjoy it. I did buy the extended warranty at the store, but you have to go thru ASUS first, and really, recycling a piece of junk over and over is going to give you what you had in the first place. Do yourself a favor and get another brand, as they do not stand behind their product."

B00DVFLJKQ,279,2786,SD missing from the new Tablet,Tampa8,3,-,26-Jul-13,26,12,"First to be clear I ended up not buying the new version after using it for a day. I do think the screen is better, not knock out better but can be seen. My problem is that there is still no SD card. Not having an SD card will keep me from buying any Tablet. I keep extra movies on it, and actually have a ""travel"" card that does not have all the apps I don't need while on vacation or traveling off of it, and more movies, and personal data that I do need plus more apps that would be used for traveling. The Cloud is just not a good substitute for such a device.

You can use a slimport for HDMI out but does require buying and having with you another adaptor, but at least it has it.
In reality, though not quite as good a screen, my Panasonic tablet, which also to an extent is waterproof, has all those features and more and for traveling is better for me, and my Daughter decided to keep her original version.
If the SD card is not important to you, this can be a very good tablet. As posted above in another review I do think it is faster than the original.

NOTE - my review was modified to reflect the slimport."
B00DVFLJKQ,279,2787,Beware Another Laggy Android Tablet & No SD Card?,SL,1,-,29-Jul-13,15,51,"I just tested this out at Best Buy. I saw laggyness when opening many apps. That's what I expect from Android King of Laggyness and just like Android phones lags and crashes. Also what a joke NO SD Card to further expand your storage. All talk of this tablet is size, screen and hardware has big deal. Most tablets have same features.
Once I saw laggyness and No SD Card I just threw this piece of crap tablet back to the shelves. People buy this Android just for the design looks

Also can't even remove the bloatware apps that is installed from company another big joke.
At least windows 8 tablet you can remove anything and install anything which offers no restrictions. Below is my opinion on this tablet.

The highs
*Powerful hardware
*The sharpest 7-inch display on any tablet, with 323 pixels per inch
*Great sound system
*Great battery life

The lows
* The user interface is still not lag-free.
* NO SD card slot(what a Joke), so no easy storage expansion, which I find annoying.
* A no-frills tablet
* Same old cluttered apps
* Bloated Apps which you can't remove. Typical android.

Here's Advantages why prefer Windows 8 tablets have over laggy and bloated app Android.

1. Multiple users account - each user with his/her own account and all files and settings belonging to each will be protected. It's like each user having it's own tablet within one device.

2. Multiple monitors
3. Use any peripherals
4. Ability to run and display two apps side by side. (Android can't do that because you knows what happens if you open multiple apps it will lag which is what android are good at)
5. Full blown file manager
6. File encryption - Secure and encrypt your hard drive in case you lost or stolen tablet)
7. Pen support
8. Run any web browser (users aren't restricted)
9. Run powerful software (Photoshop, AutoCAD etc..)

Beware this person CC Reviewer. CC just can't get over it that Nexus 7 has No MicroSD. But w3 has a MicroSD. Don't be fooled by this person comments. This person will make up negative comments on products he never purchased or ever used it."
B00DVFLJKQ,279,2788,I have had it about 2 weeks now,Feline Lover,4,Yes,18-Oct-13,-,0,"I really like my Nexus and the stereo sound quality is on par to my Kindle Fire HD. I was really surprised and happy to find this out. So far this tablet has performed very well. Picture quality is excellent and I can download so many more apps. It charges up really fast when not in use. But still charges up faster than the Kindle Fire when I am using it and charging at the same time. And the battery stays charged for a longer time. One charge will last 38 + hours on standby. The touch screen is a more responsive than the Kindle Fire. The keyboard is quick to respond.

Of course, there are times when the touch screen does not respond as well. But I believe that is caused by the stylus wearing down. I will see, because I bought some more styluses to try out. Fiber mesh styluses. So that is the one issue I have, right now, with the Nexus. However, with the new fiber mesh stylus, I have not had any respond issues with the touch screen. So I beliee I solved that problem. The same thing also happened on my Kindle Fire. But all-in-all, this is a very good tablet. I like the way it responds with a good stylus pen and I love the sound quality and picture quality and the size. I do not like gigantic tablets. Oh, and one can set the wi-fi to go off when the tablet is in sleep mode and it comes right back on when I start using it again. So I can really conserve energy this way."

Nothing worst than hiking 10 miles to see some spectacular things in nature only to find out the image could have been a little sharper once I'm at my computer.

Researched replacing the battery and it's not worth it so I used my Amazon credits and got a new tablet. It's great! Faster and more streamlined than the 2012 version. Very very happy with it! Still the best 7"" tablet on the market and so inexpensive (especially using credits)! Was going to wait for the new one coming out this Fall but decided to just get this one."
B00DVFLJKQ,280,2793,"Easily the Best sub-10"" Tablet on the Market",James R.,5,Yes,05-May-14,14,0,"First of all, I was shopping for a new device to control a camera drone, and the software it used had 3 main requirements: built-in GPS chip, USB OTG, and Android only - not iOS compatible. That meant no Apple this time, so after some research on Android devices with the requirements I needed, I decided on the Nexus 7 because it is the reference device for the Android operating system - no bloatware, no custom interface, just vanilla unmodified Android.
Now then, I want to say up front that I am an avid iPhone owner - as well as a Macbook Air owner. I like the apple ecosystem. I use iCloud. I also used to have an iPad, then an iPad 2, and then an iPad Mini (all sold because I didn't use them that often). When it came time to get another tablet, logically I would be a candidate to get another iPad - yet after using the Nexus 7 FHD (2013) for the last couple of weeks now, I already feel like it's been much more of a value and way more useful than any of the iPads I've owned - here are my thoughts:

Impressive Audio/Video
For a sub-10"" tablet, the Nexus 7 offers up an excellent audio/video combination. The 1920 x 1080p full HD screen is bright, vivid, and crystal clear. The colors look very good, there seems to be no streaking or blurring during video playback, and the 16:9 ratio is perfect for watching movies on Netflix or POV action camera footage. Compared to my old iPad Mini (non-retina) there is a noticeable difference in clarity and crispness - understandable because the iPad Mini only sports a 1024 x 768 resolution - for double the price.
Also impressive is the audio. The Nexus 7 features two stereo speakers at the bottom rear of the case. Much louder than the iPad Mini, the sound also seems more crisp; I'm not sure if this is due to the built-in ""synthetic surround sound"" software, but if the sound sounds excellent to my ears, I don't really care how it's achieving it.
As for the on-board camera, by the numbers the Nexys 7 matches the iPad Mini - 5MP rear camera, 1.2MP front camera. I've taken a few photos with the rear camera just for testing, and the photos come out just fine (though to be honest I always prefer using my phone camera over a tablet camera). The front camera was tested using Skype, and those on the other end informed me that they couldn't tell a difference between iPad Mini and Nexus 7 video quality, so no big deal here.

Getting Used to Android OS
The Nexus 7 ships with Kit-Kat 4.3, but as of this writing the current version is 4.4.2. My Nexus 7 started downloading the 4.4.2 update in the background once I got connected to my home WiFi, while I was still doing the intial device setup. By the time I was at the home screen ready to use the tablet, the download was ready and it took a couple of minutes to get the device up to 4.4.2. Using the Android operating system took some learning to do - this from for someone who's never spent any time with Android, and is super familiar with the iOS operating system. In fact, I did find myself doing iOS things only to find that they do not work - for example, iOS gestures. This isn't a knock on Android at all though - this is just a case of me having to learn my way around a new operating system. However, after a few days I was comfortable using Android, and within 2 weeks of purchase I'm pretty confident that I can get myself around Android just as good as with iOS.

SD/Micro-USB Port
There are some complaints about how the Nexus 7 does not have a removable SD card slot like other Android devices, however when compared to the iPad Mini you could easily say the same thing. What gives the Nexus 7 the one-up is its standard micro-USB port. Not just for charging, the micro-USB port is compatible with standard USB flash drives, external hard drives, and more. All I have to do is plug the flash drive into the Nexus 7 and I can transfer movies, music, and other data files directly, with no need to connect to a computer and use extra software.
I can also plug my GoPro or Contour POV action cameras and watch recorded footage on the Nexus 7 - directly from the camera's SD card, no need to copy the video files to the Nexus 7 beforehand, no media format conversion either. Just to be clear, unless you have a USB flash drive with a built-in micro-USB plug, you will need an inexpensive $4 OTG cable that converts the micro-USB to standard USB Type-A. In comparison, the above scenarios are not available with an iPad mini without a bunch of extra steps involving iTunes, media conversion, and dealing with their super-restrictive Lightning cable.

iCloud Syncing
Probably the biggest question I had when I decided to use the Nexus 7 as my primary tablet was getting it to work in sync with my primary phone (iPhone) and primary computer (Macbook Air). I rely on iCloud for certain important data - specifically contacts and calendars. I already use Gmail so that's not a problem, nor is Google Docs - both of which function as expected under Android. However, when it came to contacts and calendars I use iCloud, but it turns out that there are free apps in the Google Play store that let my Nexus 7 sync my contacts and calendars in both directions with iCloud - problem solved, works seamlessly. I have my important data synced across platforms, which is always convenient.

Battery Life
Being used to the iPad Mini's 6,471mAh battery life, I'm not surprised nor bothered at all that the Nexus 7 doesn't last as long; The Nexus 7 battery is 3,950mAh, and under regular usage I found that the battery life of the Nexus felt about 1/2 to 2/3 of what I remember my iPad Mini having. I did not scientifically test this - I'm just going by what I remember from having an iPad Mini before, but even if it doesn't last as long, the Nexus still can last the whole day for me; I always charge before I go to bed so that the device is at 100% in the morning, and the lowest I've seen the nexus 7 battery go down to in the late evening is about 20%.

There is no home button, because this is not an iPad. I was so used to waking up my iPad by tapping on the home button, but with the Nexus 7 this is not the case; the sleep button is on the side of the Nexus 7, so it's not as convenient to use since the tablet might slide around if you try to push the sleep button on the side without holding the tablet first.

Apps
The Google Play Store is not as expansive and vast as the Apple App Store, but there are many quality apps available, plus some features that aren't available or take more steps to do on the Apple App Store. One example is remote installation: I can browse Google Play apps on my desktop browser at home or work, purchase an app (free or paid), and install it with the click of a button to my Nexus 7 - even if the actual tablet is somewhere else. No need to fire up iTunes, no syncing, nada. The flipside to that is refunds - many Google Play apps have a timed refund button on the app page itself; if you buy a paid app, install it, and find that it's not really what you were expecting or looking for, you can click the ""refund"" button on the app page and Google Play will refund your purchase and automatically uninstall the app from your tablet just like that. the last time I remember trying to get a refund for an Apple Store app, it involved looking for the invoice# and contacting Apple support through email and waiting for a response.

""Rooting"" (Optional)
When you ""root"" an Android device, you're not so much modifying the operating system, but you're basically giving yourself admin permission to access the OS. It's similar to having a basic user account on a PC vs. having administrator privileges. Once your device is rooted you can install and customize your Android device with anything from small tweaks to complete OS replacement. Unlike iOS, Android openly embraces device rooting.
In contrast - on iOS, to unlock the operating system and install outside apps, you have to jailbreak the device - which involves modifying the existing operating system. Though not illegal, Apple frowns upon this practice for the sake of integrity, and in return does all it can to disable/block jailbreaking with every update of its operating system. The current iOS version cannot be jailbroken, so those who enjoy jailbreaking and using outside apps/tweaks are stuck on an older version of the iOS (including my iPhone).

Chromecast (Option, $35)
Though optional, picking up a Google Chromecast is probably the best accessory for the Nexus 7. It allows me to watch video on any HDMI-equipped TV - Netflix, YouTube, etc. No longer am I limited to just the Nexus 7 screen - it's a nice screen yes, but sometimes I would like to sit on the couch and watch my entertainment on a large HDTV. Sure - you can do the same with iOS and an Apple TV - and Apple TV does more than just project remote video - but for simple movie viewing you're looking at spending $99 for an Apple TV compared to $35 for a Chromecast.

Bang for the Buck
Initially I was going to get the $199 16GB WiFi version, but I went with the $239 32GB WiFi version for some extra on-board storage. Aside from storage capacity, the hardware specs are the same - 1920 x 1080p resolution 7” HD screen, 2GB of RAM, 5MP rear and 1.2MP front cameras, GPS chip (even if it’s only a WiFi model), stereo speakers with “synthetic surround sound” and a quad-core processor are the important bits. At the time of this writing, the comparable iPad model (iPad Mini non-retina WiFi) with a lower resolution screen and no GPS chip costs $299 - $100 more than the Nexus 7. Because I chose to go with the 32GB version, the comparable iPad model is not the regular Mini, since it only comes in 16GB. I would have to get the iPad Mini with Retina (WiFi) to get 32GB of on-board storage, and that model is $499 - that's more than double the price of the Nexus 7.

Conclusion - I Really Like It!
Using the Nexus 7 is different form using the iPad Mini, and I think that is part of the reason why I'm a lot happier with the Nexus 7 as my daily usage tablet; I realized that I wasn't that happy with the iPad Mini because it basically felt like I was using my iPhone - with just a larger, not as crisp screen. The pricing difference between comparable Nexus 7 and iPad Mini models are another big factor - although a lot of people rely on specs and number comparisons to decide what is ""better"" I prefer to use my eyes and ears to judge what looks/sounds good to me, and the Nexus 7's crisp HD screen and loud stereo speakers make for an excellent audio-visual experience.
All in all it's only been 2 weeks and with everything I've been able to do with the Nexus 7, yet it's easily earned 5-stars from me. I can't see any reason not to strongly consider the Nexus 7 over an iPad Mini thanks to its impressive A/V capabilities, more useful features, and very reasonable price tag."

B00DVFLJKQ,282,2813,Best Value for a Small Tablet,HighwayMan,4,-,05-Sep-13,3,0,"I've been using a Kindle Fire since the day they hit retail at Best Buy. That thing was underwhelming. This thing though is phenomenal.

I was used to having to always zoom in on a first gen Kindle Fire when reading webpages. On this with its 1920x1200 screen, all of the text is sharp and easy to read. I zoom in far less often. The screen can also get incredibly bright and the automatic brightness adjustment (you can turn off) works great. The touch screen is responsive and I haven't had any problems with it. I am used to my Lumias 720 phone which has that super sensitive screen so it's touchscreen isn't as awesome as those Nokias but it is more than enough for me not to care.

The camera is ok. It does well enough in good lighting and well it's a tablet so I probably won't use it besides maybe the front facing camera for video chat but even then, I don't even like video chat. There is a power button and a volume button on the side. They are mediocre. They're too flushed with the body and they lack enough resistance when pushing.

The OS and software are great. My experience with Android is mainly older phones pre-4.0 and the Kindle Fire. Those things usually were pretty jerky. This thing though is smooth. I would say almost as smooth as my Windows Phone. With the app selection, it plays pretty much any media type that I throw at it. I haven't had the need to zoom in when reading comics or manga. It plays back very high bitrate 1080p files and MX Player was able to support all subtitles. All the media apps performed well with no hiccups in the stream quality. The updating widgets work well as well as the notification pull down menu. There are a ton of games and with this things quad-core S4 and Adreno 320 games fly no problem.

It's great having a full Android experience. With a Kindle it's a lot more limited. There are way more apps and you can DL really awesome file explorers/managers. I suggest everyone buy an OTG cable. I bought a cheap one off Amazon and was able to hook up my 3TB external HDD and use everything on it. If you don't root your device, you'll have to purchase Nexus Media Importer to see anything more than just photos but it's only like $3. I'm a student of computer engineering so this thing is nice that there are apps where you can write and compile code. It as well has come in handy for work. I was checking/updating inventory and the Excel sheet would taken a ton of paper. It was easier to just upload it to my Google Drive and work from there. The Google apps are great. I wish they would stop being so stingy and make them for Windows Phone but whatever I can deal with it. The gmail app pleases me much. With my experience with this tablet, I'm sure I'll go Android whenever I buy my new phone. Only negatives on this is the lack of an SD card slot and the poor buttons. The OTG cable is nice since you can use a SD card or External HDD with that but that is encumbering with a HDD and having a wire and SD card reader jutting out is not ideal. Also I wish they would start putting the usb/charging slot of the side of these devices like a lot of old phones used to. I wish I could charge these things while laying down and the bottom propped on my chest. The other side won't do since I need that headphone slot and I wouldn't want that on the side.

Overall best tablet for the money. You might as well splurge for the 32GB version. This thing is pretty swayed me to go Android for my next phone unless Ubuntu Touch suddenly becomes amazing in terms of app support. I can dual boot I guess."
B00DVFLJKQ,282,2814,Seems to work good,Sunnygirl,4,-,25-Dec-17,-,0,Bought locally for $20 had to solder the charge port then after that it’s been working great. Only thing is I don’t understand why the bezels are so huge I’ve never seen bigger bezels on anything and frankly they are very ulgy. Cameras are actually decent and surprisingly snappy even in 2017 still opens apps as fast as my brand new lg phone. Only real problem with it is the touchscreen will act funny and stop responding properly sometimes but a restart always fixes it. I would not even consider buying it for the price listed here and I generally stay away from anything with ASUS on it because most asus products are complete trash. This tablet seems to be an exception. Would recommend if you could get it for around $50-100
B00DVFLJKQ,282,2815,One of the best 7 inch tablets for your money.,Geo,5,-,26-Oct-15,1,1,"Possibly one of my favorite tablets I've ever owned. Running Android 6.0. Zero lag in the operating system. These are very, very fast little tablets. Nothing can slow it down. The web has changed since tablets and phones have started to be the main way people read the web. So more pages are able to be formatted and fit this type of screen (was not the case 5 years ago). Pretty much the size of a paperback book, which is nice. Had tablets that required two hands, or felt awkward to hold. Not this tablet, light and able to read comfortably in bed, watch movies, read, listen to music. Never used the Nexus 9, but wouldn't mind trying one of those as well since there is so much to love about this. NFC, wireless charging, blue-tooth, duel speakers. A lot of tablets released today, still don't have these features in 2015."
B00DVFLJKQ,282,2816,The best android tablet to date,Homer,5,-,03-Aug-13,8,0,"I pulled the plug and bought the new Nexus 7 having owned the previous Nexus for over a year. I did the research and went to the local stores and looked and tried many of the newer models. Included in the mix were the Samsung 8 inch, the Samsung 8 note, a Kindle and some of the less expensive tablets. I did play with the Apple mini.

Here are my final opinions based on now owning the Nexus.
1.) All things being equal, the Nexus has the best resolution.
2.) The Nexus boots quickly, it has a great screen, and performs flawlessly.
3.) The number of apps for the Nexus if more than enough for the average user. Both IOS and Android have over 800,00 apps. For the typical user,this is adequate. I am not so enamored with digital toys that I live my life on the internet. The number of ""useful"" apps for Android and Apple are near identical.
4.) The new Nexus has the latest and greatest Android operating system and is fully supported by Google.

Now, I did read some of the negative reviews. Some of them are clearly misguided. Yes, if you drop it, it will break. And it does not have a Micro SD card slot. And it has bezels, and it does not cook you breakfast or make eggs.

Come on, most of these reviewers are stating what they would like a tablet to be and have. I would love a 1 mm thin flexible LCD screen that I could put in my wallet, unfold, and then have full internet access with an LTE free data plan.

I would also like a car that get unlimited mileage without using any gas. However, this review is for the item that is being sold and the current technology. Not what I would like the item to have and how it should look.

For the current state of tablets, that being a review of everything out there, and based on the current technology, not the future of the computer world, this tablet is unbeatable.

I can't comment about bad pixels as mine is flawless.

The start up problems noted by others did not occur. I booted it up, entered my information, and it worked.

It logged into my Google account and I was able to sync my cell phone, tablet and computer with apps and e-mail information. And yes, I know that I have given up some privacy to Google to allow this syncing process, but I really don't mind for the convenience of cross-linking multiple devices.

So, in summary. Based on just about everything that is currently out there, great screen response, flawless screen, perfect performance, fast processing, small form factor, full software support, and great battery life, this is the tablet to buy.

And I did a side by side with the Apple Mini. My friend with the Apple felt mine had the better screen and form factor. He is an Apple fan and was loath to admit the the Nexus might, at this time, be the better tablet.

So, read the negative reviews with a bit of skepticism. Check out the products and if you buy this product, you will not be disappointed."
B00DVFLJKQ,282,2817,Great device!,L. Weiss,5,-,01-Oct-14,-,0,Love it. Holds charge for a long time. Great for watching movies during long flights and layovers in airports. Excellent internet connections. HD uses up more memory than standard. I have twelve movies and several TV seasons saved on my device. Holds a lot! Useless for Amazon movies.
B00DVFLJKQ,282,2818,The best tablet on the market right now!,Jetally,5,-,02-Aug-13,5,0,"As soon as you turn this tablet on and connect to your WiFi and the two updates run and than you sign into your Google account you can see instantly the screen is beautiful. Colors are bright and rich and reading text off of websites and books and magazines is ultra sharp. The CPU is ultra fast loading games at least 4 times faster than the original nexus 7. You can feel its quite a bit thinner and lighter than previous generations model.
The sound on this new nexus 7 is awesome. The additional speaker makes a world of difference. With the sharper screen and improved CPU and GPU games load faster and look better and no lag what so ever on the games I played.

The only thing Google didn't improve on is battery size. Since its a slightly smaller battery but the S4 pro CPU does do a better job in conserving battery life its slightly better battery than the original but not that much. I put my nexus 7 on the charger everyday anyways so not that big of a deal but next years model would be nice to see a 4500 rated battery instead of a 3950 for a few more hours of usage.

I am a tablet user where I multitask between many apps so the 2 GB of RAM this year makes a big difference in the speed of opening apps and switching apps and also can have a lot more apps open at the same time.

Let me finish this review with this statement:

I am not a techie band wagon jumper when new technology comes out right away to get it right away. The original nexus 7 I waited until November of last year which was 4 months after its release date. This year has been the first year and time I have gotten a new tech device at release date. Why? I been researching this product since the first part of April this year. I considered the product improvements was so much of a jump compared to last years model it was worth it to get the new one at release date.

If you looking to buy a new tablet consider this new Nexus 7! You won't be disappointed and even amazed how this tablet feels and looks and performs. The more I use this tablet the more I enjoy it!"
